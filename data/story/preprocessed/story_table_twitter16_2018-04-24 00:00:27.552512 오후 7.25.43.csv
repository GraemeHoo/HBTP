5.55am:Anthony Klan has been on the scene all night. This is his description of how the siege ended: At 2.10am three gunshots rang out in rapid succession - followed by a volley of gun fire - bringing to an end the 16 hour siege which had terrified the nation and captured the attention of the world.
As building fire alarms rang out a team of about six heavily armed tactical response police officers began throwing what appeared to be stun hand-grenades into the building.
Just minutes before a hostage had come running out from the building with his hands raised in the air, before laying down on the ground where he was approached by police.
A female police officer came running down the street yelling for assembled media to move back.

Those dead included a man, 34, and a 38 year-old woman.
Four others were wounded including a policeman who suffered non-life threatening injuries and a woman with a shotgun wound to the shoulder.
NSW Police said a “critical incident investigation” had been launched into the operation.
Witness Ehab Ibrahim this morning told The Australian it appeared as though something had “gone wrong”.
“It was like they were preparing and there was a big bang and then we saw rescuers running in and checking the faces of the police officers for injuries,” Mr Ibrahim said.
“Then there was a woman was screaming and pulled out holding her feet.”
Andre Balfe, an Irish tourist among those to watch the dramatic scenes unfold, described the events as “terrifying”.
“Nothing had happened for hours and then of a sudden everything happened so quickly, we weren’t expecting it, it all happened so fast,” Mr Balfe said.
“Initially (I felt) it was shock but now I’m happy it’s all over.”

The confirmation came after an escalation in the crisis about 2am, when five more hostages ran from the cafe where a gunman had been holed up with as many as 20 others since around 10am on Monday.
Initial television footage showed one man running out with his arms raised to police, who patted him down and escorted him to safety.
Minutes later, two more men and two women raced outside and were directed away by police.
Their escape was followed by what sounded like rapid gunfire as heavily-armed officers stormed the cafe.

Samer Alaoui told The Australian he and his two friends had come to the CBD to pay their respects to the hostages and to pray for them to be “freed and safe”. Mr Alaoui called for the hostages to “remain calm” as “God’s looking out”. “The positives, they always overcome the negatives,” he said. Mr Alaoui said the men knew nothing of the alleged perpetrator but
they had come to pay their respects having seen events unfold in the media. “We saw this on the TV and thought we’d come down here tonight instead of going to the gym,” Mr Alaoui told The Australian. The men, all muscular, bearded and in their 30s, attracted the attention of police, who held a 15 minute conversation with them. Mr Alaoui said the police had spoken to them and asked them routine questions because the police were on “high alert”. “We’re all Australians, we’ve been born and raised in this country,” he said. “We just want for the hostages to be freed and safe.”
SYDNEY SIEGE: What we know so far
9.00pm: Two of the hostages who fled the Martin Place cafe during the Sydney siege have been named as lawyer Stefan Balafoutis and Lindt Cafe employee Elly Chen.
Indian IT giant Infosys have also confirmed one of their employees is one of the hostages still inside the cafe.
8.30pm: A press conference has been held to give updates on the Sydney siege at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione suggested that the siege could last for days, saying NSW police had many officers involved in the operation but, “We are certainly looking to increase those numbers in coming days if this drags on,” writes Mark Coulton.
Mr Scippione urged the media and anyone else with contact to those inside the café to ask them to, “ensure the man inside speaks to police, speak to our trained negotiators.”
He refused to say if the five people who got out of the café had escaped or were released. He said: “We are just pleased to see them out.”
He added, “We have the very best negotiators in the world, on the job, right now,” and “we’re not in the business of speculating, we’re in the business of investigating.” He refused to give any details of the gunman but clarified that no one has been injured and they are only dealing with the one location at the Lindt Cafe. He says one hostage who fled went to hospital for a pre-existing condition.
NSW Premier Mike Baird said there would continue to be an exclusion zone around Martin Place tomorrow, and asked workers in affected buildings to work from home.

8.05pm: More than 200 onlookers continue to hover about Martin Place tonight, over ten hours after the Sydney siege at the Lindt store began, reports Anthony Klan.
All day hundreds of onlookers have gathered at the intersection of Castlereigh Street and Martin Place, staring east up the hill to the Lindt store where the siege has been steadily unfolding.
Throughout the afternoon casually dressed observers - it appears most office workers forced to exit their buildings had no desire to mill about - have hovered around the intersection. Most have spent much of the day taking photographs, videos - and “selfies”.
Several groups of travellers were seen posing in front of the police tape, while more “selfie sticks” appeared than seemed warranted given the circumstances.
Outside the Opera House this morning a couple of less than fortunate newlyweds were having professional romantic photographs taken while jostling with quizzical onlookers and a puzzled media.
7.45pm: AS the Sydney siege at a Lindt cafe in Martin Place passes the ten-hour mark, a lot of speculation and misinformation continues to flood social media.

7.33pm: NSW Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn has been speaking to the media in regards to the Sydney siege at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, where a gunman is holding a number of people hostage.
“Our approach is to resolve this peacefully. It might take a bit of time but that is our approach,” Deputy Commissioner Burn said.
“What we are seeing now is this unevolving as a negotiation that the NSW Police is undertaking with the person who is in the premises.
There is speculation about what he might want, but we have to deal with him on the level of police negotiation. We cannot be engaged in any speculation.
Deputy Commissioner Burn: “Our approach is to resolve the situation as peacefully as possible. The priority is the safety of all involved.” — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014
7.20pm: A line-up of ambulances stretch along Macquarie Street, outside the old Sydney Hospital, in case they are needed urgently at the Sydney siege site at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place, reports Brad Norington.
Police are maintaining an extended road block around the site from Hunter Street in the north, through Martin Place to the Supreme Court building near Hyde Park.
6.50pm: Hostages inside the Lindt cafe at the centre of the Sydney siege in Martin Place have been in contact with media outlets in regards to possible demands.
However, police have asked that they are not to be made public as they could jeopardise the safety of the hostages.
Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn says a resolution to the siege may still take some time.
Police are also monitoring social media after reports hostages are tweeting from inside.
6.30pm: 7News reporter Chris Reason has tweeted that he has been allowed back into the Martin Place newsroom, which overlooks the Lindt cafe where the Sydney siege is taking place.
Reason is reporting the gunman is rotating hostages and forcing them to stand against windows, sometimes two hours at a time. He is also reporting a mixture of men and women are being held hostage, but no children.
6.20pm: Here is the full statement from Prime Minister Tony Abbott regarding the Sydney siege taking place at Martin Place, where a gunman is holding a number of people hostage.
“I want to give you a brief update on the siege in Sydney. I have just chaired a meeting of the National Security Committee of the Cabinet, which was briefed by Premier Baird and Andrew Scipione, the New South Wales Police Commissioner, on the unfolding situation.
This is a very disturbing incident. It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.

“Nevertheless, I can say that New South Wales Police and other agencies have responded to this incident with great professionalism.
“Throughout the day, there has been nothing but complete and total cooperation between different Governments and different agencies.
“You can be proud of the way your police and security bodies have responded to the events of this day.
“I think I can also commend the people of Sydney for the calmness with which they have reacted to this disturbing incident.
“We are a free, open and generous people and today we have responded to this in character.
“Obviously, images have been beamed around our country and around the world.
“I have received messages of support from a number of international leaders and I thank them for their encouragement on this difficult day.
“Yes, it has been a difficult day. Yes, it is a day which has tested us, but, so far, like Australians in all sorts of situations, we have risen to the challenge.”
I was briefed overnight on the siege in Sydney. It's deeply concerning and my thoughts are with all those caught up in it. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) December 15, 2014
6.11pm: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has made another statement regarding the siege at a Sydney CBD cafe.
“This is a very disturbing incident,” Mr Abbott said. “It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation. I have received messages of support from world leaders and I thank them for their encouragement on a difficult day.”
5.34pm: Anthony Klan reports: Police, state emergency services and welfare organisations are preparing for a long night ahead, setting up large tents at the northern end of Hyde Park in the city’s CBD, a handful of blocks from the Sydney siege at the Lindt store.
Two large white tents have been erected and pallets of bottled water are being forklifted into the area, as scores of aid workers prepare to deal with the fallout from the ongoing saga.
About a dozen workers from the NSW Department of Community Services disaster welfare division are congregating in the area, which will be the base point for those involved in today’s counter terrorism efforts.
“We’re just here to help anyone who needs it,” said one NSW government disaster welfare worker.
Much of the northern end of the park has been cordoned off, with State Emergency Services and NSW Fire Service vehicles supplying goods.
One NSW disaster welfare representative said personnel were there “to help police with a situation” but declined to comment further.
5.25pm: Brad Norington reports: It is believed at this stage that a lone gunman is holding a group of customers and staff hostage in the Sydney siege that started close to 10am.
Police are understood to have been engaged in negotiations with the alleged hostage-taker. The city around the siege site has been closed off, although police security involving a wider area has eased.
The release of the two women staff members minutes ago followed an earlier incident in which three men were seen escaping by a side exit after being held since the siege began.
Police have now pulled back a road block in Sydney’s Phillip Street to Hunter Street which has a clear view to the Lindt shop. The building above, which has been evacuated, normally houses some of Sydney’s top barristers at Frederick Jordan Chambers.
5.18pm: This is video of the two female staff members fleeing to safety.

Airline stocks suffered after media speculation about Sydney airport closing to traffic, while bank stocks were hit as ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, and Westpac closed some branches in the city.
Earlier, traders cited the siege as a factor in the continuing slide in the Australian dollar, which touched a new four-and-a-half year low.

4.49pm: Queensland Premier Campbell Newman has reassured Queenslanders there is no safer place to live in the wake of the Sydney siege.
Mr Newman said his thoughts and prayers were with the hostages being held at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place, as well as their families and friends.
“Let us hope that this can be resolved peacefully without any violence, without any loss of life,” he told reporters in Brisbane.
4.46pm: The Grand Mufti of Australia has said he felt devastated by the siege. “The Grand Mufti and the Australian National Imam Council condemn this criminal act unequivocally and reiterate that such actions are denounced in part and in whole in Islam,” Professor Ibrahim Abu Mohamed said in a statement.
“We along (with) the wide Australian society await the results of the investigation about the identity of the perpetrators and their underlying motivations behind the criminal act.” Australian Federation of Islamic Councils past president, Rehin Ghauri, said he was gravely concerned for his “Australian brothers and sisters”.
“Holding people hostage like this is totally, absolutely and honestly un-Islamic,” Mr Ghauri said..
He hoped those behind the attack were “quickly apprehended and brought to justice”.
4.40pm: Charles Sturt University’s counter-terrorism expert Associate Professor Nick O’Brien has warned that the siege could continue for some days.
“Police will be there assessing how they can deal with the problem. The first step will be negotiation and then something harder and they’ll even be thinking of handing it over to the military,” he said.
4.34pm: You can see Chris Kenny telling Sky News in this video how he witnessed the start of the siege

4.17pm: As it is confirmed that one Lindt employee and two customers have been freed, we return to that press conference with NSW deputy police commissioner Catherine Burn. Ms Burn said police did not yet know why the gunman was taking the action he has.

“We know have numerous police working on who this person is and what those motivations might be.” The number of hostages in the Martin Place cafe is not clear, but Ms Burn said it was less than 30.

COMMUNITY: Islamic leaders offer assistance

Martin Place has several prominent buildings, including NSW Premier Mike Baird’s office, the Reserve Bank of Australia, Westpac Bank and the Commonwealth Bank headquarters as well as the US embassy and Network Seven. The Supreme Court, Sydney Hospital, NSW Library and NSW parliament are all nearby and have been shut down for the day.
3.19pm: Macquarie Radio has reported the gunman has told negotiators he has “devices all over the city” and wants to “speak with the prime minister live on radio”.

But Mr Hadley said he refused to enter into negotiations or broadcast any demands from the man, publicly urging him to talk to police instead.
“The media can’t play a role in negotiating with people purporting to be from Islamic State holding hostages at a café in Sydney,” Mr Hadley said. “It is the job of authorities to solve this problem … who have the expertise to deal with these matters, not with radio broadcasters.”
Mr Hadley said he was being pressured to say things “that we simply cannot say” because his “message had been hidden from the public”.
“It has not been hidden from the public,” Mr Hadley said. “Judging by the email traffic everyone in the world knows what’s happening in Sydney at the moment. You’ve made your statement.”

SYDNEY SIEGE: Police ‘tested’ over hostage situation
2.51pm:Darren Davidson writes: Car-sharing service Uber has defended itself against accusations of price gouging after raising prices in the Sydney siege because of the ongoing hostage situation.
The US brand, which has earned a whopping valuation of $US18.2 billion based on word of mouth and cool credentials, is facing a rare social media backlash following complaints from customers.
The app has quoted a fare of $145-$184 from a trip from Pitt Street to Sydney airport, roughly four times the normal fare.
As it came under fire from social media users, Uber said the price hike was initiated to attract more drivers to the CBD.
2.45pm:Jared Owens writes: Treasurer Joe Hockey has cautioned Australians against being intimidated by the Sydney siege. Mr Hockey, who has urged Australians to stimulate the economy by spending for Christmas, said: “I don’t want to pass immediate judgment on what’s happening in Sydney but I just say, look, we cannot allow these events to shut down our country, to shut down who we are as an Australian people.
“We will not be intimidated, no matter how horrific these events can be we cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated by people who try to bully us and threaten us.”
Mr Hockey said the Reserve Bank, situated “right next-door” to the Lindt Café, is operating normally and he is in regular contact with governor Glenn Stevens.
2.40pm: Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews has said he is closely watching events in Sydney. He has offered the people of Sydney his best wished.

JustineFerrari reports: from the joint press conference of NSW Premier Mike Baird and NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione: Police are still unsure of the motivation behind the gunman holding a number of hostages. Mr Baird and Mr Scipione confirmed there was one armed offender holding “an undisclosed number of hostages” but he said police were yet to establish direct contact with the gunman.
“My advice is we haven’t had contact with the armed offender,” he said. “We’re still not in a position to determine where the individual is from.”
Mr Scipione said at this stage police were treated it as a hostage situation but were “on a footing consistent with a terrorist act”.
Mr Baird said the people of Sydney were being tested but he had full confidence in the police, who had acted decisively.
“We are being tested today in Sydney. The police are being tested; the public is being tested, but whatever the test, we will face it head on. We will remain a strong, democratic, civil society,” he said.
Mr Scipione said there was no connection with the arrest early this morning of a man in Beecroft in Sydney’s northwest by the counterterrorism taskforce but police were checking a number of calls on a range of threats, including explosive devices in the city. All had so far proved false.
Hundreds of police had been mobilised, including those specially trained for terrorist threats, tactical officers and negotiators to general duties officers and traffic police handling road closures.
Mr Scipione urged people to stay calm with reports sprouting around the city of other areas being evacuated or locked down, saying the action was concentrated in a small area in the Martin Place area.
“People see a police vehicle drive down their street and think they’re suburb or shire may be involved. That’s not the case, “ he said.

10.50am: Channel 7 is reporting that the man may also be carrying explosives.

In all, up to 1.6 million people gathered at the rally in Paris - 3.7 million at events across the country - making them the biggest in French history.
20.44 A fantastic photograph from our man Heathcliff O'Malley , showing what it was all about in Paris today.
20.35 Benjamin Netanyahu's message to French Jews, that they have a home waiting for them in Israel, and his government's plan to help step up immigration from France, have been criticised as insensitive. Allison Kaplan Sommer, writing on the Haaretz website, says that it is too soon after the attack on the kosher grocery store to be making such statements.
But there's a right and a wrong way to go about it, and Israel's unsubtle ham-handedness is clearly the latter. Statements like Netanyahu's sends a message that Israeli government, in a perverse ""I told you so"" manner is glad that Jews abroad are threatened because it strengthens their raison dﾒetre.
20.20 Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is speaking at the Grand Synagogue in Paris. He has thanked Lassana Bathily, the Muslim employee of a Jewish supermarket who saved several hostages on Friday, and said he appreciated the ""very firm position"" taken by French leaders against ""the new anti-Semitism and terrorism"" in France.
Our common enemy is radical, extremist Islam - not normal Islam.
20.10 And here is the line-up of world leaders, arms linked in a show of solidarity. That's Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, the president of Mali, in a central position next to Francois Hollande. And it would be wrong - at an event like this - to draw conclusions about David Cameron's peripheral placement. But you don't need to look too closely to see Benjamin Netanyahu's security detail.
19.59 A lot of anger and confusion in the US and beyond about why John Kerry or a similarly high-ranking figure is not in Paris. Barack Obama has sent Eric Holder, the attorney general, who may not be well known in Europe but is actually very close to the American president, to attend the security summit. So it's odd that - according to the US Embassy in Paris - he has not attended the march. The US is instead represented by its ambassador.

18.36 Street protests in France often end in violence, with the CRS riot police battling hard core elements that loiter after the peaceful protesters head home.
But, says Rory Mulholland, on Sunday's giant unity march in Paris, the crowd applauded and shouted ""bravo"" and ""merci"" as police trucks began to pull out of Place de la République as the demo wound down.
Earlier, as the marchers proceeded towards Place de la Nation, many said a policeman positioned on a rooftop was spotted by the crowd and treated to several minutes of applause. He finally acknowledged the tribute with a thumbs-up.

18.30 Western intelligence agencies have reportedly intercepted communications from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which indicate that the attack on Charlie Hebdo is the start of a campaign of attacks in Europe, Justin Huggler writes.
The US National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted the messages from Isil members shortly after the Paris attacks, according to a report in Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The messages also referred to Rome, the newspaper reported, but no concrete plans are known.
In the same report, Bild claimed that MI5 has warned Britain’s European partners of possible attacks on aircraft using explosives that cannot be detected by airport security.
Western intelligence agencies are concerned that the Paris gunmen may be part of a larger network, the newspaper reported, adding that the US has preliminary evidence that the brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi had contacts in the Netherlands.
In German intelligence circles, it is assumed that the Paris gunmen had contact with other militants, but there is no evidence whether the attacks were ordered by a particular organisation, Bild reported.
The NSA succeeded in breaking a code used by Isil in its communications some months ago, the newspaper said.
18.26 Morocco's foreign minister, Salaheddine Mezouar, snubbed the mammoth march against extremism through Paris on Sunday due to the presence of ""blasphemous cartoons depicting the Prophet"", the ministry said, AFP reports.
He nevertheless went to the Elysée Palace to present the country's ""sincere condolences to the French president and to the French government following the despicable attacks in France this week"".

18.07 AFP now reporting at least 3.3 million march against extremism in France. It's believed up to 1.5m marched in Paris alone, and many thousands more across the world including in Montreal where 25,000 showed their solidarity with France.
The day began with crowds gathering and Ahmed Merabet's memorial service. Mr Merabet had been the French Muslim police officer killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack. His brother thanked everyone for turning out to rallies and said ""it meant a lot to us"".

17.48 According to French officials, this rally is the largest demonstration in French history.
17.36 The march is coming to an end as thousands rally together at Place de la Nation
17.30 The massive turnout is, according to French TV, unlike the country has seen since the 1944 Liberation of Paris from Nazi occupation, AFP writes.
17.14 Police in Belgium have reportedly arrested a man suspected of making a bomb threat against Le Soir newspaper today, writes Harriet Alexander.
Le Soir names him as Thierry Carreyn, a 53-year-old who in 1999 blew up a phone box outside the offices of Vlaams Blok - the far Right Belgian political party, now called Vlaams Belang.
17.06 The crowd was so dense in Place de la République that it took nearly an hour for its to start moving out of the square after the official start of the march, reports Rory Mulholland from Paris.
As the hundreds of thousands of marchers proceeded at a snail's pace towards Place de la Nation, there were frequent renditions of the Marseillaise national anthem, interspersed with chants of ""Liberté, Liberté"". Many marchers carried giant pencils in a tribute to the cartoonists killed in the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine.
Countless others sported banners with the Je Suis Charlie slogan that has become the rallying cry for the millions of French who condemn what they see as an attack on freedom of speech.
People who lived along the route of the demonstration hung out of their windows to shout support.
Mohammad Al Qadi, a Palestinian from the West Bank who is training to be a chef in France, said he had come to show that he too wanted to defend free speech and democracy.
But he said he feared there might be a backlash against his fellow Muslims.
""Muslims living in France feel worried because it's dangerous for us. There were attacks on mosques after the (Charlie Hebdo) attacks,"" said Al Qadi, who was carrying a Palestinian flag. ""I hope that French people will understand that Muslims are also French before they are Muslims.""

16.56 Reporters without Borders has condemned the presence of some of the leaders at today's march.
""On what grounds are representatives of regimes that are predators of press freedom coming to Paris to pay tribute to Charlie Hebdo, a publication that has always defended the most radical concept of freedom of expression?
""Reporters Without Borders is appalled by the presence of leaders from countries where journalists and bloggers are systematically persecuted such as Egypt (which is ranked 159th out of 180 countries in RWB’s press freedom index), Russia (148th), Turkey (154th) and United Arab Emirates (118th).""

16.43 Luke Heighton at Trafalgar Square shares this picture of the French flag projected on to the National Gallery. Boris Johnson on BBC said the projection was to show London stood in solidarity with Paris.
""Paris has been through a particularly terrible few days and we in London went through the same thing 10 years ago.
""We remember what the city went through and how we reacted: we came together, we didn't allow the terrorists to divide and sow the seeds of mistrust.""
16.33 The turnout in Paris alone is more than was predicted. According to AFP, one organiser says an estimated 1.5m people are in the centre for the march and AFP themselves say their tally of official tolls mean more than a million people rallied against terrorism outside Paris.
In Vienna, organisers say more than 10,000 people rallied in the Austrian capital.
16.26 In Paris, a Jewish man with a white rose spoke of the brotherhood he felt with a Muslim man who gave him the flower on BBC News. It was a powerful moment - symbolising what this march is intended to represent: we are all brothers and sisters, we are all human beings, and we are with the victims' families standing together during this tragic period. We are united.
Now the BBC's Chris Morris says Muslim traders are giving free flowers.

16.22 Still just as many here, despite the gathering darkness, Luke Heighton reports. The fountains below Nelson's Column appear to be lit up red, white and blue.
16.20 There's a sombre atmosphere at Trafalgar Square, with around 2,000 people braving the cold to come out in solidarity with the victims of the massacres in Paris, Luke Heighton writes.
Everyone is very clear why they are here - to defend the right to freedom of expression, including freedom of religious expression.
Everyone feels the same outrage at this week's events, but I've yet to find on person who thinks that Islam alone is the cause.
They cite everything from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the failure of successive governments in France and the UK to integrate its immigrant communities effectively.
But there is also anger that Islamist fanatics have been allowed to dictate the terms of public discourse long before the tragic events of last week.
Many of those I've spoken to also questioned whether politicians are the right people to bridge the divide, and they had little faith in the political process to heal division.
That was particularly true of many French people, who said they feared the events at Charlie Hebdo and the kosher supermarket siege would serve to bolster support for Marine Le Pen's Front National.
Emmanuelle Bigot, 39, from Paris, came with friend Emmannuelle Recoules, 40, ""because we have to stand up for free speech, and speak out against hate"".
Both women live in London, and said it was important to let the extremists know they were not winning.

Flag-waving Frenchman Sebastian came with his wife and daughter ""to defend freedom and to fight against antisemitism"".
He said it was important people came together to say 'No', and to show that ""together we are stronger than terrorism"".
There's been no trouble, and barely any police presence. In fact it's probably one of the best behaved and best dressed protest I've ever seen.
Overall the message people seem to want to convey is peace and tolerance, but there is genuine anger at what has happened.
16.07 Family members and relatives of the seventeen victims, including journalists and policemen, take part in the solidarity march on the streets of Paris
16.02 Belgian newspaper Le Soir has evacuated its offices after a bomb threat which it received shortly after 2.30pm (1.30pm in the UK), Harriet Alexander reports.
A caller said ""It's going to explode in your office. You're not taking us seriously."" The caller said that he was acting in the name of ""the extreme Left"".
The caller said that he had had enough of the coverage of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, which ""fuels the extreme Right.""
The caller is thought to have been identified, but police in Belgium are confirming this.
Le Soir's homepage
The offices were evacutated, and the journalists are waiting to be allowed back inside.
Many of the newspapers editors were at that time at a demonstration in Brussels ""against hatred"", and have rushed back to the offices.

15.37 The funeral for a French policeman shot dead outside the offices of Charlie Hebdo has been held in Paris, hours before today's massive march in memory of the victims, writes Harriet Alexander.
Ahmed Merabet, 42, was the first officer on the scene of Wednesday's attack, carried out by al Qaeda brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. The brothers shot Mr Merabet as he approached, and then fired at him point blank as he lay on the pavement.
On Sunday morning thousands of people gathered in the suburb of Livry-Gargan to the north east of Paris, standing in front of the town hall.
Mr Merabet grew up in the suburb, attending the Andre-Boulloche lycee, as one of five children of Algerian immigrant parents. He ran a cleaning company before joining the police force eight years ago, and worked hard for a promotion.
Read the full report here.

15.10 Some on Twitter are pointing out the hypocrisy of certain world leaders who don't have the best track record on free expression attending the Paris rally. For example, Turkey's PM Ahmet Davutoglu and ministers from Bahrain and Egypt.
Only recently Turkey was criticised for the arrests of scriptwriters and Zaman editor-in-chief, Ekrem Dumanli

14.59 Here in London, as aforementioned, there is a solidarity march in Trafalgar Square. The Telegraph's Luke Heighton is there where the square - not as crowded as France - is pretty full with people..
14.50 Lazio, who are playing against Roma, have Je Suis Charlie written on their T-shirts.

14.48 Hundreds of Israelis attended a rally at Jerusalem city hall on Sunday to express solidarity with the victims of last week's attacks, writes Robert Tait.
Many held up Je Suis Charlie placards while others displayed alternative signs in French reading ""I am a Jew of France."" A small number held up similar signs in Hebrew. The rally, organised by Jerusalem City Council, was addressed by Nir Barkat, the city's mayor, and Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar, its chief rabbi.
It came as Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister - attending a mass rally in Paris along with Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, and Naftali Bennett, the industry minister - announced that French Jews wishing to emigrate to Israel would be ""welcomed with open arms"".
Later his office announced that he had accepted the requests of the families of four French Jews killed by a jihadist during last Friday's siege of a Kosher supermarket to be buried in Israel. The funerals are expected to take place in Jerusalem on Tuesday.
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority leader, also came to Paris.
14.42 The US attorney general has said there is no ""credible information"" al-Qaeda was behind the Paris attacks.
""At this point, we don't have any credible information that would allow us to make a determination as to which organisation was responsible,"" Eric Holder said in an interview from Paris with ABC's ""This Week.""
14.38 In an interview ahead of the march (which you can watch in the video above), Mr Cameron disclosed that he will meet security and intelligence chiefs on Monday to discuss how to respond to the terrorist attacks in France, writes Steven Swinford.
He said: ""We are here to demonstrate that we all stand for the values of democracy, freedom, freedom of expression and tolerance.
""We in Britain face a very similar threat - a threat of fanatical extremism - and we have to confront that in every way we can.
""That means maintaining strong security, investing in our security services, it means being very vigilant.
""But it also means confronting the poisonous narrative of Islamist extremism wherever we find it. Whether in universities or schools or our prisons or throughout our society, we'll only defeat this threat if we use all of the means at our disposal to confront and defeat it.""
He added: ""If we make sure we have strong security, confront the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism, we make sure we all play our part then I believe we can defeat it, because in the end the values that we stand for - of democracy, freedom of speech, of tolerance - these are not values that make us weak, they are values that make our societies, our economies, our countries, they're values that make us strong.""
14.34 Masses of people are out in force and not just in France. More than 10,000 people marched through the Belgian capital Brussels on Sunday in solidarity with the huge rally in Paris, a police source said.
Police had counted ""between 10,000 and 15,000"" about half an hour after the start of the march, the source told AFP. A huge ""Brussels is Charlie"" banner in French, Flemish and English was hanging in the city centre.
14.31 Many of the leaders are arm in arm, showing solidarity on this important day. The families of the 17 victims are also marching in memory of their lost loved ones, killed during a three-day siege.
14.29 And the leaders are moving.
14.28 The leaders are together and should soon be on the move.
14.23 Francois Hollande, Italian PM Matteo Renzi, Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy, German chancellor Angela Merkel, British PM David Cameron, Turkey's PM Ahmet Davutoglu among other world leaders are preparing to march

14.17 Loud applause from the crowd in Paris but solidarity for the nation of Voltaire is wide as Ruth Sherlock tweeted:
14.13 The EU culture ministers have released this statement defending freedom of expression and vowing to protect creativity, AFP reports.
""We, the ministers of culture of the European Union, stand in solidarity to defend the freedom of expression and vow to protect the rights of artists to create freely,"" said the statement, issued by the current Latvian presidency of the EU.
The ministers said they ""do not accept terrorists' attempts to impose their own standards. Since time immemorial, the arts have been an inspiration for reflection giving rise to new ideas and fighting against intolerance and ignorance.""
14.08 At the Republique Square, spontaneous applause appears to have broken out, according to the BBC. The march will go down the Boulevard Voltaire to the Place de la Nation and will be led by the families who lost their loved ones during the tragic events in Paris earlier this week.
Rory Mulholland says they will then be followed by the leaders with the unified French public behind them - a mix of athiests, Muslims, Jews and more, Mishal Hussain on BBC reports.
14.05 There are leaders from more than 40 countries including Israel, Italy and Spain. But they're definitely not alone as this image shows the sheer numbers. The march is called the March of Unity and for those on Twitter, the hashtag appears to be #unitymarch
14.00 There are solidarity marches across the world including in Trafalgar Square, BBC News reports
14.00 The four killed by jihadist Amedy Coulibaly in a hostage drama at a kosher supermarket in Paris will be buried in Israel on Tuesday, a community spokesman told AFP on Sunday.
""The four families decided to bury their dead in Israel. The funerals will be held on Tuesday at 10.00 am in the Mount of Olives cemetery"" in Jerusalem, the source said.
13.58 David Cameron said the extremist threat will ""be with us for many more years to come"" as he met with other world leaders and the French president to join the march.
13.56 The leaders are on the move, they left the Elysée Palace and are on their way to join the march.
Hollande & Valls are leading their group out of the Elysee, to go to the march, which starts at Place de la Republique in an hr #UnityMarch — Harriet Alexander (@h_alexander) January 11, 2015
13.54 The entire crowd is clapping and chanting, ""Charlie Charlie"", says Rory Mulholland
13.53 We've got pictures of the French president welcoming world leaders. Mr Hollande (R) welcomes United Arab Emirates foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan (L) at the Elysée Palace in the image below.
13.51 ""I've lived in Paris for 14 years and have never seen any demo on this scale before. The avenues leading to the Republique, a square bigger than Trafalgar Square, are jammed with people as far as the eye can see with people trying to get on to the square. So many that no one is moving any more,"" adds Rory Mulholland.
13.48 Philippe Odiau, caretaker of a building on the 20th arrondissement of Paris, told Rory Mulholland he was here ""because simply to show we are here to fight against barbarity.
""The French republic is still on its feet. But above all I came here above all for the memory of Franck Brinsolaro, a bodyguard at Charlie Hebdo, killed during Wednesday's attack.
""He was a friend of mine and he lived in my building - it was 48 hours before we realised it was him.""
13.45 Rory Mulholland has this short dispatch from the scene at Republique Square:
The march will be taking two different routes as it is thick with people and difficult to move. The avenues leading to the square from all directions are absolutely throng with people and some people will not be able to reach the square.
The tricolour flag and Je Suis Charlie posters can be seen everywhere - and it's just started to rain. There are occasional bursts of the national anthem but there is a quiet and subdued atmosphere.
There are people climbing the statue of Mariane, the symbol of the republic - some are even hanging off the edge.
One man, dressed a green statue of liberty costume, is using a pencil instead of the torch. Vincent Renau, a banker from Paris, told me why he came here because ""there's been a terrible attack on the freedom of expression and on the French republic"".
On the issue of whether he was afraid, he said he was a little. ""But I'm here to say yes to life. We must carry on.""
13.19 The British, German and Israeli leaders were also joined by Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, all of whom will march through the French capital in the same demonstration - a world first, AFP points out.
13.09 David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Benjamin Netanyahu have arrived at the French presidency
12.59 News is breaking that the US will host a summit next month on the extremism challenge and how to fight ""violent extremism around the world"".
The meeting is likely to take place in Washington DC, the US attorney-general, Eric Holder, said.
12.54 Crowds continue to gather and Valerie Trierweiler appears to also be in the crowds.
BBC News was reporting that there could be more than a million people today at the march which will take place in just over an hour, but some estimates suggest it will be 700,000.

There is a heavy armed presence as you can see from this image of French soldiers on patrol around the Place de Nation in Paris, another big site in the march. The map below shows the march's intended route:
12.44 BREAKING Associated Press has more information about the shooting of a jogger in a Paris suburb on the same day as the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which has been linked to the gunman who killed a policewoman and four hostages at a kosher grocery, a prosecutor said on Sunday.
In a brief statement, the prosecutor said ballistics tests on shell cases from the shooting on Wednesday in Fontenay aux Roses linked them to the automatic weapon used by Amedy Coulibaly at the kosher store stormed two days later. The prosecutor said the jogger was seriously wounded.
12.43 From that meeting between interior ministers, they said there was an ""urgent and crucial need"" to share European air passenger information and strengthen the EU's external borders
12.32 BREAKING The French prosecutor has confirmed Amedy Coulibaly is linked to the shooting of a jogger, causing the individual to sustain critical injuries.
12.28 Louisa Loveluck points out that officials have been sent to Paris from both Egypt and Turkey, both among the biggest jailers of journalists in the world.
12.26 Tim Chester, Deputy Editor of Mashable UK, has shared this Vine via Twitter showing the crowds gathered at Place de la République two hours before the march.

12.21 Spain's interior minister, Jorge Fernandez Diaz, earlier said he intended to call for changes to the Schengen treaty allowing border controls. His proposal for change was in order to limit the movements of Islamic fighters returning to Europe from the Middle East, AFP reports.
""We are going to back border controls and it is possible that as a consequence it will be necessary to modify the Schengen treaty,"" he told the daily El Pais ahead of a ministerial meeting on the subject in Paris.
12.16 A circle of pens laid in tribute to victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre has emerged in Trafalgar Square
12.10 To give you some idea of the scale of the security operation around the march in Paris today, a total of 5,500 police, gendarmes and soldiers are being deployed across the capital, Harriet Alexander writes.
Just to protect the president and 40-odd other heads of state and world leaders - among them Benjamin Netanyahu, Angela Merkel, David Cameron, King Abdullah and Queen Rania of Jordan - will be 150 police, on 56 motorbikes.
For the main march, 2,200 men and women will be deployed for protection - including 20 teams of officers to detect high-risk individuals.
Snipers will be placed on rooftops along the route.
Two thousand officers and 1,350 soldiers will protect other sites across Paris - transport hubs, tourist sites, media offices, religious schools and public buildings.

12.06 ""There is not one country who did not wish to be beside France... I would like to say, with great gratitude, from the depth of my heart, from the French government and people, to thank the ministers for their solidarity, [and] their boundless friendship,"" Mr Cazeneuve added.
""I want to tell them from the depth of my heart, I will not forget the way that they have been beside us. Thank you very much for being here.""
12.02 Strong words from Mr Hollande: ""The entire country will rise up,"" he told ministers, according to his entourage, reports AFP.
12.01 Earlier today, Mr Cazeneuve welcomed the Home Secretary, Theresa May, before the start of an international meeting aimed at fighting terrorism
11.57 ""We have shared information about these foreign fighters and these networks. We have decided to reinforce our cooperation.
""To improve the efficiency of our fight against terrorism in all its form, [we must do so]"" Mr Cazeneuve adds.
11.55 ""We are determined to struggle together against them and we have,"" Mr Cazeneuve says
11.53 Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, is with his European counterparts and speaking in Paris at the Elysée Palace.
11.39 Liam Fox is also on Sky's Murnaghan, and earlier today we published a piece by the former Defence Secretary, urging for more access to be given to security services to protect the UK and better funding for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ.
The spending priorities of any government are usually a reflection of the values of the population it serves. If that is so, then we have to question the priorities of our country. At a time when we face growing and sustained terrorist threats, we spend more on the heating allowance for the elderly in a year than we do on the combined budgets of our security services – GCHQ, MI6 and MI5.
[O]ur security services need to be given access to the data they require to help to keep us safe.
When Snowden took data to China and Russia, some 58,000 files came from GCHQ, information that had played a vital role in preventing terrorism in Britain over the past decade.
It was not freedom-fighting – we should call treason by its name and those who assisted Snowden must be held responsible for their actions.

11.28 Turks have tracked Boumeddiene's phone to a Turkish border town on Jan 8, but it has since gone quiet, writes Ben Farmer
Turkish counter-terrorism officials have told the Financial Times they believe that Hayat Boumeddiene may now have passed into Syria and could be in territory held by the Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, known as Isil or Isis.
The fugitive is believed to have arrived in Istanbul from Paris via Madrid on January 2. CCTV images from Istanbul airport appear to confirm her presence, Turkish officials say.
A signal from her phone was then traced on January 8 to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, which is next to Isil territory in Syria. The town is known to harbour Isil sympathisers and the porous border is easy to cross. Her phone signal has not been traced since.
The French authorities only passed on Boumeddiene’s name to Istanbul on January 9. Turkish officials say there is no evidence any of the other attackers passed through Turkey.
11.25 Le Monde says there are rumours the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu may go to Jewish supermarket but it must stressed, there is no confirmation from Israeli embassy in Paris.
11.18 More from Rory Mulholland about the Charles de Gaulle news mentioned earlier.
An airport spokesman told the Telegraph that there was no terror threat at Charles de Gaulle and that the heavy police presence was due to the arrival in Paris of foreign heads of state to attend the march to commemorate the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.
11.14 The Telegraph's picture desk has created this gallery entitled: Crowds join 'Unity' march for Charlie Hebdo attacks, in pictures

11.10 Last night, five people detained in connection with the terror attacks were released from custody, the Paris prosecutors' spokesman said. The five were freed from custody late on Saturday
Family members of the attackers have been given preliminary charges, but Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said no one was in custody.
11.07 As people gather at the site of the Kosher supermarket siege, citizens of Paris tell Alastair Good why they believe the city, and the country, should not become divided by the terrorist acts of the past days
11.04 Le Monde is reporting that Terminal A at Charles de Gaulle airport has been shut down and that armed police officers are on the roof of the building, Rory Mulholland says
10.58 The New York Times reports on Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu's, comments as he was leaving Israel to head to Paris.
As he left, Mr Netanyahu invited French Jews to move to Israel and said he would attend a second rally of the French Jewish community.
I am going to Paris in order to participate in the rally, along with world leaders, for a renewed struggle against the Islamic terrorism that is threatening all of humanity, which I have been calling for years/
“I will say there that any Jew who wants to immigrate to Israel will be received here with open arms.""
10.50 Ahead of the rally this afternoon, security ministers for the EU, including Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden - and America held a meeting at France's interior ministry to work a out a joint response to the terror threat.
US Attorney General Eric Holder was also present.
10.42 Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, is on Sky News and said parliament needs to ""make sure laws looking at communications and security services are up-to-date"". It needs to be updated for ""online communication,"" he urged.

On the issue of Islam and terrorism, Mr Javid said: ""It's no good for people to say they're not Muslims - it's what they call themselves.
He later added: ""They try to take what is a good religion and warp it for their own means.""
Sajid Javid says on #murnaghan its not enough to dismiss the Paris terrorists as not Muslims, since they claim to be part of Islam — Sunny Hundal (@sunny_hundal) January 11, 2015
He also said: ""Freedom of speech is vital to any democratic society. What a newspaper, TV channel does, it's up to them, nothing to do with the government.
""People can object but it's not for any government to tell any organisation what to do.""
10.32 A funeral service for Ahmed Merabet, the French Muslim police officer, killed during the Charlie Hebdo attack on Wednesday along with 11 others, has been held.

10.21 More from Martin Evans in Dammartin-en-Groele:
This is the scene in Dammartin-en-Groele where tens of thousands of people have turned out for a unity rally. It seems like the whole town are here. They are singing La Marseillaise and chanting ""Je Suis Charlie"".
10.18 It's not just in Paris where people gather to remember and honour the victims. In this photo, members of Sydney's French community gather in the heart of the city to pay tribute to the Paris jihadist attack victims holding sheets of paper with the words: ""Freedom"" and ""Je Suis Charlie"".
10.17 The terrorists behind the Charlies Hebdo attacks have offended the values of Islam ""more than the cartoons ever did"", Britain's first Muslim cabinet minister said, writes Steven Swinford.
Baroness Warsi, the former foreign minister, said that her faith has been ""hugely damaged"" by the ""brutal slaughter in Paris"", which she said has ""rightly been portrayed as an attack on free speech"".
She said that while she personally finds cartoons satirising her religion offensive and ""unsavoury"", freedom of expression is more important.
In an article for The Sun on Sunday she said: ""I cannot say I understand why a satirical magazine could drive anyone to mass murder. As a person of faith and as a Muslim, I know the values and reputation of my faith – any faith – cannot be diminished by a cartoon.
10.10 After meeting with the French president, François Hollande, Roger Cukierman, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said Jewish schools and synagogues would be protected by the French army ""if necessary"".
""He told us that all the schools, all the synagogues will be protected, if necessary, on top of the police, by the army,"" said.
Mr Hollande will also visit the Grand Synagogue of Paris after the march, Mr Cukierman said.

09.56 Paris supermarket siege witness: ’It was like the end of the world’
Trapped in his flat inside the police cordon, witness Ian Ayres watched the deadly end to the Paris supermarket siege, he tells Alastair Good.
09.49 A video has emerged online showing Paris supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly pledging allegiance to Isil, reports Henry Samuel.
The Senegalese-born Frenchman justifies his actions in footage filmed some time before this week's atrocity.
Coulibaly was shot dead by police on Friday after holding a dozen people hostage in a Kosher supermarket.
During the hostage siege, he killed four people named by the French Board of Jewish Deputies as Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen and Francois-Michel Saada.
French police have launched in an intensive search for Coulibaly's wife Hayat Boumeddiene, describing her as ""armed and dangerous"".
More to follow.
09.40 The 17 victims from the Paris terror attacks: (Top row) Charb, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut (aka Cabu), Bernard Maris and Tignous (middle row) Elsa Cayat, Frederic Boisseau, Ahmed Merabet, Franck Brinsolaro, Philippe Honore aka Honore and Mustapha Ourrad (bottom row) Yohan Cohen, Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Francois Saada, Michel Renaud and Clarissa Jean-Philippe.
09.37 More details have emerged of Philippe Braham one of the four victims killed in the Jewish supermarket, reports Ben Farmer.
The father of four worked was a computer engineer who had worked as an insurance agent close to the supermarket.
Philippe Braham was a father of four, with one child was from his first marriage and three from his second marriage to Valerie, his brother-in-law, Shai Ben David told the Israeli news site, Ynet.
The couple had suffered another family tragedy three years ago with the death of their first son.
""This was an incomprehensible tragedy for my sister. She survived only thanks to his strength,"" Mr Ben-David said.
Mr Braham was described as an observant Jew who attended the synagogue in Montrouge, a Parisian suburb. His brother is the rabbi of the synagogue in Pantin, another suburb of Paris.
Mr Braham had dreamed of moving to Israel. ""He loved Israel. He buried his parents and son here. He was an observant man who never harmed anyone. He visited Israel many times, the last time was several months ago to bury his mother,"" Mr Ben-David said.
Refael Braham, Philippe's 14-year-old son from his first marriage, was in Israel when he learned of his father's death.
""He was very close to his father and took it really hard,"" the head of the French aliyah project in the Netanya municipality told Ynet. ""He has been crying and refusing to believe he lost his father.""
Refael said: ""Dad went to the supermarket to shop for Shabbat. When I was with him (in France), we'd go shopping together quite often. If I hadn't made aliyah to Israel, I might have gone with him this time as well and gotten hurt.""
09.18 BBC reports that as a tribute to those killed in the attacks, London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and the National Gallery with be lit in blue, white and red - the colours of the French flag.
09.14 French police launched in an intensive search for Hayat Boumeddiene, the 26-year-old partner of one of the attackers, describing her as ""armed and dangerous"".
She is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, responsible for the attack on the Kosher supermarket. During the hostage siege, he killed four people named by the French Board of Jewish Deputies as Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen and Francois-Michel Saada.
A source familiar with the situation said Boumeddiene left France last week and travelled to Syria via Turkey. A senior Turkish official corroborated that account, saying she passed through Istanbul on Jan. 2.
A senior Turkish security official said Paris and Ankara were now cooperating in trying to trace her but that she had arrived in Istanbul without any warning from France.
""We think she is in Syria at the moment but we do not have any evidence about that. She is most probably not in Turkey,"" the Turkish source said
09.02 When François Hollande joins the mass ""unity march"" today in Paris, it will be only the second time since World War II that a French head of state has joined a street protest, reports Rory Mulholland.
The last time was when president François Mitterrand, a Socialist like Mr Hollande, discreetly slipped into the crowd at a rally in May 1990.
That demo was against racism and anti-Semitism.
08.58 In an unprecedented show of unity, the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority will both attend the rally to honour the victims of three days of bloodshed, AFP reports.
Along with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, the king and queen of Jordan will be present at the rally.
08.57 The US secretary of state, John Kerry, vowed that no act of terror would halt ""the march of freedom"" as he expressed solidarity with the people of France after last week's Islamist attacks, AFP reports. Mr Kerry is currently in India.
""We stand together this morning with the people of France. We stand together not just in anger and outrage but in solidarity and commitment in confronting extremists.
""No act of terror will ever stop the march of freedom.""
08.46 Israeli and French media report the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman and economy minister Naftali Bennett will attend today's rally.
08.37 Reuters reports on an arson attack on the German newspaper, Hamburger Morgenpost. The paper, like many others in the country, printed the cartoons from Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine which was subject to a deadly attack in which 12 people were killed.
A police spokesman said that an incendiary device was thrown at the newspaper building in the night and documents were burned inside. Two suspects were arrested near the crime scene because they behaved in an unusual manner, she added.
The newspaper said on its web page that there were no people inside the building when the attack happened. Whether the arson attack was connected to the Charlie Hebdo cartoons was still under investigation, the paper added.
08.34 The march doesn't begin in Place de la Republique until 3pm, but already people are milling around in the grand square at the heart of Paris, reports Harriet Alexander.
Groups of people are wandering around reading all the signs and looking at the mosaics created on the ground out of pens and candles. Some artistic souls have even stretched cling film between two lamp posts and drawn a series of tribute cartoons on the plastic.
Three women have brought along the French tricolour flag, and are wandering around waving it slowly.
08.29 France's Sunday front pages and a Je Suis Charlie poster, published in Le Parisien for those joining today's huge march for the Republic to hold aloft.
08.24 The Prime Minister, David Cameron, is on his way to Paris, Sky News reports. Angela Merkel is also due to attend.
Prime Minister David Cameron says he's on his way to #Paris ""to march with the French people"" as thousands are to gather at solidarity march — Sky News Newsdesk (@SkyNewsBreak) January 11, 2015
08.20 Today in numbers: 5,500 military police, 'dozens of snipers', all of the Paris police helicopter fleet will be in the air. €0 - price of all RER and Paris Metro journeys, all day.
08.19 Some of France's most celebrated artists and celebrities also lend their support to today's huge gathering, reports Patrick Sawer.
They include the Algerian-born singer Enrico Macias, the actress Frederique Bel and TV presenter Karine Le Marchande, who said: ""I want to act so that we don't surrender. Our freedom to think, to express ourselves and to laugh are our greatest resources and they are in danger.""
Le Journal du Dimanche reports on the broad spectrum of political and religious opinion backing the march - with all but the far-Right Front National in attendance.
Amar Lasfar, president of the Union of French Islamic Organisations, tells the paper: ""This march will demonstrate that France is one and indivisible. Muslims are like all other French citizens, independent of their religion. The terrorists want to create a divide between Muslims and the rest of our society. But we are French and Muslim.""
Former French World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, the most capped footballer in the country's history, has travelled to Paris especially to join the march.
He told Le Journal du Dimanche: ""It's vital that we support the victims and that we don't sink into fear. To defend society we need to build solidarity.""
08.10 Turnout is expected to be significant after smaller 'pre-gatherings' across France gathered unprecedented crowds, in excess of 100,000 in some cities.
Map showing rallies on Saturday, January 10, 2015
08.10 Unity in the face of terror is the overriding theme of the day for France, it's people and the French media on Sunday, writes Patrick Sawer in Paris.
Most of the French press concentrates on preparations for today's March for the Republic, which is anticipated to draw as many as a million people to the centre of Paris to express their outrage at the attacks which left so many dead.
The papers all report on the impressive dress rehearsals for today's march, with an estimated 700,000 people having already demonstrated against terrorism on Saturday in some of France's major regional centres, including Nantes, Marseille and Toulouse.
Alag Bunyamin, a 45-year-old Muslim building worker from Paris's 11th arrondissement, where the jihadist attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo took place on Wednesday, tells Le Parisien he is marching on Sunday to ""show solidarity with the France which opened its doors to him 25 years ago"".
Katia Ben Mohand, 21, a children's activities organisor from Saint Denis, said she was marching to fight ""the climate of fear and suspicion of all Muslims"" which she says has gripped France. Henriette Leclerq, 85, from Sevres, who lived through the war and the Resistance against the Nazis, and said: ""Today we have to mount a resistance against those who threaten our freedoms.""
08.06 On Saturday, the interior minister, Bernard Cazaeneuve, said the march will be unique. ""A tribute to the victims of terrorist bullets.""
Yesterday, the far-Right Front National lashed out at the government for not inviting its president Marine Le Pen to join national political leaders in the Paris march.
08.03 More information from Rory Mulholland on the rally:
David Cameron and Angela Merkel will walk side by side with French President François Hollande and more than two dozen other leaders on Sunday to show solidarity in the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish grocery store that left 17 dead.
As they march, 150 plain clothes detectives will mingle with the crowd to protect them and a ""vast security perimeter"" will be enforced, with metro stations and roads around the centre of Paris closed.
The intended route of today's march
08.00 Good morning. Welcome to the Telegraph's live coverage of the aftermath of the shootings which have rocked Paris. As the French nation and the world reels from the attacks which killed 17 people and injured many, we'll be bringing updates of the latest reaction and the Unity rally in Paris today.
Up to one million people could attend the rally to remember the victims and heroes. Interior minister, Bernard Cazaeneuve, has said more than 5,500 police officers and soldiers will be present.
The French president, Francois Hollande, will of course attend and he will be joined by David Cameron, the UK Prime Minister, as well as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, as well as Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi.
The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is also expected to attend as well as Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's prime minister - and also one of the most high profile Muslim leaders to attend.",53749

A Star Nursery Hidden by Cosmic Dust NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray telescope has found what may be the youngest black hole ever spotted. It is only 30 years old. It is the remnant of a supernova called SN 1979C, which astronomers saw exploding in 1979. Like all black holes, its gravity is so powerful that it even pulls in light waves, making it invisible, but astrophysicists say it is 50 million light-years away, in a galaxy called M100.

Hubble Catches Star Eating a Planet For the first time, astronomers say they've detected a superstorm in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, a planet about 60 percent the mass of Jupiter, orbiting a star about 150 light-years from Earth. In the journal Nature, the team of astronomers from the U.S. and the Netherlands wrote that in the atmosphere of the planet HD209458b, a super wind is blowing at a speed of about 3,100 to 6,200 mph. ""HD209458b is definitely not a place for the faint-hearted ‚"" said Ignas Snellen, who led the team of astronomers. L. Calçada/ESO
How Did Jupiter Lose a Stripe? The Hubble space telescope has observed a planet being swallowed by its parent star. This artist's concept shows the exoplanet WASP-12b, the hottest known planet in the Milky Way galaxy. According to NASA, the planet is so close to its sun-like parent star that tidal forces have stretched the planet into an egg shape and it's so hot that it has expanded to the point where its outer atmosphere ""spills into the star."" Scientists expect the star to consume the planet in 10 million years. Hubble can't get a clear photograph the planet because it's too far away, but this artist's rendering is partly based on observations made by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, a new instrument that was added to Hubble last year.

Jupiter Loses a Stripe One of Jupiter's two main cloud belts has completely disappeared, to the surprise of scientists who study the solar system's largest planet. ""This is a big event,"" says planetary scientist Glenn Orton of NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab. ""We're monitoring the situation closely and do not yet fully understand what's going on."" The brown ring of clouds, known as the South Equatorial Belt (SEB), is twice as wide as Earth and more than twenty times as long. Orton thinks the belt may not have disappeared, but could instead be hidden behind other clouds. Scientists say the belt has faded out before. NASA

Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were the two hostages killed during the bloody climax.
Mr Johnson, 34, was shot dead after he tried to wrestle the gun from Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis inside the cafe just after 2am on Tuesday.
Ms Dawson, a 38-year-old whose children are all under 10, died in hospital. She was a barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers in Sydney's Phillip Street, opposite the site of the siege.
The remaining hostages were able to make a break for the exit of the cafe about 2am after the gunman began to fall asleep - more than 16 hours after he took 17 people captive.

Ms Dawson, who leaves behind her husband Paul and their children, Chloe, Sasha and Olive, was having a coffee with a pregnant colleague when the siege unfolded. Her children were unaware she was involved until Tuesday morning, the Australian reports.
One of the pregnant women in the cafe at the time, Julie Taylor, was also a colleague of Ms Dawson and had to be treated in hospital following the ordeal.
Lawyer Stefan Balafoutis was one of the first three men to escape the cafe about 3.45pm. He works in the 10th Floor Selborne/Wentworth Chambers, which is directly above Lindt.
Dressed in a bright blue blazer, 83-year-old John O’Brian, was the first out of the cafe when he escaped with Mr Balafoutis.
Marcia Mikhail, 42, was among those hostages forced to record a chilling video message listing the hostage-taker's demands. She was carried out of the cafe by two emergency services workers with blood running down her leg and is still recovering in hospital.
Harriett Denny, a fellow employee, ran from the cafe with five other hostages shortly before police issued their gunfire assault. The 30-year-old's father who lives in Queensland was forced to watch the horrific incident unfold on TV.
Viswakanth Ankireddy, a software engineer at tech giant Infosys, was working for Westpac in Martin Place when he was caught up in the siege. His Westpac colleague, Puspendu Ghosh, also escaped the siege unharmed.
Jarrod Hoffman, 19, and Fiona Ma were also among the hostages, the Daily Telegraph reports.
Selina Win Pe escaped unharmed after she was also forced to relay demands via a recorded message that were subsequently posted online during the siege.
Joel Herat, who lists his workplace as ‘Lindt & Sprüngli’ on Facebook, was another of the hostages to upload a haunting hostage clip on his YouTube account.
Within half an hour, the video was taken down by YouTube and the account was deactivated.
Paolo Vassallo, who was among the first hostages to escape on Monday afternoon, is a married father of three. After escaping, Vassallo was taken to hospital due to a pre-existing medical condition. He was later reunited with his family, reports ABC.

Visibily distraught men and women have been laying tributes for the two innocent victims of the siege
Ken and Rosemary, the parents of Mr Johnson, who was shot inside the cafe he had run for two years, released a statement on Tuesday.
'We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for.
'We'd like to thank not only our friends and loved ones for their support, but the people of Sydney; Australia and those around the world for reaching out with their thoughts and prayers.'
They also expressed their sorrow for the family of Katrina Dawson who also died.
The siege ended after less than two minutes of gunfire at 2.15am today. Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson died from their injuries, while several others were wounded:
Five hostages were injured in the shootout which left the gunman dead
Three women suffered gunshot wounds - a 75-year-old who was hit in the shoulder, a 52-year-old in the foot and a 43-year-old in the leg
A police officer was injured by gunshot pellets to his face. He has now been released from hospital
Two pregnant women, aged 35 and 30, are both in stable conditions after undergoing health assessment
As Australia mourned the dead, thousands of people gathered at Martin Place to lay flowers, some in floods of tears. Among those paying tribute were Tony Abbott, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, Premier Mike Baird and the Governor General Peter Cosgrove.
Speaking earlier today, the prime minister said it was tragic people going about their everyday business could get caught up in such a horrific incident.
'Our hearts go out to all of those caught up in this appalling incident and their loved ones. On behalf of all Australians, I extend my sympathy to the families of the two hostages who died over night,' Mr Abbott said.
The 50-year-old gunman is believed to have fired the first shots, which sparked teams of heavily armed police to swoop on the cafe.
More details of the final terrifying moments of the siege have since emerged as tributes flow in for those who were involved.

A shrine for the hostage victims has grown rapidly since a single bunch of flowers was laid at dawn on Tuesday.
Dignitaries, workers from nearby offices and tourists have been seen paying their respects with some standing in solemn silence and others sobbing uncontrollably.
The law firm Ms Dawson worked for, which was located next door to Lindt, told Daily Mail Australia they were 'devastated by the loss of our beloved floor member'.
It said the 38-year-old was a rising star at 8 Selborne Chambers.
'Katrina was on her way to becoming one of the leading barristers at the bar. She was also a dear friend to all of us and will be deeply missed,' a statement read.
'Our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. We also send our condolences to everyone affected by this tragic event.
'We thank all those who have sent messages of support.'
Kate Golder, 37, broke down in tears as she paid tribute to the hostages.
'It's the randomness of it, it could have been any of the cafes that I frequent in the city, it could have been any of us,' she said.
'I said to my husband it could have been me - I feel so sorry for the victims and their families. Martin Place is such a lovely place to be but that peace has been shattered.'
Ms Golder works in the finance industry and her office is just 100 metres from the cafe.
'When i I walk through Martin Place now it will always feel different for me,' she said.
'Sydneysiders, like most Australians, we are pretty relaxed but it feels like something has changed overnight.'
Terri Lucia, who also works nearby, sobbed uncontrollably as she placed flowers at the makeshift shrine.
'Im really very shocked. As soon as I found out what happened to those poor people I had to come down just so they know that we care. It's just awful - I'm still in shock,' the 52-year-old said.
'It has changed forever, it's such a beautiful place.I used to come here and have lunch but it just doesn't feel like it today.'

The group that owns Sydney's Lindt cafe has pledged support for the victims of a hostage-taker, saying it's profoundly saddened by the deaths and injuries suffered.
Lindt & Sprungli chairman Ernst Tanner said the loss of two innocent lives at its Martin Place cafe was a heavy weight to bear.
The company has pledged support for the families of the dead, as well as the wounded and other survivors.
'Lindt & Sprungli is profoundly saddened and deeply affected about the death of innocent people,' Mr Tanner said in a statement on Tuesday.
'We are devastated by the loss of their lives and that several others were wounded and had to experience such trauma.'
'In these difficult times, we all need to stand together in order to defend the values of freedom, peace and tolerance,' he said.
The company pledged to support its workers and customers whose lives were shattered by a terrible and random act of violence.
'Lindt & Sprüngli will provide any support to the victims and their families, and indeed to all our employees affected by this event,' the company's Australian chief executive Stephen Loane said.

Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione paid his respects to the two innocent siege victims
Eleven hostages were accounted for after the police raid shortly after 2am. Five hostages had already escaped earlier on Monday afternoon.
NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said police entered the building after they heard gunfire and feared hostages had been hit.
'They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn't enter it would have been many more lives lost,' Mr Scipione said.
'I understand there was a number of gunshots that were heard, which caused officers to move straight to what we call an EA – emergency action plan – and that caused them to enter.'
A crime scene is still set up in and around the Lindt cafe as investigations continue.
The siege has prompted police to have a 24 hour presence in public places and transport hubs over the Christmas and New Year period.
Seven Network reporter Chris Reason, who was watching the siege unfold from his newsroom across the road, said some of the hostages broke free after Monis attempted to usher the hostages from one side of the café to the other.
One man emerged from the cafe with his hands up and lay down on the ground in front of police. Seconds later, a group of at least five hostages escaped from the cafe.
It is believed that Monis then fired his shotgun, killing one of his captives. This appeared to be the trigger for tactical police to move in.
Within seconds, they had blasted through the cafe door and opened fire with automatic weapons, also hurling what appeared to be stun grenades. The sounds of explosions echoed through the city and the flashes of rifle fire and grenades lit up the area.
The gunfight lasted less than two minutes and more hostages emerged after the police raid. As the scene calmed down, a bomb disposal robot was seen entering the cafe.

Heavily armed police remained posted around the cafe as night fell and the hostage drama continued into the night. Inside, the remaining hostages were brought food and were observed by witnesses as looking 'pained'
The hostages were seized by the gunman on Monday morning after he stormed the Sydney cafe. Several captives made an early courageous break for freedom but it was thought that about 15 hostages remained in the cafe through the night.
During the stand-off with police, three videos were released on YouTube, believed to be of three female hostages putting the gunman's demands to police. Those demands included the police bringing an ISIS flag to the cafe and insisting on a conversation with Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
The gunman's name was released soon after midnight after senior police gave their approval to various media outlets.
The drama began unfolding Monday morning when the gunman entered the cafe, located in one of busiest plazas in Sydney's central business district, and pulled a shotgun from a blue carry bag and disabled the doors.
Soon afterwards, hostages were seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the Islamic Shahada flag. It is an emblem of extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria. The man was described as wearing a headband with Arabic writing on it.
Scores of police rushed to the scene, evacuating surrounding buildings and closing off part of the city. The scene sent shockwaves across Australia, where terror attacks have rarely touched home soil.
Paramilitary police armed with automatic rifles spent Monday surrounding the cafe, with senior commanders saying they were prepared to take a patient approach to the siege, hoping to end it through negotiation with the gunman.

A total of five hostages, including barista Elly Chen, managed to escape the cafe by scrambling out a side door about seven hours into the drama. Fear etched on their faces, they ran into the arms of waiting police.
It is understood the hostages escaped from the cafe, rather than being released by their captor. One former male hostage was taken to nearby St Vincent's Hospital, in Sydney's inner suburbs, and was treated for a pre-existing condition.
The gunman flew into a rage when he realised some of his captives had escaped.
'The gunman could be seen from here getting extremely agitated, shouting at remaining hostages,' tweeted journalist Chris Reason.
The light inside the building went off through the night but police would not reveal whether it was a law enforcement or hostage-taker tactic. Mr Reason said he could see the gunman rotating the hostages through positions in the store's window.
'From inside Martin Place we can see the faces of hostages - pained, strained, eyes red and raw,' he recounted.
Food and water was also being delivered to the prisoners from the cafe's back kitchens.

Sydney was eerily quiet on Monday night.
Office buildings went into lockdown earlier on Monday morning, Martin Place train station - a central thoroughfare for workers - was shut. Events at the Opera House, such as a performance of the Nutcracker, were cancelled.
Hundreds of heavily armed police, operating under unprecedented Task Force Pioneer counter-terrorism protocols, were scouring the city, completely isolating the darkened cafe.
The man responsible is self-proclaimed Islamic cleric, who lives in southwest Sydney after coming to Australia from Iran as a refugee in 1996.
He first came to the attention of authorities when he started sending hate mail to the families of Australian dead soldiers between 2007 and 2009, according to The Daily Telegraph.
The siege in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place on Monday reportedly followed an unsuccessful effort to have a conviction related to penning those letters overturned in the High Court on Friday, according to The Age.
Man Haron Monis - also known as Sheik Haron - has been named as the gunman holding up to 15 people hostage in a Sydney café
Monis received 300 community service hours and a two-year good behaviour bond for the correspondence, which he claims were his version of sympathy cards and sent with the help from his girlfriend Amirah Droudis.
The hostage-taker was charged as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife - who was allegedly stabbed and set on fire on a flight of stairs in her western Sydney apartment block in November 2013. The man's current partner was charged with murder but they both received bail as the case was deemed too weak.
He was arrested in April this year for the sexual assault of a 27-year-old woman in 2002 after luring her to his clinic following claims he was as an expert in astrology, meditation and black magic, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Monis was slapped with an additional 40 charges in October after more victims came forward alleging incidents took place in his spiritual healing clinic in Station Street in Wentworthville, western Sydney.
High-profile Sydney Muslim leader Jamal Rifi told Daily Mail Australia he knew of the gunman but not on a personal level.
'What he expressed did not reflect the Muslim community which is why he is not part of the larger Muslim community and that's why he does not belong to a mainstream mosque,' he said.

On Monday morning, columnist Chris Kenny, who was in the shop about 20 minutes before the siege began, said he understood the automatic glass sliding doors had been disabled after the gunman stormed the store.
'I did speak to a couple of people who saw a bit more of this unfold than I did,' he said. 'One woman said she tried to go into the shop just after I came out with my takeaway coffee but the doors wouldn't open.
'So obviously whoever is doing this has disabled the automatic glass sliding doors to stop anyone else going in and she said immediately she could see there was a weapon.
'The woman was quite frantic but very clear what she was telling (the police).
'I know the faces of the people who are sitting there enjoying a morning coffee.'
2GB radio host Ray Hadley said he had three tense telephone conversations with one of the hostages inside the cafe and he could hear the gunman giving demands.
The hostage asked to be put to air live following the instructions of the gunman. However, Hadley refused saying he didn't have the expertise to deal with the situation.
'There are some people who are not well. They've been in there for five hours, they're distraught,' he said.
'I'm not in a position to comply with requests that have been made, I can't.
'The media can't play a role in negotiating with people purporting to be from Islamic State holding hostages in a cafe in Sydney. This is the job of authorities to solve htis problem.

A Lindt cafe employee, who was due to start her shift just an hour after the Sydney hostage drama unfolded, said she was 'shaking with fear' when the gunman arrived.
Kathryn Chee, a chocolatier at the cafe said she meant to turn up early for her 11am shift because the business had been so busy in the lead up to Christmas.
'It shakes me to the bone,' Ms Chee told the ABC. She said her colleagues who are now hostages are 'people who I hold like another family'.
'It's good I'm not there but I wish I could be there for them. That could be me standing there.'
Ms Chee said the young woman seen in footage holding an Islamic flag pressed against the window had 'a look of sheer horror on her face'.

Even the city's courts, including the venerable Downing Centre building, were sealed for the day, with police quickly vacating the areas.
Rosemary Healion, who works at Frederick Jordan Chambers, told Daily Mail Australia on Monday morning that 'a couple hundred' of her colleagues were inside at the time of the attack.
'My colleagues are still in there. They're trying to get them out now,' Ms Healion told Daily Mail Australia.
Ms Healion said her office was on the ground floor, the same one as Lindt and they had been pushed behind the office's reception area.

WHAT IS THE SHAHADA FLAG? Held up to a window by terrified hostages, a black flag covered in white Arabic was the first sign that the Martin Place siege could be linked to extremist Islam. Witnesses initially believed that it was the standard of ISIS. However, close examination revealed it was in fact the Shahada flag, bearing the words 'There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah' It is used by the extremist group, Jabhat al Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria. But it has meaning for all Muslims, in that the Shahada is the Islamic Creed, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which is recited by Muslims when they pray. The flag displayed at the Lindt cafe
Window cleaner, David Wilson, managed to get a birds-eye-view of police swarming into Martin Place as he and a colleague cleaned the windows of a building across from Lindt.
'We were looking around and there were cops running around and guns drawn. Some people came out, they looked like just coffee drinkers and that was about all we saw,' Mr Wilson said, adding that his colleague's first response was to get out his phone and start filming.
Rodrigo Neryt was arriving at Channel Seven for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the cafe.
'I was at the corner when everything started. I saw people yelling and screaming and two police cars arriving at the scene. I saw what looked like a black ISIS flag and they were holding it up'
John Edwards works across the road from the cafe on the ninth floor of 53 Martin Place.
He said every floor of the building had been cleared about 11.15am.
'We were evacuated out of the building from the basement,' Mr Edwards told Daily Mail Australia.
'All we were told by security was to get out.'
Lindt Australia issued a statement about the siege on its Facebook page.
'We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,' they said.
Earlier this year, it was reported that Martin Place was the planned location of a terror plot. It was alleged in September that Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old Sydney man arrested on terrorism charges, was planning a public beheading there.
The alleged terror plot, mentioned in a conversation between now deceased Australian terrorism recruiter in Syria, Mohammad Ali Barylei and Azari, involved selecting a member of the public at random, beheading them and then covering their body in a flag.
The whole incident was going to be filmed, and then used as propaganda for the Islamic State cause. Federal prosecutors said the alleged terror plot was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'
Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that Azari had made a threat which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute' during a telephone conversation with Baryalei.
Azari was arrested on September 18 and charged with preparing for an act of terrorism.
He is due in court this week for a bail application.

Tori Johnson, the manager of the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were the two hostages killed during the bloody climax.
Mr Johnson, 34, was shot dead after he tried to wrestle the gun from Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis inside the cafe just after 2am on Tuesday.
Ms Dawson, a 38-year-old whose children are all under 10, died in hospital. She was a barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers in Sydney's Phillip Street, opposite the site of the siege.
The remaining hostages were able to make a break for the exit of the cafe about 2am after the gunman began to fall asleep - more than 16 hours after he took 17 people captive.

Ms Dawson, who leaves behind her husband Paul and their children, Chloe, Sasha and Olive, was having a coffee with a pregnant colleague when the siege unfolded. Her children were unaware she was involved until Tuesday morning, the Australian reports.
One of the pregnant women in the cafe at the time, Julie Taylor, was also a colleague of Ms Dawson and had to be treated in hospital following the ordeal.
Lawyer Stefan Balafoutis was one of the first three men to escape the cafe about 3.45pm. He works in the 10th Floor Selborne/Wentworth Chambers, which is directly above Lindt.
Dressed in a bright blue blazer, 83-year-old John O’Brian, was the first out of the cafe when he escaped with Mr Balafoutis.
Marcia Mikhail, 42, was among those hostages forced to record a chilling video message listing the hostage-taker's demands. She was carried out of the cafe by two emergency services workers with blood running down her leg and is still recovering in hospital.
Harriett Denny, a fellow employee, ran from the cafe with five other hostages shortly before police issued their gunfire assault. The 30-year-old's father who lives in Queensland was forced to watch the horrific incident unfold on TV.
Viswakanth Ankireddy, a software engineer at tech giant Infosys, was working for Westpac in Martin Place when he was caught up in the siege. His Westpac colleague, Puspendu Ghosh, also escaped the siege unharmed.
Jarrod Hoffman, 19, and Fiona Ma were also among the hostages, the Daily Telegraph reports.
Selina Win Pe escaped unharmed after she was also forced to relay demands via a recorded message that were subsequently posted online during the siege.
Joel Herat, who lists his workplace as ‘Lindt & Sprüngli’ on Facebook, was another of the hostages to upload a haunting hostage clip on his YouTube account.
Within half an hour, the video was taken down by YouTube and the account was deactivated.
Paolo Vassallo, who was among the first hostages to escape on Monday afternoon, is a married father of three. After escaping, Vassallo was taken to hospital due to a pre-existing medical condition. He was later reunited with his family, reports ABC.

Visibily distraught men and women have been laying tributes for the two innocent victims of the siege
Ken and Rosemary, the parents of Mr Johnson, who was shot inside the cafe he had run for two years, released a statement on Tuesday.
'We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for.
'We'd like to thank not only our friends and loved ones for their support, but the people of Sydney; Australia and those around the world for reaching out with their thoughts and prayers.'
They also expressed their sorrow for the family of Katrina Dawson who also died.
The siege ended after less than two minutes of gunfire at 2.15am today. Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson died from their injuries, while several others were wounded:
Five hostages were injured in the shootout which left the gunman dead
Three women suffered gunshot wounds - a 75-year-old who was hit in the shoulder, a 52-year-old in the foot and a 43-year-old in the leg
A police officer was injured by gunshot pellets to his face. He has now been released from hospital
Two pregnant women, aged 35 and 30, are both in stable conditions after undergoing health assessment
As Australia mourned the dead, thousands of people gathered at Martin Place to lay flowers, some in floods of tears. Among those paying tribute were Tony Abbott, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, Premier Mike Baird and the Governor General Peter Cosgrove.
Speaking earlier today, the prime minister said it was tragic people going about their everyday business could get caught up in such a horrific incident.
'Our hearts go out to all of those caught up in this appalling incident and their loved ones. On behalf of all Australians, I extend my sympathy to the families of the two hostages who died over night,' Mr Abbott said.
The 50-year-old gunman is believed to have fired the first shots, which sparked teams of heavily armed police to swoop on the cafe.
More details of the final terrifying moments of the siege have since emerged as tributes flow in for those who were involved.

A shrine for the hostage victims has grown rapidly since a single bunch of flowers was laid at dawn on Tuesday.
Dignitaries, workers from nearby offices and tourists have been seen paying their respects with some standing in solemn silence and others sobbing uncontrollably.
The law firm Ms Dawson worked for, which was located next door to Lindt, told Daily Mail Australia they were 'devastated by the loss of our beloved floor member'.
It said the 38-year-old was a rising star at 8 Selborne Chambers.
'Katrina was on her way to becoming one of the leading barristers at the bar. She was also a dear friend to all of us and will be deeply missed,' a statement read.
'Our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. We also send our condolences to everyone affected by this tragic event.
'We thank all those who have sent messages of support.'
Kate Golder, 37, broke down in tears as she paid tribute to the hostages.
'It's the randomness of it, it could have been any of the cafes that I frequent in the city, it could have been any of us,' she said.
'I said to my husband it could have been me - I feel so sorry for the victims and their families. Martin Place is such a lovely place to be but that peace has been shattered.'
Ms Golder works in the finance industry and her office is just 100 metres from the cafe.
'When i I walk through Martin Place now it will always feel different for me,' she said.
'Sydneysiders, like most Australians, we are pretty relaxed but it feels like something has changed overnight.'
Terri Lucia, who also works nearby, sobbed uncontrollably as she placed flowers at the makeshift shrine.
'Im really very shocked. As soon as I found out what happened to those poor people I had to come down just so they know that we care. It's just awful - I'm still in shock,' the 52-year-old said.
'It has changed forever, it's such a beautiful place.I used to come here and have lunch but it just doesn't feel like it today.'

The group that owns Sydney's Lindt cafe has pledged support for the victims of a hostage-taker, saying it's profoundly saddened by the deaths and injuries suffered.
Lindt & Sprungli chairman Ernst Tanner said the loss of two innocent lives at its Martin Place cafe was a heavy weight to bear.
The company has pledged support for the families of the dead, as well as the wounded and other survivors.
'Lindt & Sprungli is profoundly saddened and deeply affected about the death of innocent people,' Mr Tanner said in a statement on Tuesday.
'We are devastated by the loss of their lives and that several others were wounded and had to experience such trauma.'
'In these difficult times, we all need to stand together in order to defend the values of freedom, peace and tolerance,' he said.
The company pledged to support its workers and customers whose lives were shattered by a terrible and random act of violence.
'Lindt & Sprüngli will provide any support to the victims and their families, and indeed to all our employees affected by this event,' the company's Australian chief executive Stephen Loane said.

Eleven hostages were accounted for after the police raid shortly after 2am. Five hostages had already escaped earlier on Monday afternoon.
NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said police entered the building after they heard gunfire and feared hostages had been hit.
'They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn't enter it would have been many more lives lost,' Mr Scipione said.
'I understand there was a number of gunshots that were heard, which caused officers to move straight to what we call an EA – emergency action plan – and that caused them to enter.'
A crime scene is still set up in and around the Lindt cafe as investigations continue.
The siege has prompted police to have a 24 hour presence in public places and transport hubs over the Christmas and New Year period.
Seven Network reporter Chris Reason, who was watching the siege unfold from his newsroom across the road, said some of the hostages broke free after Monis attempted to usher the hostages from one side of the café to the other.
One man emerged from the cafe with his hands up and lay down on the ground in front of police. Seconds later, a group of at least five hostages escaped from the cafe.
It is believed that Monis then fired his shotgun, killing one of his captives. This appeared to be the trigger for tactical police to move in.
Within seconds, they had blasted through the cafe door and opened fire with automatic weapons, also hurling what appeared to be stun grenades. The sounds of explosions echoed through the city and the flashes of rifle fire and grenades lit up the area.
The gunfight lasted less than two minutes and more hostages emerged after the police raid. As the scene calmed down, a bomb disposal robot was seen entering the cafe.

Heavily armed police remained posted around the cafe as night fell and the hostage drama continued into the night. Inside, the remaining hostages were brought food and were observed by witnesses as looking 'pained'
The hostages were seized by the gunman on Monday morning after he stormed the Sydney cafe. Several captives made an early courageous break for freedom but it was thought that about 15 hostages remained in the cafe through the night.
During the stand-off with police, three videos were released on YouTube, believed to be of three female hostages putting the gunman's demands to police. Those demands included the police bringing an ISIS flag to the cafe and insisting on a conversation with Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
The gunman's name was released soon after midnight after senior police gave their approval to various media outlets.
The drama began unfolding Monday morning when the gunman entered the cafe, located in one of busiest plazas in Sydney's central business district, and pulled a shotgun from a blue carry bag and disabled the doors.
Soon afterwards, hostages were seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the Islamic Shahada flag. It is an emblem of extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria. The man was described as wearing a headband with Arabic writing on it.
Scores of police rushed to the scene, evacuating surrounding buildings and closing off part of the city. The scene sent shockwaves across Australia, where terror attacks have rarely touched home soil.
Paramilitary police armed with automatic rifles spent Monday surrounding the cafe, with senior commanders saying they were prepared to take a patient approach to the siege, hoping to end it through negotiation with the gunman.

A total of five hostages, including barista Elly Chen, managed to escape the cafe by scrambling out a side door about seven hours into the drama. Fear etched on their faces, they ran into the arms of waiting police.
It is understood the hostages escaped from the cafe, rather than being released by their captor. One former male hostage was taken to nearby St Vincent's Hospital, in Sydney's inner suburbs, and was treated for a pre-existing condition.
The gunman flew into a rage when he realised some of his captives had escaped.
'The gunman could be seen from here getting extremely agitated, shouting at remaining hostages,' tweeted journalist Chris Reason.
The light inside the building went off through the night but police would not reveal whether it was a law enforcement or hostage-taker tactic. Mr Reason said he could see the gunman rotating the hostages through positions in the store's window.
'From inside Martin Place we can see the faces of hostages - pained, strained, eyes red and raw,' he recounted.
Food and water was also being delivered to the prisoners from the cafe's back kitchens.

Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said overnight that police would do whatever it takes for the situation to be peacefully resolved.
Sydney was eerily quiet on Monday night.
Office buildings went into lockdown earlier on Monday morning, Martin Place train station - a central thoroughfare for workers - was shut. Events at the Opera House, such as a performance of the Nutcracker, were cancelled.
Hundreds of heavily armed police, operating under unprecedented Task Force Pioneer counter-terrorism protocols, were scouring the city, completely isolating the darkened cafe.
The man responsible is self-proclaimed Islamic cleric, who lives in southwest Sydney after coming to Australia from Iran as a refugee in 1996.
He first came to the attention of authorities when he started sending hate mail to the families of Australian dead soldiers between 2007 and 2009, according to The Daily Telegraph.
The siege in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place on Monday reportedly followed an unsuccessful effort to have a conviction related to penning those letters overturned in the High Court on Friday, according to The Age.
Man Haron Monis - also known as Sheik Haron - has been named as the gunman holding up to 15 people hostage in a Sydney café
Monis received 300 community service hours and a two-year good behaviour bond for the correspondence, which he claims were his version of sympathy cards and sent with the help from his girlfriend Amirah Droudis.
The hostage-taker was charged as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife - who was allegedly stabbed and set on fire on a flight of stairs in her western Sydney apartment block in November 2013. The man's current partner was charged with murder but they both received bail as the case was deemed too weak.
He was arrested in April this year for the sexual assault of a 27-year-old woman in 2002 after luring her to his clinic following claims he was as an expert in astrology, meditation and black magic, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Monis was slapped with an additional 40 charges in October after more victims came forward alleging incidents took place in his spiritual healing clinic in Station Street in Wentworthville, western Sydney.
High-profile Sydney Muslim leader Jamal Rifi told Daily Mail Australia he knew of the gunman but not on a personal level.
'What he expressed did not reflect the Muslim community which is why he is not part of the larger Muslim community and that's why he does not belong to a mainstream mosque,' he said.

The hostage asked to be put to air live following the instructions of the gunman. However, Hadley refused saying he didn't have the expertise to deal with the situation.

But it has meaning for all Muslims, in that the Shahada is the Islamic Creed, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which is recited by Muslims when they pray. The flag displayed at the Lindt cafe
Window cleaner, David Wilson, managed to get a birds-eye-view of police swarming into Martin Place as he and a colleague cleaned the windows of a building across from Lindt.
'We were looking around and there were cops running around and guns drawn. Some people came out, they looked like just coffee drinkers and that was about all we saw,' Mr Wilson said, adding that his colleague's first response was to get out his phone and start filming.
Rodrigo Neryt was arriving at Channel Seven for his first day of work experience when he heard screaming out the front of the cafe.
'I was at the corner when everything started. I saw people yelling and screaming and two police cars arriving at the scene. I saw what looked like a black ISIS flag and they were holding it up'
John Edwards works across the road from the cafe on the ninth floor of 53 Martin Place.
He said every floor of the building had been cleared about 11.15am.
'We were evacuated out of the building from the basement,' Mr Edwards told Daily Mail Australia.
'All we were told by security was to get out.'
Lindt Australia issued a statement about the siege on its Facebook page.
'We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,' they said.
Earlier this year, it was reported that Martin Place was the planned location of a terror plot. It was alleged in September that Omarjan Azari, the 22-year-old Sydney man arrested on terrorism charges, was planning a public beheading there.
The alleged terror plot, mentioned in a conversation between now deceased Australian terrorism recruiter in Syria, Mohammad Ali Barylei and Azari, involved selecting a member of the public at random, beheading them and then covering their body in a flag.
The whole incident was going to be filmed, and then used as propaganda for the Islamic State cause. Federal prosecutors said the alleged terror plot was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'
Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that Azari had made a threat which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute' during a telephone conversation with Baryalei.
Azari was arrested on September 18 and charged with preparing for an act of terrorism.
He is due in court this week for a bail application.

And now, for the first time in CNN/ORC polling, his gains among the Republican Party have boosted him enough to be competitive in the general election.
But Clinton still holds the cards overall in the race for the White House, leading four Republican contenders: She tops Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by 6 points each among registered voters, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush by 9 points, and businesswoman Carly Fiorina by 10 points.

Clinton maintains this edge in the general election race despite a growing perception that by using a personal email account and server while serving as secretary of state she did something wrong. About 56% say so in the new poll, up from 51% in March. About 4-in-10 (39%) now say she did not do anything wrong by using personal email. Among Democrats, the share saying she did not do anything wrong has dipped from 71% in March to 63% now, and just 37% of independents say she did not do wrong by using the personal email system.
And positive impressions of Clinton continue to fade. Among all adults, the new poll finds 44% hold a favorable view of her, 53% an unfavorable one, her most negative favorability rating since March 2001. A majority of women voters have a positive take on Clinton, 52% view her favorably, and her support among women appears to be the foundation for her general election advantages.
But the fading numbers haven't hurt her against some GOP contenders. Clinton has her biggest lead over Fiorina, topping her 53% to 43% among registered voters. She leads Bush by a nearly identical margin, 52% to 43%. And Clinton tops both Trump (51% to 45%) and Walker (52% to 46%) by 6 points each.
All of those leads are boosted by sizable gender gaps.
Against Bush, Clinton leads 59% to 37% among women, while Bush holds an advantage among men, 51% Bush to 44% Clinton. Against Fiorina, the only woman among the major candidates for the Republican Party's presidential nominations, women break 60% for Clinton to 39% for Fiorina, while men are about evenly divided, 48% for Fiorina, 46% for Clinton. The largest gender gap -- 34 points -- comes in a match-up between Clinton and Trump. Women favor Clinton by 23 points, 60% to 37%, while men break in Trump's favor by 11 points, 53% to 42%.
At the same time, Clinton's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president is narrowing, and the new poll suggests the best way for the former secretary of state to shift the momentum would be for Vice President Joe Biden to decide to sit this one out. Most Democrats, though, say they'd like to see Biden make a run for the White House.
Overall, 47% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they support Clinton for the party's nomination. That's down 9 points since July, and marks the first time her support has dipped below 50% in national CNN/ORC polling on the race.
And though support for Clinton's nomination bid has slipped, she is the candidate most trusted by Democrats on four top issues, and remains the candidate to beat in general election match-ups.
Should Biden decide not to make a run for the presidency, his supporters would largely flock to Clinton rather than Sanders, boosting her numbers. With Biden's backers re-allocated to their second choice, Clinton holds 56%, Sanders 33%, with support for O'Malley, Webb and Chafee unchanged.
Among those Democratic voters who are ""extremely enthusiastic"" about voting for president next year, it's already essentially a two-person race. Clinton is the choice of 50% of such voters, with Sanders jumping to 38% among that group, Biden at 6%, and O'Malley at 2%.
Still, most Democrats say they do want Biden to make a go of it: 53% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden should run, 45% that he should stay out. Even among those who currently support Clinton, 50% say they think Biden should run.
Democratic voters aren't necessarily convinced a Biden presidency would be better than a Clinton one, though: 35% say Biden would do a worse job as president than Clinton, 27% a better one and 38% say there wouldn't be any difference between the two. Those who think Biden should run are more apt to say he'd do a better job than a worse one (41% better vs. 18% worse) but a sizable 41% say there ultimately wouldn't be any difference between the two.
Fewer see Sanders as equivalent to Clinton, more say he'd do a worse job. Overall, 37% of Democratic voters think Sanders would do a worse job as president than Clinton, 31% that he'd do a better job, and 29% that there would be no difference between the two. That shifts among the party's liberal voters, 41% of whom think Sanders would do a better job than Clinton, 34% think he would do worse than Clinton and 22% that there would be no difference.
Sanders has boosted his favorability rating in the last month, 35% of adults and 58% of Democratic voters have a positive impression of the senator, that's up from 23% among adults and 36% among Democratic voters since July.
When Democratic voters are asked which candidate they trust to handle the economy, race relations, foreign policy and the income gap between rich and poor Americans, Clinton tops the list each time. Her biggest advantage comes on foreign policy, where 61% of registered Democrats say they trust Clinton over the rest of the field. Biden follows at 22%, and just 9% say Sanders is their top choice here. On the economy, 45% say Clinton would best handle it, 26% choose Sanders and 21% Biden.

That shifts among the party's liberal voters, 41% of whom think Sanders would do a better job than Clinton, 34% think he would do worse than Clinton and 22% that there would be no difference.
Sanders has boosted his favorability rating in the last month, 35% of adults and 58% of Democratic voters have a positive impression of the senator, that's up from 23% among adults and 36% among Democratic voters since July.
When Democratic voters are asked which candidate they trust to handle the economy, race relations, foreign policy and the income gap between rich and poor Americans, Clinton tops the list each time. Her biggest advantage comes on foreign policy, where 61% of registered Democrats say they trust Clinton over the rest of the field. Biden follows at 22%, and just 9% say Sanders is their top choice here. On the economy, 45% say Clinton would best handle it, 26% choose Sanders and 21% Biden.

Sanders fares best on the income gap, with 34% saying he would do the best job handling that issue, 7 points behind Clinton's 41%. Though the margin is wider among those with incomes under $50,000 annually, 49% of Democratic voters in that group favor Clinton to handle the income gap, 28% Sanders.
On race relations, an issue that both top Democrats have addressed directly in interactions with Black Lives Matter activists in recent weeks, Clinton tops Sanders by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, 50% choose her while 26% say they trust Sanders most, 14% Biden.

The sample included 897 registered voters, 358 of whom are registered voters who are Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party.

Clinton stands at 45% in the race for the Democratic nomination, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders behind her at 29%. Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a run for presidency and did not participate in last week's debate, follows at 18%.
Behind the top three, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb had 1% support, while former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, Harvard professor Larry Lessig and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley all held less than 1% support.
Compared with pre-debate polling, Sanders' support is up five points since mid-September, but no other candidate showed significant change.
As Biden mulls whether or not to get in the race, the poll suggests Democrats are becoming less enamored of a run from the vice president. In August, 53% of registered Democrats said they wanted Biden to run, that's down to 47% in the new poll. Should Biden decide to sit out the race for the Democratic nomination, Clinton's lead over Sanders climbs to 23 points: 56% would back Clinton, 33% Sanders.

Overall, 31% of registered Democrats say they watched all or most of the CNN/Facebook debate, held October 13 in Las Vegas. More than 6-in-10 Democrats who watched say Clinton did the best job, almost doubling the 35% who thought Sanders had the best performance. On the other side of the coin, 43% of those who watched said Chafee had the worst night, 31% thought Webb did, 12% O'Malley.
Among those Democrats who watched the debate, both Sanders and Biden are viewed more favorably than they are among Democratic voters generally: Sanders' favorability number bumps from 62% among all Democratic voters to 84% among debate viewers, while Biden climbs from 76% to 89% favorable. Clinton's numbers are about the same in both groups.
Despite their positive feelings toward Biden, debate-watchers are more apt than others to say Biden should stay out of the contest (61% think he should not run, compared with 43% of those who did not watch) and they are far more likely to be satisfied with the Democratic field generally (84% compared with 64% among those who didn't watch).
Assessing the lesser-known candidates, debate-watchers are more positive than other Democrats toward O'Malley, (44% favorable compared with 20% among Democratic voters generally). But Webb and Chafee are both viewed more negatively among those who watched (For Chafee, 32% unfavorable among debate-watchers vs. 18% among all Democratic voters; Webb is at 37% unfavorable among debate-watchers, 20% among all Democratic voters).
Following the debate, Clinton continues to dominate as the more trusted candidate across several top issues, with double-digit advantages over Sanders and Biden as the candidate who would best handle the economy, health care, foreign policy, race relations, climate change and gun policy. Clinton also now holds a small edge over Sanders as most trusted on income inequality (43% Clinton, 38% Sanders).
Debate-watchers are more likely than others to say they trust Sanders on top issues, though even among this more-friendly audience, he continues to trail Clinton on most issues. Exceptions are income inequality (50% of debate-watchers trust Sanders vs. 36% for Clinton) and climate change (40% each say Clinton and Sanders would be best able to handle that).
Sanders gained no ground, however, on foreign policy. On that question, Clinton's strength grows among those who watched: 77% in that group say they trust her most to handle foreign policy, up from 66% among Democratic voters overall.
On two issues where the debate highlighted differences among the candidates, fissures within the Democratic electorate on who would best handle them emerge.
Income inequality appears to be the most divisive issue, with women, older voters, those without college degrees, moderates and those with lower incomes more apt to trust Clinton on the issue, while those with college degrees, liberals, and urbanites are more likely to favor Sanders.
And on gun policy, there's a sharp gender divide. Women are far more likely to say they trust Clinton to handle it than men, 50% to 37%. Democratic gun owners are more evenly split on the question, with 35% saying they trust Clinton most on gun policy, 27% Sanders and 21% Biden. Among those Democrats who do not own guns, it's 48% Clinton, 21% Biden and 16% Sanders.

Overall, Democrats aren't much more satisfied with their field now than they were in July before any debates had happened. While the share ""very satisfied"" has risen from 26% to 33%, the share saying they are at least fairly satisfied has held steady at about 7-in-10. Women do report feeling more satisfied with the field than men, but younger Democrats, a key group for Barack Obama's general election victories, are far less satisfied with this field of candidates than older Democrats. Only about one-quarter of those under age 50 say they are very satisfied, compared with 40% of those age 50 or older.
When matched against the top candidates from the Republican field, Clinton, Sanders and Biden all top Donald Trump, who has been leading most polling on the Republican nomination contest since this summer. But Biden is the only one who holds a significant lead over Ben Carson, a more recent addition to the top of the Republican field. Trump trails Clinton by 5, Sanders by 9 and Biden by 10.

Charlie Hebdo attackers holed up in print shop
The day's drama began in Dammartin-en-Goele, where brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi ended up in a print shop in an industrial area.
A salesman, who identified himself only as Didier, told France Info radio that he shook one of the gunman's hands at about 8:30 a.m. as they arrived at the business. Didier said he first thought the man, who was dressed in black and heavily armed, was a police officer.
As he left, the armed man said, ""Go, we don't kill civilians."" Didier said, ""It wasn't normal. I did not know what was going on.""

Word came that the brothers were dead and that a man who had been hiding in the building was safe, said Bernard Corneille, the mayor of nearby Othis.
Hostages at kosher grocery store
At the same time, in a different setting near Paris's Porte de Vincennes about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, a similar crisis played out at a kosher store.
Amedy Coulibaly -- the same man who, authorities said, is suspected with Hayat Boumeddiene of killing a policewoman Thursday south of Paris -- on Friday took a number of hostages there. Boumeddiene remains at large.
Like Cherif Kouachi, a man claiming to be Coulibaly called BFMTV on Friday. At the scene, witnesses heard Coulibaly demand freedom for the Kouachi brothers, according to police union spokesman Pascal Disand.

Law enforcement swarmed the area. Dozens of schools went on lockdown.
A resolution came a few minutes after the Dammartin-en-Goele climax, in the form of explosions and gunfire. Up to 20 heavily armed police officers moved into the store. They came out with a number of civilians.
Not everyone made it. Hollande said four people were killed. Israeli government sources told CNN that Hollande told Netanyahu that four hostages were killed and 15 were rescued. Molins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market.
Father: 'It's like a war'
In a speech Friday night, Hollande called the Porte de Vincennes deaths an ""anti-Semitic"" act.
He urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against Muslims, saying, ""Those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the Muslim religion.""
""Unity"" he said, ""is our best weapon.""
Map: Standoffs near Paris, France
That kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days.
It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son.
And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety.
""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son.""
Parts of France on high alert
This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else.
They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them. The dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names: Cabu, Wolinski, Honore and Tignous.

Authorities followed a lead Thursday morning from a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Dammartin-en-Goele, whom Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas. Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods.
Ties to Islamist extremists
As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still.
Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers.
Both men had ties to Islamist extremists.
Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack.
Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials.
His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans.""
""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis.""
Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN.
A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike.
Cherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter.
The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together.

At many companies, people spend around 80% of their time in meetings or answering colleagues’ requests, leaving little time for all the critical work they must complete on their own. What’s more, research the authors have done across more than 300 organizations shows that the apportionment of collaborative work is often extremely lopsided.

Idea in Brief The Situation Over the past two decades, the amount of time managers and employees spend on collaborative work has ballooned. At many companies people now spend about 80% of their time in meetings or answering colleagues’ requests. The Problem Although the benefits of collaboration are well documented, the costs often go unrecognized. When demands for collaboration run too high or aren’t spread evenly through the organization, workflow bottlenecks and employee burnout result. The Solution Leaders must learn to better manage collaboration in their companies by mapping supply and demand, eliminating or redistributing work, and incentivizing people to collaborate more efficiently.
Collaboration is taking over the workplace. As business becomes increasingly global and cross-functional, silos are breaking down, connectivity is increasing, and teamwork is seen as a key to organizational success. According to data we have collected over the past two decades, the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50% or more.
Certainly, we find much to applaud in these developments. However, when consumption of a valuable resource spikes that dramatically, it should also give us pause. Consider a typical week in your own organization. How much time do people spend in meetings, on the phone, and responding to e-mails? At many companies the proportion hovers around 80%, leaving employees little time for all the critical work they must complete on their own. Performance suffers as they are buried under an avalanche of requests for input or advice, access to resources, or attendance at a meeting. They take assignments home, and soon, according to a large body of evidence on stress, burnout and turnover become real risks.
Just for Subscribers In Demand, Yet Disengaged Leadership & Managing people Visual
What’s more, research we’ve done across more than 300 organizations shows that the distribution of collaborative work is often extremely lopsided. In most cases, 20% to 35% of value-added collaborations come from only 3% to 5% of employees. As people become known for being both capable and willing to help, they are drawn into projects and roles of growing importance. Their giving mindset and desire to help others quickly enhances their performance and reputation. As a recent study led by Ning Li, of the University of Iowa, shows, a single “extra miler”—an employee who frequently contributes beyond the scope of his or her role—can drive team performance more than all the other members combined.
But this “escalating citizenship,” as the University of Oklahoma professor Mark Bolino calls it, only further fuels the demands placed on top collaborators. We find that what starts as a virtuous cycle soon turns vicious. Soon helpful employees become institutional bottlenecks: Work doesn’t progress until they’ve weighed in. Worse, they are so overtaxed that they’re no longer personally effective. And more often than not, the volume and diversity of work they do to benefit others goes unnoticed, because the requests are coming from other units, varied offices, or even multiple companies. In fact, when we use network analysis to identify the strongest collaborators in organizations, leaders are typically surprised by at least half the names on their lists. In our quest to reap the rewards of collaboration, we have inadvertently created open markets for it without recognizing the costs. What can leaders do to manage these demands more effectively?
Precious Personal Resources
First, it’s important to distinguish among the three types of “collaborative resources” that individual employees invest in others to create value: informational, social, and personal. Informational resources are knowledge and skills—expertise that can be recorded and passed on. Social resources involve one’s awareness, access, and position in a network, which can be used to help colleagues better collaborate with one another. Personal resources include one’s own time and energy.
These three resource types are not equally efficient. Informational and social resources can be shared—often in a single exchange—without depleting the collaborator’s supply. That is, when I offer you knowledge or network awareness, I also retain it for my own use. But an individual employee’s time and energy are finite, so each request to participate in or approve decisions for a project leaves less available for that person’s own work.
Up to a third of value-added collaborations come from only 3% to 5% of employees.
Unfortunately, personal resources are often the default demand when people want to collaborate. Instead of asking for specific informational or social resources—or better yet, searching in existing repositories such as reports or knowledge libraries—people ask for hands-on assistance they may not even need. An exchange that might have taken five minutes or less turns into a 30-minute calendar invite that strains personal resources on both sides of the request.
Consider a case study from a blue-chip professional services firm. When we helped the organization map the demands facing a group of its key employees, we found that the top collaborator—let’s call him Vernell—had 95 connections based on incoming requests. But only 18% of the requesters said they needed more personal access to him to achieve their business goals; the rest were content with the informational and social resources he was providing. The second most connected person was Sharon, with 89 people in her network, but her situation was markedly different, and more dangerous, because 40% of them wanted more time with her—a significantly greater draw on her personal resources.
We find that as the percentage of requesters seeking more access moves beyond about 25, it hinders the performance of both the individual and the group and becomes a strong predictor of voluntary turnover. As well-regarded collaborators are overloaded with demands, they may find that no good deed goes unpunished.
The exhibit “In Demand, Yet Disengaged,” reflecting data on business unit line leaders across a sample of 20 organizations, illustrates the problem. People at the top center and right of the chart—that is, those seen as the best sources of information and in highest demand as collaborators in their companies—have the lowest engagement and career satisfaction scores, as represented by the size of their bubbles. Our research shows that this ultimately results in their either leaving their organizations (taking valuable knowledge and network resources with them) or staying and spreading their growing apathy to their colleagues.

Leaders can solve this problem in two ways: by streamlining and redistributing responsibilities for collaboration and by rewarding effective contributions.
Redistributing the Work
Any effort to increase your organization’s collaborative efficiency should start with an understanding of the existing supply and demand. Employee surveys, electronic communications tracking, and internal systems such as 360-degree feedback and CRM programs can provide valuable data on the volume, type, origin, and destination of requests, as can more in-depth network analyses and tools. For example, Do.com monitors calendars and provides daily and weekly reports to both individual employees and managers about time spent in meetings versus on solo work. The idea is to identify the people most at risk for collaborative overload. Once that’s been done, you can focus on three levers:
Encourage behavioral change.
Show the most active and overburdened helpers how to filter and prioritize requests; give them permission to say no (or to allocate only half the time requested); and encourage them to make an introduction to someone else when the request doesn’t draw on their own unique contributions. The latest version of the team-collaboration software Basecamp now offers a notification “snooze button” that encourages employees to set stronger boundaries around their incoming information flow. It’s also worth suggesting that when they do invest personal resources, it be in value-added activities that they find energizing rather than exhausting. In studying employees at one Fortune 500 technology company, we found that although 60% wanted to spend less time responding to ad hoc collaboration requests, 40% wanted to spend more time training, coaching, and mentoring. After their contributions were shifted to those activities, employees were less prone to stress and disengagement.
To stem the tide of incoming requests, help seekers, too, must change their behavior. Resetting norms regarding when and how to initiate e-mail requests or meeting invitations can free up a great deal of wasted time. As a step in this direction, managers at Dropbox eliminated all recurring meetings for a two-week period. That forced employees to reassess the necessity of those gatherings and, after the hiatus, helped them become more vigilant about their calendars and making sure each meeting had an owner and an agenda. Rebecca Hinds and Bob Sutton, of Stanford, found that although the company tripled the number of employees at its headquarters over the next two years, its meetings were shorter and more productive.
In addition, requests for time-sapping reviews and approvals can be reduced in many risk-averse cultures by encouraging people to take courageous action on decisions they should be making themselves, rather than constantly checking with leaders or stakeholders.
Leverage technology and physical space to make informational and social resources more accessible and transparent.
Relevant technical tools include Slack and Salesforce.com’s Chatter, with their open discussion threads on various work topics; and Syndio and VoloMetrix (recently acquired by Microsoft), which help individuals assess networks and make informed decisions about collaborative activities. Also rethink desk or office placement. A study led by the Boston University assistant professor Stine Grodal documented the detrimental effects of team meetings and e-mails on the development and maintenance of productive helping relationships. When possible, managers should colocate highly interdependent employees to facilitate brief and impromptu face-to-face collaborations, resulting in a more efficient exchange of resources.
Consider structural changes.
Can you shift decision rights to more-appropriate people in the network? It may seem obvious that support staff or lower-level managers should be authorized to approve small capital expenditures, travel, and some HR activities, but in many organizations they aren’t. Also consider whether you can create a buffer against demands for collaboration. Many hospitals now assign each unit or floor a nurse preceptor, who has no patient care responsibilities and is therefore available to respond to requests as they emerge. The result, according to research that one of us (Adam Grant) conducted with David Hofmann and Zhike Lei, is fewer bottlenecks and quicker connections between nurses and the right experts. Other types of organizations might also benefit from designating “utility players”—which could lessen demand for the busiest employees—and possibly rotating the role among team members while freeing up personal resources by reducing people’s workloads.
Rewarding Effective Collaboration
We typically see an overlap of only about 50% between the top collaborative contributors in an organization and those employees deemed to be the top performers. As we’ve explained, many helpers underperform because they’re overwhelmed; that’s why managers should aim to redistribute work. But we also find that roughly 20% of organizational “stars” don’t help; they hit their numbers (and earn kudos for it) but don’t amplify the success of their colleagues. In these cases, as the former Goldman Sachs and GE chief learning officer Steve Kerr once wrote, leaders are hoping for A (collaboration) while rewarding B (individual achievement). They must instead learn how to spot and reward people who do both.
Why Women Bear More of the Burden The lion’s share of collaborative work tends to fall on women. They’re stereotyped as communal and caring, so they’re expected to help others with heavy workloads, provide mentoring and training to more-junior colleagues, recruit new hires, and attend optional meetings. As a result, the evidence shows, women experience greater emotional exhaustion than men. One important solution to this problem is to encourage women to invest different types of resources in collaboration. In a 2013 Huffington Post poll of Americans, men and women estimated how often they contribute to others in a variety of ways. Men were 36% more likely to share knowledge and expertise—an informational resource. Meanwhile, women were 66% more likely to assist others in need—an action that typically costs more time and energy. By making contributions that rely less on personal resources, women can protect themselves against collaboration overload. Managers must also ensure that men and women get equal credit for collaboration. In an experiment led by the NYU psychologist Madeline Heilman, a man who stayed late to help colleagues earned 14% higher ratings than a woman who did the same. When neither helped, the woman was rated 12% lower than the man. By improving systems for measuring, recognizing, and rewarding collaborative contributions, leaders can shift the focus away from the gender of the employee and toward the value added.
Consider professional basketball, hockey, and soccer teams. They don’t just measure goals; they also track assists. Organizations should do the same, using tools such as network analysis, peer recognition programs, and value-added performance metrics. We helped one life sciences company use these tools to assess its workforce during a multibillion-dollar acquisition. Because the deal involved consolidating facilities around the world and relocating many employees, management was worried about losing talent. A well-known consultancy had recommended retention bonuses for leaders. But this approach failed to consider those very influential employees deep in the acquired company who had broad impact but no formal authority. Network analytics allowed the company to pinpoint those people and distribute bonuses more fairly.
Efficient sharing of informational, social, and personal resources should also be a prerequisite for positive reviews, promotions, and pay raises. At one investment bank, employees’ annual performance reviews include feedback from a diverse group of colleagues, and only those people who are rated as strong collaborators (that is, able to cross-sell and provide unique customer value to transactions) are considered for the best promotions, bonuses, and retention plans. Corning, the glass and ceramics manufacturer, uses similar metrics to decide which of its scientists and engineers will be named fellows—a high honor that guarantees a job and a lab for life. One criterion is to be the first author on a patent that generates at least $100 million in revenue. But another is whether the candidate has worked as a supporting author on colleagues’ patents. Corning grants status and power to those who strike a healthy balance between individual accomplishment and collaborative contribution. (Disclosure: Adam Grant has done consulting work for Corning.)
Collaboration is indeed the answer to many of today’s most pressing business challenges. But more isn’t always better. Leaders must learn to recognize, promote, and efficiently distribute the right kinds of collaborative work, or their teams and top talent will bear the costs of too much demand for too little supply. In fact, we believe that the time may have come for organizations to hire chief collaboration officers. By creating a senior executive position dedicated to collaboration, leaders can send a clear signal about the importance of managing teamwork thoughtfully and provide the resources necessary to do it effectively. That might reduce the odds that the whole becomes far less than the sum of its parts.",17527

Video shows gunman target seemingly wounded man
These developments come after at least two heavily armed men entered the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris' 11th district, close to Place de la Bastille, and opened fire, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.
Map: Charlie Hebdo HQ, Paris
The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" Molins said.
A witness who works in the office opposite the magazine's told BFMTV that he saw two hooded men, dressed in black, enter the building heavily armed.
""We then heard them open fire inside, with many shots,"" he said. ""We were all evacuated to the roof. After several minutes, the men fled, after having continued firing in the middle of the street.""
The men reportedly spoke fluent French with no accent.
One unsettling video, posted to YouTube, shows two men shooting on a Paris street, then walking up to and firing point-blank at a seemingly wounded man as he lay on the ground.
Video shows a gunman approaching his getaway car and raising his finger in the air in what appears to be a signal, possibly to another vehicle or other people who might have played a role in the attack, a Western intelligence source briefed on the French investigation told CNN.
In addition to the 12 dead , 11 people were wounded, including four in ""serious condition,"" the prosecutor said. Two police officers were among those killed, the French President said.

Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, known as ""Charb,"" is among the dead in the attack, a police spokesman in the district where the office is located told CNN. At least three other well-known cartoonists -- known by the pen names Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous -- were also killed.
'Parisians will not be afraid'
At an event in Paris' Place de la Republique, demonstrators held up pens in honor of the slain cartoonists and chanted, ""We are Charlie!"" Pictures posted online showed similar demonstrations in other cities, including Rome, Berlin and Barcelona.
""Parisians will not be afraid,"" Klugman said. ""We will fight terrorism with our common values, freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. ... We are at war, but we still want to behave as a leading democracy.""
Armed soldiers could be seen standing guard outside monuments, in transit stations and elsewhere in well-trafficked spots around France by Wednesday evening.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls raised France's security to its highest level -- ""attack alert"" -- after the Charlie Hebdo bloodshed. That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement.
U.S. counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups, including ISIS and al Qaeda, that might be responsible for the attack. Charlie Hebdo has been singled out as a target for Islamist extremists in al Qaeda's publication, Inspire.
Police impounded a black Citroen in northeastern Paris similar to the one purportedly used by the attackers as a getaway car. Video from CNN affiliate BFMTV shows the vehicle being towed from Porte de Pantin, in Paris' 19th district.
Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN.
The same source said that French authorities are searching all travel records from the past 17 days to see whether any of the attackers entered the European nation over the holidays. This includes checks at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as whatever limited information is available from train stations.
Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said. He asked for a moment of reflection Thursday and said flags will be at half-staff for three days.
Satirical magazine has drawn anger
Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects, including Christianity. But what it's done on Islam has gotten the most attention and garnered the most vitriol.
Its last tweet before Wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The magazine has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world
JUST WATCHED Killed cartoon editor in 2012: 'Disarm them with humor' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Killed cartoon editor in 2012: 'Disarm them with humor' 00:35
Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago.
In November 2011, Charlie Hebdo's office was firebombed the day it was due to publish a cover making fun of Islamic law.
A year later, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, Charbonnier gave little indication that he planned to change Charlie Hebdo's ways.
""It may sound pompous,"" he said, ""but I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.""
The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.

Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects, including Christianity. But what it's done on Islam has gotten the most attention and garnered the most vitriol.
Its last tweet before Wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The magazine has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world

Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago.
In November 2011, Charlie Hebdo's office was firebombed the day it was due to publish a cover making fun of Islamic law.
A year later, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, Charbonnier gave little indication that he planned to change Charlie Hebdo's ways.
""It may sound pompous,"" he said, ""but I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.""
The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.

618804516578680832,false,Family: @Schwarzenegger's last act as governor stole justice from dead son. http://t.co/kqNPETEsMS http://t.co/83VpjEX6to,http://cnn.it/1JTYDt9,True,Arnold Schwarzenegger's last act as governor follows him,"(CNN) In Hollywood, there's no better magnet for stargazing than a movie premiere. So on a Sunday afternoon in late June, the summer sun couldn't keep thousands of fans from lining Hollywood Boulevard, hoping to spot a star.
This was the ""Terminator Genisys"" premiere , and only one star mattered: Arnold Schwarzenegger . The former governor of California shook hands, signed autographs and posed for selfies. It's the kind of personal attention Fred and Kathy Santos wish they could get from Schwarzenegger , who they say stole justice from their dead son.
""He plays a hero in the movies, yet in real life he's not a hero,"" Fred Santos said. ""He's a dirty politician.""
Minutes before ending his two terms as governor, Schwarzenegger issued his final act: Commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez, the teen who pleaded guilty to stabbing to death the Santos' son, Luis, in 2008.
It's not that a governor issuing clemency was anything new. But neither the Santos family nor San Diego County prosecutors had any idea it was coming, let alone got a chance to plead their case. Instead, they were informed by a news release and a phone call from a reporter.
""My son (was) stabbed in the heart when he was alive,"" Fred Santos told CNN. ""Schwarzenegger stabbed him in the back after my son is killed.""
At first, Fred Santos asked himself why the governor would care about their case. But deep down he knew. Santos feared political influence from the beginning -- ever since learning that Esteban Nunez wasn't just any accused killer.
He was the son of Fabian Nunez, California's most powerful Democrat and a political ally to the governor. So to many, such as San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, Schwarzenegger's surprise commutation appeared as if Nunez was cashing in.
""I think it was political cronyism at its worst.""
The speaker's son, a brutal crime
When Fabian Nunez was sworn in as speaker of the California Assembly in 2004, his son was by his side. At 15, Esteban Nunez appeared baby-faced and shy -- nothing like the muscular, tattooed adult described in court records just four years later.
It was October 2008, and prosecutors alleged that Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were fueling their anger with alcohol. They had just been denied entry to a fraternity party near the campus of San Diego State University (neither were students there), and they were looking for revenge. The Sacramento natives were going to show them how it was done ""in Sac town,"" the pair boasted, according to court records.
""They decided they were going to either burn a frat house or they were going to stab some people,"" Dumanis said.
Armed with knives, they walked the streets at 2 a.m. until they encountered Luis Santos and a friend. After an initial altercation, Luis called several more friends who ran to his aid.
""It was a melee basically, where two of the boys were stabbed. One went into an induced coma,"" Dumanis said. ""Luis was stabbed, and one got smashed in the eye.""
""My boy's dying, my boy's dying,"" Luis' friend screamed to a 911 dispatcher.
""Stay awake Luis, stay awake,"" another friend sobbed.
A knife pierced the left ventricle of Luis' heart. He died at the scene.
Later that same night, Nunez, Jett and two others piled into a car and headed north to Sacramento. Surveillance video at a 7-Eleven captured Jett and Nunez leaving the store with a Big Gulp cup. They filled it with $1.30 worth of gasoline and used it to burn their weapons and bloody clothes, throwing the items into the Sacramento River and agreeing to never speak of the incident.
But witnesses helped police identify four suspects, and two of them weren't so quiet. The pair fingered Nunez and Jett as the stabbers, later getting probation in exchange for their testimony.
Two months after getting a phone call that their son was dead, the phone rang again at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. Their son's alleged killers were behind bars, and a reporter had a question: What was their reaction to the son of Fabian Nunez being arrested for Luis' murder?
""My concern was that politics might interfere with justice in the legal system,"" Fred Santos told CNN.
Though assured the system would not bend to politics, Santos says he grew up in Asia, where ""politicians are dirty.""
""I asked if the judge was a Democrat,"" he said, believing Fabian Nunez's power in that party would influence the case.
The judge was a Republican. In time, however, the judge would become the least of Santos' worries.
Foes to friends
By the time Esteban Nunez was charged with murder, his father had already derailed Arnold Schwarzenegger's early years in office. The Republican governor tried to bypass Nunez and the Democrats by calling for too many special elections on pet projects, with failing results.
""I got to tell you, things are very sloppy here on the first floor,"" Nunez once told reporters, referring to the governor's office.
Schwarzenegger returned the jab in private conversations that were recorded and later released to news organizations.
""Fabian is too much a political operator,"" he told his staff, apparently unaware of the recording. ""Not so much passion about specific things he stands for.""
But with his policies stalling in Sacramento, Schwarzenegger announced a shift in strategy in a State of the State address, conceding his mistakes and pledging to work with Nunez and the Democrats. The tactic proved beneficial for both sides. The pair stood side-by-side when California passed legislation creating the highest minimum wage in the nation, one of many victories out of a newly minted political friendship.
In 2008, though, Schwarzenegger did not publicly get involved in Nunez's personal problems. Instead, with his son facing a first degree murder charge and fighting for a lower bail amount, Fabian Nunez called on his Democratic friends to vouch for the credibility of his son. A union leader, a retired assemblyman and even then-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa submitted letters to the judge.
On official mayoral stationery, Villaraigosa wrote that Esteban had shared meals at his home and that he was ""a young man of good and upright character.""
""They already have the mayor trying to influence the judge,"" Fred Santos said. ""Nobody in power was speaking (for us). We're just regular folks.""
The deal
In 2010, Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were moments away from their murder trial. A first degree conviction would result in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. A second degree conviction, 15 to life.
But then, with jury selection already underway, came the next twist in this case: a plea deal for Nunez and Jett. If the pair pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, they would face a maximum of 16 years behind bars. For the Santos family it sounded too brief, but would offer swift justice and an end to years of future pain.
""So we will not be spending the rest of our lives going to court ... listening to them fight their appeal if they were convicted,"" Fred Santos said.
For District Attorney Dumanis, a plea bargain also removed, in her mind, the only impediment to an otherwise airtight case: proving who actually stabbed Luis.
Witness testimony pointed to Jett as Luis' killer, while Nunez stabbed two other boys who survived. Was that enough to pin first- or second-degree murder on Esteban Nunez? The question no longer needed an answer when all sides agreed to a deal. Nunez and Jett pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.
""I couldn't believe we were giving this case away,"" said Rick Clabby, then deputy district attorney, in an interview with CNN.
Now retired, Clabby believes the evidence was strong enough for at least a second-degree murder conviction.
""We charged Nunez with conspiracy, too,"" Clabby said. ""It didn't matter if the jury couldn't decide who was the stabber.""
But Dumanis stressed the emotional toll on the victims and approved the deal.
As part of the plea, Nunez admitted that his actions led to the death of Luis Santos. Both Nunez and Jett were sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison.
Calling it ""bitter satisfaction,"" the Santoses thought their son's newly confessed killers would go away quietly and pay for their crimes, content with the plea deal they had just reached.
""Had I known what was going to happen,"" said Dumanis, ""that (deal) never would have been an agreement.""
The governor's final act
On January 2, 2011, six months after their son's convicted killers were sent to prison, the phone rang at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos. It was another reporter.
""That's been the story of our life, a reporter calls the house and gives me information,"" said Kathy Santos.
This time, she was told of the surprise commutation and immediately went online for more information.
""There was Esteban's face,"" she said, ""with a little blurb about Arnold's dirty deed.""
Minutes before leaving office, Schwarzenegger announced the commutation in an emailed news release. Esteban Nunez's sentence had been cut in half. He would be eligible for release in April of 2016.
""I was so disgusted,"" Kathy Santos said. ""Esteban has been coddled, he hasn't had to be accountable because apparently his father has gotten him off.""
Fabian Nunez has publicly denied he forced Schwarzenegger into granting a favor, but he also wasn't complaining. Nunez has repeatedly maintained that his son got a raw deal because he was related to a powerful lawmaker.
""From the beginning, my son was the headliner in the case,"" Nunez told CNN affiliate KCRA in 2011. He declined CNN's repeated requests for an interview, but after an initial version of this story aired on television, Nunez spoke to CNN over the phone.
""This has gone from aiding and abetting to him being labeled a killer,"" Nunez said of his son.
He argues that comments from the Santos family, their attorneys and the district attorney's office have boiled the case down to a convenient narrative: Esteban Nunez accepted a plea deal, then had it cut in half because of the influence of his father. In reality, Fabian Nunez told CNN, ""the case is more complicated,"" and that his son sought clemency to right wrongs perpetrated on them by an ""overzealous district attorney"" and a ""conservative judge.""
""My son did not want to take the deal"" if it meant he had to accept 16 years behind bars, Nunez said. ""He was going to go to trial"" and defend his position that Esteban was not nearly the aggressor that the prosecution was making him out to be.
""This was a fight among a large group"" of people, Fabian Nunez said, adding that the two suspects who were given probation in exchange for their testimony ""were just as responsible as my son.""
In a letter to the court objecting to the sentence, Fabian Nunez claims the judge overreached in giving Esteban the full 16 years because his son, unlike Jett, ""had no criminal record"" and that Esteban ""did not harm Mr. Santos,"" referring to the witness who claimed Jett inflicted the fatal blow.
Fabian Nunez went on to claim his son was misled by the judge, who ""told us that (he) would treat Esteban differently"" from Jett.
""He told the attorney one thing in chambers, then went into open court and said another,"" Fabian Nunez told CNN.
Prosecutors maintain they warned Esteban in open court that he could receive 16 years.
The judge denied that he made conflicting statements and refused to reconsider the sentence.
Esteban Nunez and his attorneys continued their fight until December 6, when they submitted a motion to end their appeal.
Less than a month later, Nunez received clemency.
""I believe Nunez's sentence is excessive,"" wrote Schwarzenegger in his commutation letter, citing the lack of criminal history and the inability to prove that Nunez actually stabbed Luis Santos.
""It was a complete betrayal of a system of justice and fairness,"" said Dumanis, the district attorney, who questions whether Nunez even submitted a clemency application to the governor. Nunez's attorney, Charles Sevilla, told CNN he did but refused to release it.
Upon his exit, Schwarzenegger ordered all clemency files sealed for 25 years. (That's not necessarily unusual. Schwarzenegger's predecessor, Gray Davis, did the same thing.)
In his only comment about the case, Schwarzenegger told Newsweek, ""There's criticism out there. I think it's just because of our (Fabian Nunez) working relationship and all that. It maybe was kind of saying, 'That's why he did it.' Well, hello! I mean, of course you help a friend.""
Fabian Nunez told CNN he was told by Schwarzenegger that the comments were ""taken out of context."" Still, the Santos family attorney, Nina Solarno, was outraged.
""He took a political favor and played God, and took justice away from this family,"" claimed Solarno, who is also a board member for the advocacy group Crime Victims United.
In a private letter to the Santos family, Schwarzenegger wrote: ""I recognize that the last minute nature of my final acts as Governor provided you no notice, no time to prepare for or absorb the impact of this decision. For that, I apologize.""
It was an apology the Santos family would not accept.
Taking on the Terminator
While Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to Hollywood in 2011, Fred and Kathy Santos returned to court. Along with the San Diego County district attorney, they filed suit alleging Gov. Schwarzenegger violated ""Marsy's Law,"" which mandates that victims' families be given a right to speak in all proceedings related to their case.
It was the last chance Dumanis had to keep Esteban Nunez behind bars and repair the damage from what she considered a tremor shaking the entire system.
""When a governor commutes a sentence in such a flagrantly political way, it puts everybody in the system on notice that their (deals) are not safe,"" Dumanis said.
While agreeing Schwarzenegger's move was ""grossly unjust"" and ""deserving of censure,"" two separate judges concluded that it was not illegal and that ""Marsy's Law"" applied to parole hearings, not executive clemency.
Schwarzenegger, for now, had won. But both the Santoses and San Diego prosecutors were not giving up.
They succeeded in changing the state law, which now requires California governors to give victims and prosecutors at least 10 days of notice before issuing clemency. That will ensure Luis Santos' case isn't repeated, but it won't keep Esteban Nunez from being released.
While the Santos family will next petition the state Supreme Court, they know time is running out.
""Esteban is going to be out before we get to the Supreme Court,"" Solarno conceded. ""Now we want an acknowledgment that the family's rights were taken from them, that they should have been heard, and that from this day forward your case is setting precedent that other victims are going to be heard.""
Arnold Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN's requests for a formal interview, but when questioned by CNN at the ""Terminator Genysis"" premiere in June, he would not speak about the case.
""Since we're here today for the movie promotion, we talk movies,"" he said.
""That's the type of person he is,"" said Fred Santos. ""He thinks somebody being murdered -- it's news that is below his status.""

For Rick Clabby, the vocal former prosecutor, the Santos family has been victimized too many times in this case.
""They were victimized when their son was murdered, they were victimized when our office made this stupid decision and they were victimized when the governor buddied up with Mr. Nunez,"" Clabby told CNN.

""The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty,"" Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO's director-general, told her organization's executive board members. ""We need to get some answers quickly.""
The lack of any immunity to Zika and the fact that mosquitoes spreading the virus can be found most ""everywhere in the Americas"" -- from Argentina to the southern United States -- explains the speed of its transmission, said Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, an official with the WHO and Pan American Health Organization.
Aldighieri gave the estimate for Zika infections (including people who do not report clinical symptoms) based on data regarding the spread of a different mosquito-borne virus -- dengue. He acknowledged the virus is circulating with ""very high intensity.""
Some 80% of those infected with the Zika virus don't even feel sick, and most who do have relatively mild symptoms such as a fever, rash, joint pain or pink eye. But there are major worries about the dangers pregnant women and their babies face.
Chan said that, where the virus has arrived, there's been a corresponding ""steep increase in the birth of babies with abnormally small heads and in cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome ."" Having small heads can cause severe developmental issues and sometimes death. Guillain-Barre is a rare autoimmune disorder that can lead to life-threatening paralysis.
The WHO's Dr. Bruce Aylward cautioned there was no definitive link between Zika and these disorders but sees a legitimate reason for concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Dr. Anne Schuchat said there is a ""strong"" suggestion they are connected.
While studies are underway to determine any links, millions of people live in areas with real fears about what this virus can do.
Pregnant women, their babies at high risk
After first being detected in 1947 in a monkey in Uganda, Zika was most often found along the equator from Africa into Asia. Nine years ago, new cases popped up in islands in the Pacific Ocean.
Last year, the virus made its way to the Americas -- with devastating results.
Since Brazil made its first discovery of Zika in May, the number of cases there and elsewhere in the Americas has grown exponentially. The virus had been thought to be relatively harmless over the long term, but that view changed late last year.
Health authorities began to suspect a connection between Zika and neurological ailments, especially in fetuses and newborns. Brazil alone has reported more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly -- a neurological disorder resulting in the births of babies with small heads -- in infants born to women infected with Zika while pregnant.
""Zika is not a new virus,"" the CDC's Schuchat said. ""But what we are seeing in the Americas is new.""

The mosquito-borne disease is in 23 countries and territories in the Americas, according to Chan.
There have been 32 documented cases in 12 states and the District of Columbia, though all of those people got infected in other countries. (There have been 19 laboratory-confirmed cases in Puerto Rico and one in the U.S. Virgin Islands.)
The states where Zika virus has been confirmed among travelers returning from affected countries are Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia, according to health departments.
Schuchat expects the number of travel-associated U.S. cases to rise and for people to contract the disease from mosquitoes here (though she downplayed widespread transmissions).
There will likely be more outside the United States as well.
""We expect more countries to be affected,"" Schuchat said.
WHO calls emergency meeting
Chan has called an emergency committee meeting Monday in Geneva, Switzerland, to address the Zika virus' spread and its ramifications.
The gathering will aim to determine the appropriate ""level of international concern,"" recommend measures for the most affected countries to take and assess Zika's possible association with neurological disorders, the WHO's Aylward said.
""There is a lot of uncertainty about some of the real basics about this disease,"" Aylward said from Geneva.
JUST WATCHED What is the Zika virus? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is the Zika virus? 01:32
U.S.-based researchers Daniel Lucey and Lawrence Gostin had called for just such a meeting this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, criticizing the WHO for not stepping up sooner.
""The very process of convening the committee would catalyze international attention, funding, and research,"" Lucey and Gostin wrote in an article published Wednesday. ""While Brazil, PAHO and the CDC have acted rapidly, WHO headquarters has thus far not been proactive, given potentially serious ramifications.""
After Chan's announcement about next week's meeting, Gostin urged the WHO leader to ""mobilize international resources to curb the rapid spread of Zika worldwide, including aggressive mosquito control, active surveillance, accelerated vaccine research and travel advisories for pregnant women.""
""It is far better,"" said the Georgetown University public health expert, ""to be overprepared than to wait until a Zika epidemic spins out of control.""
With no vaccine, controlling mosquitoes is key
No medicines are available to treat those with the Zika virus, and there are no vaccines to prevent it. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that clinical trials on a vaccine could begin this year.
The lack of treatment and preventive options has led officials in Colombia, Jamaica and El Salvador to advise women to avoid getting pregnant so long as the Zika threat remains. Eduardo Espinoza, El Salvador's vice minister of health, recommended that women should ""plan their pregnancies and try to avoid getting pregnant this year and the next.""
The WHO isn't going that far, nor does it plan to anytime soon, according to Aylward. The agency will more likely focus on advising women in the Americas who want to get pregnant to reduce their risk of mosquito bites. The United States is urging pregnant women not to fly to countries battling the virus.
Authorities are also focusing on containing the Aedes mosquito species, which spreads the disease. These mosquitoes have spread flaviviruses such as Zika before -- for example, dengue fever, in South America, Central America and as far north as Florida and Texas.
And the regularly occurring global weather phenomenon known as El Niño is expected to make things worse by increasing mosquito populations, the WHO's Chan said.
Keeping down the number of what Schuchat called ""aggressive daytime biters"" is tough. Microbiologist Brian Foy pointed out that Aedes mosquitoes ""can replicate in flower vases and other tiny sources of water.""
""Community mosquito control may be difficult,"" Schuchat said. ""The current methods that we have may have shortcomings.""
Canada requests certain blood donors wait
Canadian Blood Services, which manages most of Canada's supply of blood and blood products, is asking all potential donors who have traveled anywhere other than Canada, the United States or Europe to delay donating blood until one month after their return.
The agency said it is working with Health Canada and Héma-Québec to establish the length of time for delaying donations, but for now the recommendation is one month.
""The risk of Zika virus transmission from a Canadian donor to a blood recipient is very low. This deferral period is being introduced as a precaution, since to date, there has been no evidence of Zika virus transmission by transfusion causing illness in a recipient,"" the agency said in a statement.
The American Red Cross, the largest blood collection organization in the United States, said it is closely monitoring the virus but isn't taking a similar precaution, at least not yet.
""We are evaluating, as part of the AABB Transfusion Transmissible Disease committee, whether to ask donors to self-defer for 28 days following their return to the U.S. if they traveled to areas with ongoing Zika outbreaks,"" said Dr. Susan Stramer, vice president of scientific affairs at the American Red Cross.
She said that the Red Cross will continue to use safety measures to protect the blood supply from Zika virus as well as other mosquito-borne viruses.
Schuchat said the FDA is looking into blood supply issues for donors and travelers. The FDA regulates blood collection and manufacturing of blood products in the United States.",15235

25/25 Charlie Hebdo shooting Police officers and firefighters gather in front of the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, after armed gunmen stormed the offices leaving ""casualties"", according to the publication's cartoonist, and ""six seriously injured"" police officers according to City Hall
Police said that at least 10 of the killings took place in the initial attack inside the building, or died within minutes because of the seriousness of their injuries.
As the gunmen left in a black Citroën hatchback, they met with a police car which was part of the permanent protection given to the magazine after it was firebombed in 2011. The attackers got out of their vehicle and opened fire, killing two officers.
Video footage posted to social media showed armed gunmen running through the streets of Paris, shooting with automatic weapons and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". According to an eye-witness, one of the gunmen shouted: ""The Prophet is avenged.""

Paris has raised its terror alert to the highest setting in the aftermath of the attack, while a manhunt has begun for those involved. A social media post from France's AFP news agency reported that the men may also have been armed with at least one rocket-launcher, though this was not corroborated by other reports.
France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said police were looking for ""three criminals"", though it was not clear how many took part in the shooting itself. All resources had been mobilised, he said, ""to neutralise those who committed this barbaric act"".
A Charlie Hebdo cartoonist who survived the attack described how two ""hooded and armed men"" forced her to enter the code letting them into the magazine's offices.

The French President Francois Hollande has travelled to the scene in Paris's 11th arrondissement after what he called a ""terrorist attack of the most extreme barbarity"".
He said it was the latest in a series of terrorist incidents on French soil, and that the nation was in a state of shock.

""This is a difficult moment for France,"" Hollande told reporters. ""We have prevented several attacks. We knew that we were still under threat because we are a country that cherishes freedom.""
The urgent priority for officials on Wednesday afternoon remained tracking down those responsible. Paris police said the gunmen abandoned their car at the northern Porte de Patin and escaped.
Mr Cazeneuve said the attack had set in motion protective measures across ""all French territories"", including bolstered security at houses of worship, stores, media offices and transportation hubs.

Schools across the French capital closed their doors, while top government officials held a meeting of the national emergency committee. President Hollande has scheduled a national TV address to update the public on the situation later on Wednesday evening.
Police confirmed to French media that the dead included the magazine’s editor and chief cartoonist, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as ""Charb"", and Jean Cabut, or ""Cabu"", a veteran of several French newspapers and reportedly the highest paid cartoonist in the world.
According to a journalist at the scene, at least one of the police officers killed had been assigned to protect Mr Charbonnier personally. In 2013 he was included on a ""most wanted"" list published by Inspire, al-Qaeda's terrorist propaganda magazine.

Two other cartoonists, Georges Wolinski and Bernard Verlhac, or ""Tignous"", were also reported as having been killed.
Charb had previously defended a controversial series of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in 2012, saying: ""Muhammad isn't sacred to me. I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings. I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law.""
Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief Gerard Biard escaped the carnage because he was in London.

He told France Inter: ""I don't understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.""
Mr Biard said he did not believe the attack was linked to the magazine's latest front page, which featured novelist Michel Houellebecq. The writer's new novel ""Submission"", released in France on Wednesday, has caused controversy after it was described by critics as an ""Islamophobic scare story"".
Yet the magazine had not received any recent threats of violence, Mr Biard said: ""Not to my knowledge, and I don't think anyone had received them as individuals, because they would have talked about it. There was no particular tension at the moment.""

A year earlier, the magazine's offices were firebombed after a spoof issue featured a caricature of Mohammed on its cover. The edition ""invited"" Mohammed to be its guest editor.
According to one report, journalists were discussing a new Islam-themed edition on Wednesday when the gunmen burst in.
The latest post made by the Charlie Hebdo Twitter account was a picture of the Isis militant group leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper which sparked protests when it published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005, has increased its own security in the wake of the Paris shooting, France 24 reported. Charlie Hebdo re-published the same cartoons in 2006.

One witness to Wednesday's shooting, Gilles Boulanger, who works in the same building as the Charlie Hebdo offices, likened the scene to a war zone.
He told the BBC: ""A neighbour called to warn me that there were armed men in the building and that we had to shut all the doors.
""And several minutes later there were several shots heard in the building from automatic weapons firing in all directions.
""So then we looked out of the window and saw the shooting was on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, with the police. It was really upsetting. You'd think it was a war zone.""

Another witness, Benoit Bringer, told TV station France Info: ""We heard shouting in the street. We saw hooded men carrying Kalashnikovs enter the building. We called the police. After a few minutes we heard heavy firing, a lot of firing. We went upstairs onto the roof.
""After about 10 minutes we saw two armed men come out into the street. Three policemen arrived on bikes but had to leave because the men were armed. There was a lot more shouting in the street, a lot more gunshots. The attackers took off in a car.""
David Cameron led the British response to the unfolding incident, condemning the attack on Twitter.
""The murders in Paris are sickening,"" he posted. ""We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press.""
Philip Hammond, the British Foreign Secretary, wrote: ""Appalled to hear news of apparent terrorist attack in Paris. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those killed.""

A statement from the White House also condemned the attack ""in the strongest possible terms"". ""The US stands ready to work closely with the French,"" it said.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel called it an ""attack on freedom of speech"".
""This abominable act is not only an attack on the lives of French citizens and their security,"" a statement read. ""It is also an attack on freedom of speech and the press, core elements of our free democratic culture. In no way can this be justified.""
Pope Francis has also condemned the shooting. The Vatican said it was ""a double act of violence, abominable because it is both an attack against people as well as against freedom of the press"".
In a statement, the French journalists' union Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) said the attack represented attempts to ""silence"" the entire profession.
""The massacre perpetrated against the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo is a horror that strikes at us all. When journalists are killed, it is done to make an entire profession feel fear; it is done to silence. Attacking a newspaper is an attempt to muzzle the freedom of expression that exists in a democracy.""

One of Donald Trump’s top campaign strategists, former communications director Stephanie Cegielski, has resigned from his campaign in protest of Trump’s ridiculous statement that “only he can solve” the bombing in Pakistan (whatever that might mean). She has penned a devastating open letter to his supporters, explaining to us why she originally supported Trump, and how his excess and dishonesty turned her against him. She issues a stark warning to Trump supporters that the supposed “authenticity” of Trump is nothing but smoke and mirrors, a soap opera character – and that at the end of the day, Donald Trump only cares about himself. A brutal denunciation of Trump as both a candidate and a person, it might be the most complete evisceration of the orange-haired rabble-rouser yet written.
It will be interesting to see if Donald Trump’s supporters will be able to dismiss this evisceration so easily. They can’t cry “liberal media” or establishment bias – this comes from inside his own camp, the people who know him better than any of his supporters. It’s also a significant indication that Trump’s own advisers are becoming increasingly tired of his racist antics and his utter refusal to formulate any kind of substantial policy proposals. They recognize that he is utterly unprepared for the presidency and has no desire to change that.
An Open Letter to Trump Voters from His Top Strategist-Turned-Defector
Even Trump’s most trusted advisors didn’t expect him to fare this well. Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it. The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.
It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority. And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.
My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn’t look promising.
In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.
I was sold. Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC. It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.
After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.
That was inspiring to me. It wasn’t long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.
But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.
I don’t think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.
He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver’s seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy. A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, “Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.”
Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?
This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever. Superhero powers where “I alone can solve” problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.
What was once Trump’s desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.
I’ll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now. You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.
He doesn’t want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.
The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump. And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.
He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump’s voice. Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many “pieces of ass.” He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.
In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign’s internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency onThe West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet’s staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”
Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became “Let Trump Be Trump.”
It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogan is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.
Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought “Common Core” was a class at Equinox.
The primary problem with this? What I’ve seen the longer I’ve helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, “Let Trump Help Trump.”
I don’t dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it’s important to let you know that the candidate does.
I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.
The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.
I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.
I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his “build a wall” stump speech and talked about his greatness.
I felt sad for him at that moment.
And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.
I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.
He is not.
He even says so himself. His misogyny? That’s the character.
His presidential candidacy? That’s a character, too.
The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.
Trump made me believe. Until I woke up. And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.
I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump’s outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.
While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.
And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.
But something was shifting.
Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.
I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.
And here’s what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.
Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.
Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.
I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.
When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.
Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.
Trump acts as if he’s a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump isa work of fiction.
No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the “best” at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other “best” claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.
He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.
Don’t let our country pay that price.

Look back at his history on the tube https://t.co/19DTed49bu https://t.co/B06v9CZF3l,http://rol.st/20v2FQp,True,Elvis Presley on TV: 10 Unforgettable Broadcasts,"Although it's hard to believe in the context of today's media-saturated culture, Elvis Presley made only 17 major television appearances during the course of his lifetime. Together, they tell the King's story from his meteoric rise to his tragic downfall.
Related Elvis Presley's Albums to Comprise 60-Disc New Box Set 'Elvis Presley – The Album Collection' contains 57 albums and three discs of rarities, along with 300-page hardcover book
After making his national television debut 60 years ago, on January 28th, 1956, Presley shattered viewership records, challenged social mores and helped bring the rock & roll revolution into American living rooms. Even on the small screen, Elvis Presley was larger than life. These are his 10 most important broadcast moments.
January 28th, 1956: Stage Show
Though he had performed on the regional TV program Louisiana Hayride in March 1955, this spot on Stage Show was Elvis Presley's first national television appearance. Hosted by sibling big-band leaders Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, the show was broadcast live from CBS Studio 50 in New York — which also housed The Ed Sullivan Show.
The special aired just a day after his first major-label release, ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" and Presley was virtually unknown. The winter weather was particularly raw that night, so the future King of Rock made his American TV debut to a partly empty house. Clad in a stylish black shirt, white tie and tweed jacket, he performed Ray Charles' ""I Got a Woman"" and a medley of two Joe Turner songs, ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" and ""Flip, Flop and Fly.""
Two days later, Presley cut his quintessential cover of Carl Perkins' ""Blue Suede Shoes"" at New York's famed RCA Victor Studio 1. He would return to the Stage Show five more times before April.
June 5th, 1956: The Milton Berle Show
Presley's popularity was on the rise by the time he completed his final Stage Show set on March 24th, earning him a slot on the top-rated Milton Berle Show. His first appearance on April 3rd was broadcast live from the deck of the USS Hancock while naval personnel and their dates screamed in appreciation. Presley performed a short snippet of ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" before launching headlong into ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and ""Blue Suede Shoes."" He even acted in a comedy skit in which Uncle Miltie played his twin brother, Melvin. Considering that Presley spent most of his life haunted by the death of his actual twin brother at birth, the bit makes for uncomfortable viewing.
But none of this compares to his June 5th appearance, which would bring him widespread fame — and infamy. During prior television performances, Presley had played uptempo numbers with an acoustic guitar strapped to his body, severely limiting his ability to dance. But before Presley unveiled his cover of Big Mama Thornton's ""Hound Dog"" to TV audiences, Berle advised him to perform without the guitar. ""Let 'em see you, son,"" he reportedly said.
Indeed, 40 million American viewers saw him, and they were not prepared for Presley's unobscured pelvic thrusts. The episode horrified parents and press, delighted the youth, and made Elvis a star.
June 16th, 1956: Teenage Dance Party
Presley appeared on future game-show icon Wink Martindale's Teenage Dance Party to promote his July 4th charity show at Memphis' Russwood Park. In addition to performing, Elvis pledged to auction off his diamond-studded initials ring as a door prize at the event. Though he doesn't sing, the appearance is a unique chance to see Presley react to his first few months of stardom. He remained friendly with Martindale in the years to come, giving him a rare telephone interview while stationed in Germany during his military service. In an odd coda, Martindale went on to marry Presley's ex-girlfriend Sandy Ferra in 1975.
July 1st, 1956: The Steve Allen Show
In the wake of the firestorm sparked by Presley's ""obscene"" movements on Milton Berle four weeks earlier, Steve Allen took a unique approach when featuring his increasingly popular guest star. The original Tonight Show host stripped ""Hound Dog"" of any danger by having a tuxedo-clad Presley croon the tune to an actual basset hound. It's bizarre, it's awkward, and it has to be seen to be believed.
Ironically, Allen's attempt to avoid controversy just caused him further headaches. Presley was apparently furious with the host for putting him through the humiliating routine, and he swore to never do his show again. ""It was the most ridiculous appearance I ever did, and I regret ever doing it,"" he said in later years.
Many have since accused Allen, an avowed jazz fanatic with little interest in rock, with intentionally trying to belittle Presley with the song and other hokey sketches. Allen insisted this wasn't the case. Whatever the motivation, the episode's ratings were high enough to beat CBS' Sunday night juggernaut, The Ed Sullivan Show.
July 1st, 1956: Hy Gardner Calling
Immediately after his performance on The Steve Allen Show, Presley made his first and only live television talk-show appearance. He spoke with gossip columnist Hy Gardner, famed for interviewing celebrities via telephone and employing a then-novel split-screen technique. Although Gardner was something of a pioneer in television journalism, his questions are far from groundbreaking. Many address the slanderous rumors filling the press, including one ridiculous story about Presley shooting his own mother. The 21-year-old singer looks bored, if not completely exhausted, as he speaks from his suite at New York's Warwick Hotel. Perhaps it's unsurprising that this was Presley's last talk-show spot.
September 9th, 1956: The Ed Sullivan Show
Ed Sullivan initially deemed ""Elvis the Pelvis"" too hot for family viewing and refused to book him. But when Presley's July 1st spot on Steve Allen scored top ratings, Sullivan reconsidered his position. Offering Presley $50,000 for three appearances — 10 times what Allen had paid — TV's Sunday night king got his man and made history.
Presley's first appearance that September drew a record 60 million viewers, 82.6 percent of the national TV audience, making it the most-watched broadcast of the decade. Sullivan himself was recuperating from an automobile accident, so British actor Charles Laughton had the honor of introducing a very nervous ""Elvin"" Presley, live from Los Angeles where he was filming his first movie. He opened with ""Don't Be Cruel"" and ""Love Me Tender,"" before returning for a rowdier set later in the hour with Little Richard's ""Ready Teddy"" and ""Hound Dog.""
Contrary to popular belief, Presley was not shot from the waist up during this first Sullivan performance, or even during his second on October 28th. It was only after morally outraged crowds in Nashville and St. Louis began burning him in effigy that the censors intervened. Presley's third and final appearance on January 6th, 1957, was kept above the belt, thus shielding the God-fearing public from the sight of wiggling hips.
Despite the onscreen neutering, Sullivan had nothing but kind words for the 22-year-old from Tupelo. ""This is a real decent, fine boy,"" he told the crowd at the end of the show. ""We've never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than we've had with you. ... You're thoroughly all right.""
May 12th, 1960: The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis
Presley's two-year stint overseas with the Army left his American fans ravenous for their idol. His manager, Colonel Tom Parker, took full advantage of the demand by booking his client on Frank Sinatra's variety show for an exorbitant $125,000. It was a fortune for eight minutes of screen time, but producers couldn't pass up a chance to bring Presley to television for the first time since 1957, and to unite the biggest musical rivals of the Fifties.
The show began with an abbreviated appearance from Presley in his Army uniform, singing a portion of ""It's Nice to Go Trav'ling."" He returned later in the program to perform ""Fame and Fortune"" and ""Stuck on You,"" his first post-Army single, released days before. But the highlight of the night is the duet between the King and the Voice, with Sinatra singing lines from ""Love Me Tender"" while Presley trades lyrics from ""Witchcraft.""
Welcome Home Elvis was a major success, earning 41.5 percent of that night's television ratings. More importantly, the appearance with Sinatra re-introduced Presley to an older audience as an all-around entertainer rather than a disposable teen idol. For the next eight years, the formerly controversial rocker courted the mainstream with formulaic movies and increasingly bland musical offerings.
December 3rd, 1968: Elvis
The 1960s were not kind to Elvis Presley's image. He neglected his serious music career to appear in a string of third-rate movies with laughable scripts and dismal soundtrack songs, causing disappointed fans to scatter. By 1968, he was a cultural dinosaur in the eyes of the hip youth who worshipped artists like the Beatles. Being ""uncool"" was one thing, but when Colonel Tom Parker began having problems securing Presley's million-dollar movie fees, he knew something had to change.
He inked a deal with NBC to finance Presley's next movie (1969's Change of Habit) as well as an exclusive television broadcast, his first in more than eight years. The TV program was initially conceived as a throwaway Christmas special to satisfy the contract, but director Steve Binder saw an opportunity to salvage the singer's reputation and remind everyone why he was a star. Presley liked the idea: ""I want everyone to know what I can really do,"" he told NBC executives. He did exactly that.
Elvis (known forever after as ""the '68 Comeback Special"") was a triumph, mixing big-budget production numbers, intimate live band performances, a few socially conscious pleas for world peace and rump-shaking rock & roll. Though he hadn't performed live in more than seven years, Presley was in top form both vocally and physically. His leather getup harkened back to the young twentysomething who drove kids wild on Ed Sullivan a decade earlier. Now he ruled the stage with the supreme confidence of a grown man in total control. The King had returned for his crown.
The show was the highest-rated television special of the year, and provided a shot in the arm to Presley's floundering career. As a direct result of the production, he decided to refocus on music and the Memphis sound that he loved. Within weeks, he recorded ""Suspicious Minds,"" which reached number one that year. He soon began a series of record-breaking tours and Las Vegas residencies.
January 14th, 1973: Elvis: Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite
Richard Nixon's 1972 trip to China had a major impact on Presley, inspiring him to make some international history of his own. That summer, he announced plans to broadcast a concert via satellite, allowing the whole world to see him perform. It would be the first time a solo act ever attempted a live global transmission of this scale, and the $2.5 million price tag made it the most expensive entertainment special up to that point.
Presley chose a venue in Hawaii, a favorite vacation spot where he had already filmed three of his movies. More than a billion people reportedly tuned in from more than 40 countries across Europe and Asia to watch Presley perform a 22-song set. Amazingly, the U.S. initially did not air the special since it conflicted with Super Bowl VII. American fans would have to wait until April 4th to see what all the fuss was about.
The show crystalized what we now envision as latter-era Elvis Presley, complete with dramatic ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" intro and bold studded jumpsuits. The accompanying double album rose to the top of the charts, selling more than 5 million copies in the U.S. It would be the final Number One pop album of Elvis' lifetime.
October 3rd, 1977: Elvis in Concert
Released two months after Presley's death, Elvis in Concert is arguably his most controversial television appearance — not because of sexual potency, but because it's just so damn sad. The special shows a man who is clearly not well, bloated, glassy-eyed and fumbling through the lyrics of his hits. It also contains the last known footage of Presley ever filmed, receiving a gold record from RCA executives on June 26th, the day of his final concert.
The film is edited together from a June 19th concert in Omaha, Nebraska, and one that followed on June 21st in Rapid City, South Dakota. The performances were deemed so poor that CBS producers considered shelving them in favor of a future tour, but this was mooted after Presley was found dead on August 16th.
Fans and critics alike found the program difficult to watch, and challenged the ethics of broadcasting such a sorry spectacle. Elvis in Concert has never received a commercial release in any format, and it is likely to languish in the vaults indefinitely. Bootleg clips are available online, but they are no way to remember the King.",13001
692393375891361794,non-rumor,Check out new steps we're taking to expand access to meals for the kids who need it most: https://t.co/y4MhWLiLyY https://t.co/oQAcWxzPAk,http://go.wh.gov/SNAPworks,True,FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Announces Major Investments in Preventing Child Hunger,"Today, the White House will host a conversation about child hunger in America, with experts and direct service providers discussing how hunger continues to harm children across the country. Participants will discuss the role of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other core nutrition programs in ensuring American children have the fuel they need to thrive. The conversation will include SNAP recipients, academics, direct service providers, advocates, faith leaders, and federal, state, and local officials and will focus on the critical role of SNAP in reducing food insecurity and poverty, and the high-cost consequences when benefits are not enough to sustain a family to the end of the month. The agenda for today’s event is available HERE.
The Obama Administration is dedicated to ensuring American children and families have the support they need to build a better future, especially when weathering life’s ups and downs, such as loss of a job, illness, or work that pays less than a livable wage. SNAP and other nutrition programs, like school meals, make a real and measurable difference in the lives of children and their families and provide a stronger future for the entire country. Building on its commitment to expanding access to opportunity for all, today the Obama Administration will announce additional actions to ensure American children have the food they need to grow, learn, and succeed.
NEW FEDERAL ACTIONS
Ensuring all low-income children have year-round access to the food they need to learn and grow.
The President’s FY2017 Budget will invest $12 billion over ten years to reduce child hunger during the summer through a permanent Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) program to provide supplemental food benefits during the summer months for all families with children eligible for free and reduced price school meals. During the academic year, school meals help ensure consistent and adequate access to nutritious food for the nearly 22 million low-income children who receive free and reduced price school meals. However, only a fraction of these children receive free and reduced price meals when school is out of session. As a result, low-income children are at higher risk of food insecurity and poor nutrition during the summer. Summer EBT, which provides benefits on an electronic debit card that can only be used for food at the grocery store, fills the food budget gap in the summer; rigorous evaluations of USDA pilots of Summer EBT programs have found that they can significantly reduce food insecurity among children and improve their diet.
Allowing States to use Medicaid data to automatically link low-income children to school meals.
USDA will announce a new initiative to increase access to school meals for low-income children through a project that will allow interested State agencies that administer the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to use Medicaid data to certify students for free and reduced priced lunches. This will link eligible children to nutritious school meals with less paperwork for the State, schools and families alike. Interested states are invited to submit applications and USDA expects to approve approximately five States to begin the demonstrations during the upcoming school year (2016-2017), with additional states implementing the pilot in the subsequent years. USDA is committed to helping 20 States take up this pilot and begin implementing direct certification using Medicaid data over the next three school years.
BUILDING ON RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING SNAP’S CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED
In 2014, nearly one in seven American households experienced food insecurity, meaning that one or more household members did not have a consistent source of adequate nutritious food. Moreover, 40 percent of all food-insecure households—and nearly 6 percent of US households overall—were considered to have very low food security. This means that, in nearly seven million households, at least one person in the household missed meals and experienced disruptions in food intake due to insufficient resources for food.
A report released last month by the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) found that SNAP, the largest federal food and nutrition program, plays an essential role in reducing poverty and food insecurity, and significantly improves the health and wellbeing of low-income families. In 2014 SNAP lifted at least 4.7 million Americans out of poverty, including 2.1 million children, and today helps families across the nation to put food on the table while they work to improve their economic situation. Research shows that among households who receive SNAP, food insecurity rates are up to 30 percent lower than they otherwise would be. But in spite of SNAP’s success, hunger remains a stubborn problem, in part because for many benefits are inadequate to provide enough healthful food to children and families living on a tight budget.
New research cited in the CEA report has linked diminished food budgets at the end of each month to significant consequences, including:
A drop-off in caloric intake among SNAP recipients, with estimates of this decline ranging from 10 to 25 percent over the course of the month;
A 27 percent increase in the rate of hospital admissions due to low blood sugar for low-income adults between the first and last week of the month;
An 11 percent increase in the rate of disciplinary actions among school children in SNAP households between the first and last week of the month;
Diminished student performance on standardized tests, with performance improving only gradually again after the next month’s benefits are received.
Today’s event builds on this commitment to high quality research and will feature perspectives from leading food security and nutrition researchers on the critical role of SNAP in reducing food insecurity and poverty, as well as in improving long-run health, education, and economic outcomes. The panel members, and resources to learn more about their work, are provided below. These resources are provided for informational purposes only and their inclusion does not indicate endorsement by, or the official views of, the U.S. Government:
Dr. Hilary Hoynes, Professor of Public Policy and Economics, Haas Distinguished Chair in Economic Disparities, Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California Berkeley: Dr. Hoynes has reviewed the role that SNAP plays in reducing poverty and food insecurity in the U.S. and examined the degree to which the program helps to buffer the impact of recessions and stagnating wages. More information on Dr. Hoynes’ research is available HERE.
Dr. Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, Faculty Fellow, Institute for Policy Research Associate Professor, Human Development and Social Policy, Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy, Chicago, IL; Director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution: Dr. Schanzenbach, along with her coauthor, Hilary Hoynes, has studied the extent to which SNAP acts as an investment in children’s long term outcomes and its payoff for both recipients and taxpayers. More information on Dr. Schanzenbach’s research is available HERE.
Dr. Adam Drewnowski, Director, Nutritional Sciences Program, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA: Dr. Drewnowski has written about the relationship between diet quality and food cost, including whether inadequate food budgets pose a significant barrier to the adoption of nutrient-adequate diets. More information on Dr. Drewnowski’s research is available HERE.
Dr. Hilary Seligman, Associate Professor, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA; Lead Scientist, Feeding America: Dr. Seligman has summarized research on the connections between food insecurity and health, highlighting some of the medical costs that result from insufficient food budgets.

Dr. Parke Wilde, Associate Professor, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Medford, MA. Dr. Wilde has reviewed recent research on initiatives that enhance SNAP and other benefits to improve recipient households’ success in achieving a high-quality diet, including USDA’s Summer EBT demonstration and the Healthy Incentives Pilot. More information on Dr. Wilde’s research is available HERE.
The event will also feature local and national leaders who see hunger’s effects first hand—in doctors’ offices, classrooms, and communities: Dr. Sandra Hassink, Immediate Past President of the American Academy of Pediatrics; Dawn Pierce, mother, licensed practical nurse, and a former SNAP recipient from Boise, Idaho; Clint Mitchell, Principal at Bel Air Elementary School in Virginia; Carlos Rodriguez, executive director of the Food Bank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties in New Jersey; and Les Johnson with Area Resources for Community and Human Services, which participated in the Summer EBT for Children pilots in Missouri.
Today’s announcements build on ongoing efforts to ensure all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential.
Over the past seven years, the Obama Administration has put in place an historic set of policies to expand opportunity for all Americans. The President, working with Congress, acted to prevent millions from falling into poverty, particularly through the Recovery Act. The Administration championed expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit for working families, which reduce the extent or severity of poverty for more than 16 million people – including about 8 million children – each year. Through the Affordable Care Act, almost 18 million people have gained health insurance and, for the first time on record, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance. Family homelessness has been reduced by 19 percent since 2010. And unemployment has been cut in half, to 5 percent.
The Administration has also developed several initiatives to improve food security and nutrition for vulnerable children. Through the Community Eligibility Provision, schools in high-poverty areas are now able to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students with significantly less administrative burden. And revisions to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) added a cash benefit to allow participants to purchase fruits and vegetables, a change that substantially increased the value of the package.
States and counties are essential in connecting kids to federal nutrition programs. Today, the Administration is highlighting the efforts of State and local leaders that are spearheading aggressive efforts to tackle child hunger. For example, states including Florida, Michigan, Montana, Virginia, and Washington have publicly prioritized combatting childhood hunger, with a particular focus on expanding access to school breakfast programs and adoption of community eligibility:
In the 2011-2012 school year, Michigan became one the first states to adopt the community eligibility option, paving the way for other states to learn from their efforts. For the 2010-2011 school year, Michigan directly certified 72 percent of children in households receiving SNAP benefits who were eligible for direct certification. Over the next few years, Michigan substantially increased its direct certification rate, reaching 87 percent in the 2013-2014 school year.
Montana’s efforts, led by the Governor and First Lady, have made it the state with the highest take up of community eligibility in the nation , with nearly all eligible schools’ participation.
with nearly all eligible schools’ participation. Also with leadership from the First Lady, Virginia is using an $8.8 million demonstration award from USDA to work toward the end child hunger in the Commonwealth, with a strong focus on expanding participation in the school breakfast program.
California is proposing investing new State resources to improving the operations of their nutrition programs with a goal of connecting 400,000 eligible children to nutrition programs over the next two years.
Colorado has created a streamlined online portal for a wide array of nutrition programs as a strategy to consolidate and simplify the application process, thus improving access for busy working families.
Other landmark accomplishments by the Obama Administration to create opportunity for America’s children include the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act, which updated school nutrition standards for the first time in fifteen years; reforms to K-12 education including the Every Student Succeeds Act; expanding access to high quality early education through investments and quality improvements in Head Start, preschool, and child care; and championing both universal pre-K and access to free community college.",12931
693939356390653952,non-rumor,"Michael Oher got a text from Cam Newton during the offseason.

Now, they prepare for #SB50: https://t.co/VS5etSGpZw https://t.co/0KBaaI4BGr",http://es.pn/20gEecO,True,Carolina Panthers' Cam Newton recruited Michael Oher to protect his 'Blind Side',"In September 2009, just after Michael Oher's NFL debut, Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sue Mitchell went to see a private screening of ""The Blind Side"" in California. Their lives were about to be opened up to the world in the movie, a feel-good story that chronicled Oher's rise from homelessness to professional football, and naturally, the women were curious.
Tuohy had spent numerous hours with Sandra Bullock, so many that she now refers to her as ""Sandy."" Bullock wanted to immerse herself in the character, and she shadowed Tuohy and would call constantly, painstakingly trying to nail down her Memphis dialect. ""You are worrying the stew out of me,"" Tuohy would jokingly tell Bullock. ""Go away.""
It was such a weird time. People were going through her closet, trying to figure out what kind of clothes and makeup she wore, and Tuohy said she had only 10 friends, so who would notice if they were right or wrong? And then there was Mitchell, Oher's former tutor who considers herself an ordinary person. Kathy Bates was playing her in the movie.
So they went to the screening, and as they left, Tuohy turned to Mitchell. ""Do you think this is going to be successful?"" she asked.
They weren't prepared for how big it would be.

Offensive linemen are supposed to be the most anonymous men on the football field. If things go right and they're not penalized, humiliated or failing to keep their quarterback upright, their names will not be mentioned much throughout the course of a three-hour game broadcast. Oher, a tackle, always wanted it that way. His whole life, he has stood out, bigger than everyone else and always the new kid as he bounced through 11 different schools before he went to college at Ole Miss.
Oher never wanted to be Cam Newton, or any other star. He just wanted to blend in and be part of something.
The movie, as history goes, only pushed him into the spotlight. It was a box-office smash, grossing more than $309 million and earning Bullock an Academy Award for best actress for her role as a sassy, rich, white woman whose family adopted a poor, black teenager. Seven years later, ""The Blind Side"" floats on endlessly through cable TV, somewhere between ""Law & Order"" and infomercials. (It aired twice last weekend on TNT.)
Editor's Picks Weekend NFL preview: How Panthers, Broncos are preparing for Super Bowl 50 NFL Nation looks ahead to the weekend takes on Carolina and Denver, including the Panthers being healthy at the right time and the Broncos dealing with questions along the offensive line.
Oher does not watch it. On at least two different occasions over the past few years, he has told reporters that he isn't particularly fond of the movie. He believes it has taken away from what he does as a player, and causes people to zero in on every move he makes.
Oher -- by all accounts a kind, mild-mannered fellow -- grew slightly terse last week when asked in the locker room if he still hated the movie. ""I said I didn't hate the movie a while ago,"" he said.
He knows he'll be asked about it many times this week as Carolina prepares to play Denver in Super Bowl 50. The timing of the movie back in '09 was perfect for Hollywood but not so good for a 22-year-old trying to prove himself in the NFL. Soon, his teammates on the Baltimore Ravens saw it, and started calling him ""Big Mike,"" just like Bullock did in the movie. He does not like being called ""Big Mike."" His Carolina teammates have been known to send him funny texts about the movie.
""Of course guys would rib him,"" retired Ravens center Matt Birk said. ""It's a locker room. Guys show no mercy, right? We see weakness and we go for it. But Mike was always good about it. You're 22 years old and there's a Hollywood life story made about your name. I'm sure that's got to be a little strange. People think they know you.""
The entire country has watched the highs and lows of Oher's NFL career: the five seasons in Baltimore, the Super Bowl in the 2012 season, the move to his home state of Tennessee last year. Oher struggled as a Titan, allowing six sacks and 26 quarterback hurries in 11 games in a 2-14 season. Pro Football Focus ranked him one of the worst tackles in the NFL, and Oher drew the ire of numerous frustrated fans. There is a ""Michael Oher Sucks"" forum on the Internet, which, on the top, asks readers, ""Do not post inappropriate comments. This is a friendly forum for fans.""
Oher played with torn biceps all season and injured his toe. He didn't talk much about it, and Birk said he was never one to make excuses. Birk, now the NFL's director of football development, co-authored a book, ""All-Pro Wisdom,"" which included Oher in it.
Birk said he always took pride in being the first one to arrive at the facility in the morning, but that when Oher arrived, he'd always beat Birk there. Birk was surprised that a young guy, a first-round draft pick, was so determined.
On Feb. 5, 2015, the Titans cut Oher. The Tennessean's story called it a move that ""should have blindsided no one.""
Leigh Anne Tuohy still boils at the mention of the Titans.
""We had people, talking heads, that didn't have any clue,"" she said. ""And they're so quick to judge and categorize and pigeonhole.
""It doesn't represent who I am, but I would've loved to have stood out and flipped half of the world off. Take this, because this kid is a warrior, and despite what everyone has said about him, he has played his ass off and he has gotten back to where he always should have been. I've seen the kid fight from Day 1. He has scrapped and fought.""

Oher was rehabbing from toe surgery in the offseason when he received a text from Cam Newton. The quarterback has recruited players before, but not this hard. Newton's brother, Cecil Jr., had played on the practice squad in Baltimore, and he was around Oher every day. They became friends. He knew Oher was talented and professional, and was confident he could protect his brother. Cecil told Cam that Oher would be a key acquisition to the team.
So Newton texted Oher, and he didn't just say he wanted him. He said he needed him. When the Panthers signed Oher to a two-year, $7 million deal this past March, the move was widely criticized. Oher, 29, appeared to be on the downswing.
Oher wound up being the only offensive lineman besides center Ryan Kalil to start every game in 2015 for the Panthers, who surrendered just 61 quarterback hits.
Oher said the message from Newton made him feel at home. For the first time in a while, somebody wanted him. He was reunited with offensive line coach John Matsko, his former coach with the Ravens, and quickly bonded with his teammates. Tuohy says the Panthers players are fun and don't take themselves too seriously. She compares his treatment in Carolina to the way a foster parent should treat a child: You tell him that he's valued and that you believe in him.
Though the commute to Charlotte is tougher than the trip to Nashville, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy try to attend most of Oher's games. Their time is spread thin. Their other son, S.J., who was depicted as a freckle-faced, wisecracking kid in the movie, is now in college and plays guard for the Loyola Maryland basketball team. Some weekends, Sean hits the road to see S.J. and Leigh Anne travels to watch the Panthers.
Sean and Leigh Anne were both at the NFC Championship Game last week in Charlotte. Leigh Anne cried when Oher's name was announced before the game. She always cries when she hears him in the starting lineup.
""Every time he runs out there, it just proves to me that there's hope in the world,"" she said. ""And when given an opportunity, people can change. For seven years now, every time they introduce the offense and he comes out, I cry. People are like, 'Really?' I just can't help it.""

When she sees that the movie is on TV, Mitchell will occasionally sit down and watch. It brings back good memories. She used to teach school during the day, then worked five nights a week tutoring Oher to help him meet NCAA academic requirements.
One of the reasons Oher bristles about ""The Blind Side"" is that he believes it depicts him as being unintelligent. There's a scene in the movie when Oher is at football practice and looks completely clueless, watching a set of balloons drift overhead. He knew far more about football than the movie showed. And Mitchell said Oher is smart. He was just massively behind because no one pushed him to go to school when he was younger.
Oher is the one who started calling Mitchell ""Miss Sue,"" which is what a lot of people refer to her as now. He calls on her birthday, and they text often.
""It's hard to believe that there was ever life without Michael,"" she said. ""It just seems like he's always been a part of all our lives. It was not a come-in-and-leave type thing. Not at all. He's just one of the Tuohys.""

Mitchell texted Oher after the Panthers' 49-15 win against Arizona that landed them in the Super Bowl. She said she was proud of him. She used to go to his games when she still lived in Memphis, but now she's retired and lives in Maine and doesn't travel there as much. She won't talk to him this week as he's getting ready for the game. She doesn't want to distract him.
Mitchell said she never received any money for ""The Blind Side,"" nor anything from the Tuohys to tutor Oher. But she travels and does public speaking now, and serves on the board of Making It Happen, a foundation Leigh Anne started to help needy children.
Ten seconds into a conversation with Leigh Anne, it is clear that ""Sandy"" nailed her character in the movie. She is the unfiltered one in the family, the daughter of a U.S. Marshal who jokingly says she learned to shoot first and ask questions later. Sean is the one whom Michael wants to talk to after games. Sean has his binoculars fixed on him for four quarters and breaks down everything that happened.
Sean can listen to the criticism thrown at Oher and ignore it. Leigh Anne is the only one in the family who can't. Whenever she hears someone criticizing Oher, and she's about to get upset, Sean calmly looks at her and says, ""You just need to take a deep breath.""
Usually, she doesn't.
""I need mouth management in a serious way,"" she said. ""Sometimes, it gets me in a little trouble, and all the family has to clean up after me. I haven't killed anybody. I haven't committed murder, which is good.""
Leigh Anne loves the movie. She said it was 3½ hours at first, ""and I was like, dear God, that's longer than 'Gone With the Wind.'"" Director John Lee Hancock had to do some serious cutting. So there are a few scenes that didn't actually happen but are composites of characters and emotions.
One example would be the country club scene in which her friends are acting snotty and judgmental toward her for taking in Oher. To this day, she still runs into people who ask, ""Was that me in that scene from the country club?""
""And I'm like, was it?"" Leigh Anne said.
""If you think it was, you should probably do a little self-evaluating real quick.""
She doesn't care what people think. Her son is going to the Super Bowl. The whole family will be there. Collins, the Tuohys' daughter, will go with her fiancé. S.J. has a game at Army on Saturday night but will fly cross-country to see his brother play.
Leigh Anne loves the movie because she knows it gives people hope. Collins recently did a speaking engagement, and a woman told her that she adopted a child because of ""The Blind Side."" Maybe that's why Oher backed off from ripping the movie last week. He has tasted success again this season, and remembers the story behind it.
""There are people who want to have this big opinion about how the movie made him [famous],"" she said. ""Talk about the message of the movie. Talk about that there's Michael Ohers in every city in the United States, and if we all turned around and did one simple random act of kindness, it would change the world. Talk about how there's 145,000 kids, adoptable kids, in foster care right now that will age out in the next 90 days and that there's 250,000 faith-based churches and if one church took one kid, we would wipe out the need for foster care.
""Talk about that and the reflection of what the movie gives off. That's what he wants.""",12752

Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.
The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.
It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.
And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.
My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.
In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.
I was sold.
Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.
It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.
That was inspiring to me.
It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.
But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.
I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.
He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.
A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?
This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.
Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.
What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.
[READ: IT HAPPENED TO ME: Donald Trump Ruined My Relationship]
I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.
You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.
He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.
The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.
And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.
He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.
Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.
In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”
Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""
It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.
Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.
[READ: I Thought I'd Be Fine When My Wife Opened Our Marriage, But I Got Drunk and Freaked Out]
The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""
I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.
I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.
The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.
I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.
I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.
I felt sad for him at that moment.
And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.
I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.
He is not.
He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.
His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.
The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.
Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.
And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.
I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.
While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.
[READ: Don't Be So Sure That Donald Trump Can't Win the Republican Nomination — Or the Presidency]
And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.
But something was shifting.
Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.
I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.
And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.
Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.
Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.
I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.
When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.
Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.
Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.
No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ""best"" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other ""best"" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.
He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.
That was inspiring to me.
It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.
But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.
I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.
He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.
A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?
This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.
Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.
What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.
You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.
He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.
The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.
And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.
He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.
Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.
In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”
Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""
It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.
Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.

The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""
I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.
I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.
The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.
I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.
I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.
I felt sad for him at that moment.
And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.
I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.
He is not.
He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.
His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.
The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.
Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.
And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.
I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.
While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.
[READ: Don't Be So Sure That Donald Trump Can't Win the Republican Nomination — Or the Presidency]
And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.
But something was shifting.
Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.
I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.
And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.
Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.
Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.
I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.
When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.
Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.
Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.
No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ""best"" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other ""best"" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.
He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.
The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.
It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.
And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.
My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.
In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.
I was sold.
Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.
It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

714577521992343552,unverified,A Trump campaign strategist just quit and wrote this amazing open letter about why: https://t.co/q376SxDDkF,http://www.xojane.com/issues/stephanie-cegielski-donald-trump-campaign-defector,True,An Open Letter to Trump Voters from His Top Strategist-Turned-Defector,"Even Trump's most trusted advisors didn't expect him to fare this well.
Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.
The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.
It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.
And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.
My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.
In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.
I was sold.
Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.
It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.
That was inspiring to me.
It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.
But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.
I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.
He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.
A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?
This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.
Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.
What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.
You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.
He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.
The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.
And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.
He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.
Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.
In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”
Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""
It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.
Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.
[READ: I Thought I'd Be Fine When My Wife Opened Our Marriage, But I Got Drunk and Freaked Out]
The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""
I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.
I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.
The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.
I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.
I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.
I felt sad for him at that moment.
And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.
I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.
He is not.
He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.
His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.
The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.
Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.
And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.
I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.
While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.
[READ: Don't Be So Sure That Donald Trump Can't Win the Republican Nomination — Or the Presidency]
And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.
But something was shifting.
Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.
I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.
And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.
Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.
Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.
I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.
When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.
Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.
Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.

And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.
But something was shifting.
Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.
I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.
And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.
Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.

I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.
When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.
Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.
Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.
No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ""best"" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other ""best"" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.
He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.
The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.
It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.
And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.
My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.
In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.
I was sold.
Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.
It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.
That was inspiring to me.
It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.
But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.
I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.
He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.
A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?
This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.
Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.
What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.
You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.
He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.
The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.
And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.
He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.
Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.
In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”
Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""
It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.
Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.

The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""
I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.
I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.
The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.
I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.
I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.
I felt sad for him at that moment.
And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.
I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.
He is not.
He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.
His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.
The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.

778299287293816832,unverified,Will NY AG investigate Clinton campaign credit card fraud re elderly donors? https://t.co/XtvJz9klmA https://t.co/lV6z7hJO5v,http://observer.com/2016/09/exclusive-hillary-clinton-campaign-systematically-overcharging-poorest-donors/,True,Exclusive: Hillary Clinton Campaign Systematically Overcharging Poorest Donors,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is stealing from her poorest supporters by purposefully and repeatedly overcharging them after they make what’s supposed to be a one-time small donation through her official campaign website, multiple sources tell the Observer.
The overcharges are occurring so often that the fraud department at one of the nation’s biggest banks receives up to 100 phone calls a day from Clinton’s small donors asking for refunds for unauthorized charges to their bankcards made by Clinton’s campaign. One elderly Clinton donor, who has been a victim of this fraud scheme, has filed a complaint with her state’s attorney general and a representative from the office told her that they had forwarded her case to the Federal Election Commission.
“We get up to a hundred calls a day from Hillary’s low-income supporters complaining about multiple unauthorized charges,” a source, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of job security, from the Wells Fargo fraud department told the Observer. The source claims that the Clinton campaign has been pulling this stunt since Spring of this year. The Hillary for America campaign will overcharge small donors by repeatedly charging small amounts such as $20 to the bankcards of donors who made a one-time donation. However, the Clinton campaign strategically doesn’t overcharge these donors $100 or more because the bank would then be obligated to investigate the fraud.
“We don’t investigate fraudulent charges unless they are over $100,” the fraud specialist explained. “The Clinton campaign knows this, that’s why we don’t see any charges over the $100 amount, they’ll stop the charges just below $100. We’ll see her campaign overcharge donors by $20, $40 or $60 but never more than $100.” The source, who has worked for Wells Fargo for over 10 years, said that the total amount they refund customers on a daily basis who have been overcharged by Clinton’s campaign “varies” but the bank usually issues refunds that total between $700 and $1,200 per day.
The fraud specialist said that Clinton donors who call in will attempt to resolve the issue with the campaign first but they never get anywhere. “They will call the Clinton campaign to get their refund and the issue never gets resolved. So they call us and we just issue the refund. The Clinton campaign knows these charges are small potatoes and that we’ll just refund the money back.”
The source said that pornography companies often deploy a similar arrangement pull. “We see this same scheme with a lot of seedy porn companies,” the source said. The source also notes that the dozens of phone calls his department receives daily are from people who notice the fraudulent charges on their statements. “The people who call us are just the ones who catch the fraudulent charges. I can’t imagine how many more people are getting overcharged by Hillary’s campaign and they have no idea.”
The source said he’s apolitical but noted that the bank’s fraud department is yet to receive one call from a Donald Trump supporter claiming to have been overcharged by Trump’s campaign. “I’m only talking to you because what Hillary’s doing is so messed up, she’s stealing from her poorest supporters.”
Wells Fargo recently came under fire after news broke that various regulators fined the big bank $185 million for opening 2 million phony customer accounts without their customers’ permission. This massive scandal resulted in the firing of 5,300 Wells Fargo employees.
Carol Mahre, an 81-year-old grandmother of seven from Minnesota, is one of the victims of Clinton’s campaign donor fraud scandal. In March, Mahre said she made a one-time $25 donation via Clinton’s official campaign website. However, when she received her U.S. Bank card statement, she noticed multiple $25 charges were made. Mahre, who said in an interview she only contributed $25 because she’s “not rich” and that’s all she could afford, contacted her son, Roger Mahre, to help her dispute the unauthorized charges.
Roger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. “It took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,” Roger said. “After I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.”
Incredibly, the very next day, Carol’s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. “I was told they would stop charging my mother’s card but they never stopped.” He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. “She’s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.” Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should’ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should’ve stopped but they never did.
The Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign’s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.
Since the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother’s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson’s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother’s card.
A representative from Minnesota’s Democratic attorney general’s office told Roger that this problem wasn’t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC. However, FEC spokesperson Julia Queen told the Observer they have no record of the case. “We don’t have it,” Queen said. The Observer contacted Swanson’s office and did not hear back.
Roger did eventually get a letter from a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign. In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.
“They basically said that they weren’t accepting responsibility for this but they’d remove my mom from the donor list,” he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. “This is a load of crap!” Mahre said. “The self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane. If you and I did this, we’d be thrown in jail. This is theft, fraud or wire fraud—it’s a federal crime!”
Since Carol’s story became public, Roger said he’s heard from other people who have been ripped off by the Clinton campaign. “I’ve heard this is happening to other small donors,” Roger said. “People will donate $25, but then when they receive their credit card statement, they are charged $25 multiple times.”
The incident hasn’t just left a bad taste in Roger’s mouth. Carol decided she’s not going to vote for Hillary even though she’s voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every election since President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection in 1956. “My mother is a lifelong Democrat and she’s voted every election in her life for a Democrat but she’s not going to vote for Hillary,” Roger said.
The New York Times reported in 2007 that Clinton’s first presidential campaign had to refund and subtract hundreds of thousands of dollars from its first-quarter total often because donors’ credit cards were charged twice. Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama’s campaign refunded.
Another bank source told the Observer that Clinton’s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. “This gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,” the source said. “The money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election. This gives off the illusion to the public that her support and the amount she’s raised is much greater than what it is in reality.”
A Clinton campaign worker named Kathy Callahan, who worked on Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, claimed in a blog post that Clinton fraudulently overcharged her by several thousand dollars. She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign’s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton’s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of “begging and pleading,” she wasn’t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.
Callahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton’s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, “What happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.” McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan’s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.
In 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill’s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton’s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise. Facing strong criticism, the Clintons decided to return several items including $28,500 in furnishings and they paid $86,000 for other gifts.
Murmurs of theft are nothing new to the Clintons. But Bill begs to differ.
He recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don’t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they’re robbing some of Hillary’s most impoverished supporters—including a poor elderly grandma—to fund her campaign.

778530869208190976,unverified,Hillary Overcharges Poorest Campaign Donors @LindaSuhler @RealDrGina @GirlsForTrump @cinderella2b @KamVTV #US #USA🇺🇸https://t.co/uueCaLKK2m,http://observer.com/2016/09/exclusive-hillary-clinton-campaign-systematically-overcharging-poorest-donors/#.V9sjBzHuICs.twitter,True,Exclusive: Hillary Clinton Campaign Systematically Overcharging Poorest Donors,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is stealing from her poorest supporters by purposefully and repeatedly overcharging them after they make what’s supposed to be a one-time small donation through her official campaign website, multiple sources tell the Observer.
The overcharges are occurring so often that the fraud department at one of the nation’s biggest banks receives up to 100 phone calls a day from Clinton’s small donors asking for refunds for unauthorized charges to their bankcards made by Clinton’s campaign. One elderly Clinton donor, who has been a victim of this fraud scheme, has filed a complaint with her state’s attorney general and a representative from the office told her that they had forwarded her case to the Federal Election Commission.
“We get up to a hundred calls a day from Hillary’s low-income supporters complaining about multiple unauthorized charges,” a source, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of job security, from the Wells Fargo fraud department told the Observer. The source claims that the Clinton campaign has been pulling this stunt since Spring of this year. The Hillary for America campaign will overcharge small donors by repeatedly charging small amounts such as $20 to the bankcards of donors who made a one-time donation. However, the Clinton campaign strategically doesn’t overcharge these donors $100 or more because the bank would then be obligated to investigate the fraud.
“We don’t investigate fraudulent charges unless they are over $100,” the fraud specialist explained. “The Clinton campaign knows this, that’s why we don’t see any charges over the $100 amount, they’ll stop the charges just below $100. We’ll see her campaign overcharge donors by $20, $40 or $60 but never more than $100.” The source, who has worked for Wells Fargo for over 10 years, said that the total amount they refund customers on a daily basis who have been overcharged by Clinton’s campaign “varies” but the bank usually issues refunds that total between $700 and $1,200 per day.
The fraud specialist said that Clinton donors who call in will attempt to resolve the issue with the campaign first but they never get anywhere. “They will call the Clinton campaign to get their refund and the issue never gets resolved. So they call us and we just issue the refund. The Clinton campaign knows these charges are small potatoes and that we’ll just refund the money back.”
The source said that pornography companies often deploy a similar arrangement pull. “We see this same scheme with a lot of seedy porn companies,” the source said. The source also notes that the dozens of phone calls his department receives daily are from people who notice the fraudulent charges on their statements. “The people who call us are just the ones who catch the fraudulent charges. I can’t imagine how many more people are getting overcharged by Hillary’s campaign and they have no idea.”
The source said he’s apolitical but noted that the bank’s fraud department is yet to receive one call from a Donald Trump supporter claiming to have been overcharged by Trump’s campaign. “I’m only talking to you because what Hillary’s doing is so messed up, she’s stealing from her poorest supporters.”
Wells Fargo recently came under fire after news broke that various regulators fined the big bank $185 million for opening 2 million phony customer accounts without their customers’ permission. This massive scandal resulted in the firing of 5,300 Wells Fargo employees.
Carol Mahre, an 81-year-old grandmother of seven from Minnesota, is one of the victims of Clinton’s campaign donor fraud scandal. In March, Mahre said she made a one-time $25 donation via Clinton’s official campaign website. However, when she received her U.S. Bank card statement, she noticed multiple $25 charges were made. Mahre, who said in an interview she only contributed $25 because she’s “not rich” and that’s all she could afford, contacted her son, Roger Mahre, to help her dispute the unauthorized charges.
Roger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. “It took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,” Roger said. “After I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.”
Incredibly, the very next day, Carol’s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. “I was told they would stop charging my mother’s card but they never stopped.” He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. “She’s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.” Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should’ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should’ve stopped but they never did.
The Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign’s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.
Since the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother’s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson’s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother’s card.
A representative from Minnesota’s Democratic attorney general’s office told Roger that this problem wasn’t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC. However, FEC spokesperson Julia Queen told the Observer they have no record of the case. “We don’t have it,” Queen said. The Observer contacted Swanson’s office and did not hear back.
Roger did eventually get a letter from a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign. In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.
“They basically said that they weren’t accepting responsibility for this but they’d remove my mom from the donor list,” he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. “This is a load of crap!” Mahre said. “The self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane.

692410832307818497,non-rumor,Will you watch Thursday’s #GOPDebate if @realDonaldTrump is not on stage? https://t.co/WOUuCB14Ez,http://politi.co/1SbrFeK,True,Fox's O'Reilly pleads with Trump to reconsider debate boycott,"Fox's O'Reilly pleads with Trump to reconsider debate boycott 'I submit to you that you need to change and get away from the personal,' O'Reilly tells the real estate mogul in a testy interview.
Donald Trump on Wednesday night testily tangled with Bill O’Reilly as the Fox News host asked Trump to reconsider his decision to boycott the Thursday night GOP debate. The real estate mogul and Republican poll leader refused to budge.
“I want you to consider,” O’Reilly pleaded with Trump, asking him to say, “I might come back, forgive, go forward, answer the question, look out for the folks, just consider it.”
Story Continued Below
Trump shot back that the question was out of bounds. “We had an agreement that you wouldn’t ask me that,” he said.
O’Reilly conceded that Trump was telling the truth, and gave him credit for coming on his show, but said the American people need to hear from the man who has a good chance of becoming the Republican nominee.
“You could absolutely secure this Republican nomination,” the Fox News host said. “I submit to you that you need to change and get away from the personal.”
But O’Reilly peppered his words of encouragement with insults, accusing Trump of “walking away” and getting sidetracked by petty disputes.
“I don’t like being taken advantage of,” Trump said, referencing his grievance with Fox’s refusal to remove Megyn Kelly as a moderator from the debate, after Trump accused her of being biased against him. “I’m not going to let our country be taken advantage of,” Trump added, citing the Iran deal as a prime example.
Trump is so far defying skeptics who are dismissing his declaration that he will boycott Thursday night’s debate as a mere bluff, as he forges ahead with an alternate plan to raise funds for veterans that threatens to soak up media attention in the days before the Iowa caucuses.
The real estate mogul, still steaming from his feud with Fox News and Kelly, refused to heed O’Reilly’s advice to “turn the other cheek,” saying “it’s called an eye for an eye.”
Speaking at a South Carolina rally that occurred before the O’Reilly appearance aired, but after it was taped, Trump called it a “tough interview” but promised that his rival event in Des Moines raising funds for veterans would be a great one.
“We’re going to raise a lot of money for the vets,” said a boisterous Trump, donning his signature red “Make America Great Again” cap.
Trump’s staying of the course comes after speculation grew on Wednesday about whether he was really going to sit out the primetime showdown, or if it was all a bunch of bluster.
Doubters, including some of his rivals, saw either a shrewd maneuver that directed an inordinate amount of media attention on him as the GOP field tried to make their closing arguments to caucus-goers, or a clever gimmick that allowed Trump to avoid harsh questioning as he’s come under increased fire for his shifting position on issues such as abortion.
""I've got a $20 bet he shows up,"" Jeb Bush said during a town hall in Des Moines Wednesday afternoon.
""I expect to see Trump on stage tomorrow,"" tweeted John Kasich's campaign manager, John Weaver.
“Donald Trump will be at the debate,” Ted Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler Tyler predicted. “Mark my words.”
Even Kelly, the Fox debate moderator who is the focus of Trump’s ire, called him out. “I will be surprised if he doesn’t show up, Donald Trump is a showman, he’s very good at generating interest, perhaps this is an effort to generate interest in our debate, if it is that is great, maybe we will have more eyeballs, if he doesn’t show up maybe we will have fewer eyeballs, but either way it is going to be ok,” Kelly told “Extra.”
Trump’s decision to once again wage war on Fox and Kelly so close to the Iowa caucuses is either a shrewd one or a boneheaded one, depending on who you ask. While some are contending that Trump risks coming off as a coward walking away from a fight, it’s undeniable that he’s robbing the media oxygen from his rivals.
Trump earlier on Wednesday showed no outward signs of relenting, citing a bitter relationship with Fox News and Kelly. The real estate mogul also sent out to the media a few scant details about his rival event for Thursday evening – a ""Donald J. Trump Special Event to Benefit Veterans Organizations"" at Drake University in Des Moines.
But there were a few indications that he might soften his stance: A Twitter poll he posted asking whether he should participate in the debate urged him to appear, with 56 percent of the 157,864 votes saying he should do the debate.
Then, on Wednesday afternoon, he revealed that he still planned to appear Wednesday night on Bill O'Reilly's Fox News program.
Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told CNN Wednesday evening that his boss was still appearing on the show because “when we make a promise, we keep it,” except for when Trump is treated unfairly. He also said he has had no conversations with Fox News CEO, and that, to the best of his knowledge, neither has Trump.
The tiff apparently started after Trump tried to pressure Fox News to boot Kelly as one of the moderators, claiming there was no way she could be unbiased. Kelly gained heightened notoriety after pointedly asking Trump at the first debate about his supposed “war on women.” (O’Reilly on Wednesday night defended the question as “within journalistic bounds.”)
But Fox refused to give in, issuing a biting press statement on Tuesday saying, “We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.”
Fox doubled down after Trump’s declaration of a boycott, issuing a statement Tuesday night that accused Lewandowski of threatening the network with ""terrorizations"" of Kelly.
“In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive, Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a ‘rough couple of days after that last debate’ and he ‘would hate to have her go through that again,’” the network alleged.
The Republican National Committee took an above-the-fray position on the developing drama on Wednesday afternoon, noting that Rand Paul, too, opted to skip a debate -- the undercard debate earlier this month.
“We’d love all candidates in,"" said Sean Spicer, the RNC's communications director, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday afternoon. ""I think it’s a great opportunity for the American people, and particularly the people in Iowa, to have an understanding of each of these candidates’ vision. But, Wolf, at the end of the day, each campaign has to make up their own mind as to what’s in their best interest so we respect that decision.""
Spicer added that he anticipates Fox will not show Trump's empty lecturn on screen.
Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, meanwhile, sided with Trump on the dispute. ""Fox News was acting like they had been jilted at the altar,"" Limbaugh said on Wednesday.
Nobody since the Kennedy family has had such an outsize influence on the media, Limbaugh mused to listeners. And the Kennedys ""are pikers compared to the way Trump is doing this,"" he added.
""Screw the rules, he's saying,"" Limbaugh remarked, according to a transcript, talking through Trump's reasoning. ""Why should I willingly give them another shot at me in a circumstance they control, why should I do it? What's the sense in it for me? I'm leading; I'm running the pack here; why in the world should I put myself in that circumstance? I've already seen what's gonna happen.""
Trump on Wednesday morning slammed Fox for its allegations against him, saying on Twitter, “The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb.”
He also lobbed an attack on Kelly, tweeting, “I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!”
Lewandowski himself dismissed Fox as being an unfair broker and tried to dispel the notion that Trump is worried that a final debate before the caucuses could expose weaknesses in his candidacy.
Trump is ""the best debater on the debate stage, we know this, he’s the clear winner, he has been by every debate poll that’s taken place,” he said on “Morning Joe.”
""He’s not afraid to debate. I want to be very clear about this,"" he said. ""He’s done more television, more radio, than all of the other candidates combined. And so, he’s not afraid to answer questions. He’s on your show all the time, he was on yesterday. But the bottom line is, you have people that aren’t going to be fair and ask questions the American people want to talk about, and instead they want to make this about themselves. And that’s what this is about, and it’s a shame.”
Asked about Cruz's call for a one-on-one debate before Monday's caucuses in Iowa, Lewandowski said the Texas senator's campaign was not the only one to reach out asking whether it could participate in the alternate event Trump’s campaign was setting up.
“Well, look, he’s not the only one. We’ve had calls from many debates, from many of the candidates now, to say look, why would we participate in the Fox debate as well? I think what you’re finding out, once again, you have the candidates reacting to the only true leader in this race, which is Donald Trump,"" Lewandowski claimed.
One veterans group signaled it has no interest in partnering with Trump for his counterprogramming event. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, tweeted that Trump shouldn't be rewarded for his antics.
""If offered, @iava will decline donations from Trump's event,"" he wrote. ""We need strong policies from candidates, not to be used for political stunts.""
The Wounded Warrior Project said in an email to POLITICO on Wednesday afternoon, ""We are not aware of any fundraising efforts on our behalf with Mr. Donald Trump.""
It’s not clear how a resolution would be brokered between Trump and Fox, and Lewandowski kept up the war of words on Wednesday evening, telling CNN it was a pretty simple decision for Trump to boycott the debate.
“It's very simple: he's able and willing to debate but he's not going to do it if the network is not going to be fair,” he said.

""You've heard the old saying, 'Dying is easy, comedy is hard,'"" said Fox TV Group chairman Gary Newman at a cake-cutting ceremony in January celebrating the longevity of his studio's Tim Allen starrer Last Man Standing. ""Well, nothing is harder than broadcast comedy, and our show defied the odds."" In the 2010-11 TV season, the four networks ordered a total of 42 comedy pilots. Of those, 16 were picked up to series. Now, only three remain on the air. And of those three, only one stars the guy who voiced Buzz Lightyear and made Home Improvement one of the biggest sitcom hits of the '90s (others in that club include Seinfeld and Roseanne).
As the ABC comedy prepares to mark its 100th episode threshold Jan. 29, its viewership is holding steady at 8.7 million, making the 20th Century Fox TV-produced multicam the No. 1 show in its Friday slot. THR sat down with the always irascible Tim Allen, 62, and talked about his return to network TV, how he relates to his right wing character and why he thinks Donald Trump ""might be able to do the stuff that needs fixing.""
Why did you return to network TV?
I had people approach me. But I'm no idiot. I said, ""Show me what you got."" Once was great with Home Improvement, but to have it twice is a blessing. CBS and ABC both pitched shows, and they were all great on their own, but it was almost a mirror of Home Improvement. So it took a couple of late-night sessions with [creator] Jack Burditt, who wrote the pilot off of our ideas.
The development process wasn't exactly smooth sailing, right?
It was difficult. I'm an executive producer and the alleged star of the show, so I was a big gorilla in the room, and a lot of [Burditt's writers] were not used to that. It wasn't my way or the highway, but there were a lot of struggles of very strong personalities to get it where it is.
Whose idea was it for Mike Baxter to have loud, conservative political views?
I brought that to the table. I wanted to be provocative. Mike Baxter is an educated Archie Bunker.
Do you have more comedic leeway now than you did on Home Improvement?
Definitely. But you know what? I've earned it. I don't say that lightly. I've been on a successful show and learned from the best. But I find Last Man Standing actually rougher than Home Improvement. We're getting away with a lot of stuff. I'm really shocked. This is a meaner, sharper comedy than I'm used to. There's a lot of times our very liberal writing staff will come up with stuff that even my character would say, ""I don't know if I can say that.""
From left: Amanda Fuller, Molly Ephraim, Nancy Travis and Kaitlyn Dever.
How much is playing this right-leaning character an outlet for you to express your own political views?
It's getting more and more comfortable. These guys know me so well that they're writing stuff that is exactly what I would've said. It's a marvelous thing when you have lib­eral people writing for [a show like this]. I believe Stephen Colbert was like that. He was pretending to be a conservative, I think. Someone said that. I never got that, but maybe I didn't watch it enough.
Has the line between you and your character blurred over the years?
It definitely has. If you go see my stand-up at the Mirage in Vegas — I'm on a concert tour this year, as I have been for 30 years — it tends to be very angry about self-reliance. I'm not going to say it's conservative, but it certainly is not left. For most of my life, I've been taxed above 38 percent. When you're a young guy working the road and literally close to half of what you make goes to people who don't help you at all but just bitch about it the whole time, that's where I come from. I come from ""no taxation without representation,"" and it manifests itself in very peculiar points of view.
How are you different from Mike?
He's milder than I am. You wouldn't want to hear what I have to say. Escalate Mike Baxter with profanity and that's basically me. He's much more tepid because he's a business owner. Mike Baxter is calmed way down, and I'm definitely not that guy.
What riles you up the most?
Unearned responses, unearned praise, unearned income: I have opinions about it. When you watch the debates, on both sides you see clowns who say shit that ain't ever going to happen, but lately one party is the free shit party. They are just telling people they're going to get all sorts of free shit. When you say you're going to get free education, free health care — f—, free brown loafers — of course everybody's going to say yes to that. But you don't mean it. That's how you rack up debt, and debt is killing us. Whatever party is going to get us out of debt is my party.
Tim Allen
What party is that?
I met with John Kasich, a great guy. He's a Republican that Democrats would vote for, a Republican the Republicans should respect. But he's not saying provocative things. He's not glib enough or he doesn't speak well enough because somehow he doesn't get traction. So we'll end up with somebody scary.
Who scares you?
Well, we asked the female writing staff if they'd vote for Hillary just because she's a woman, and they all said yes. So then the question was, ""So if Sarah Palin was the female?"" They all choked and they had to say, ""Oh God, yes, we'd vote for her."" I didn't quite buy it. I don't think you should vote for somebody just because they're tall, thin, yellow, green, whatever. Bernie Sanders, as nice a guy as he is, none of that shit's going to happen. And Trump can't send everybody to Mexico or whatever the f— he said. But give that guy the roads, bridges, infrastructure, power grid — just have him fix that shit for four years. He's good at that. And he's a businessman so he understands how debt load works. Forget the stupid shit he says about immigrants. That's just ignorant. But he might be able to do the stuff that really needs fixing.
So you're not opposed to Trump?
I'm not opposed to anybody if their workload matches their bullshit load.
Why has the show gone after Hillary but not Trump?
It's a little surprising to me. We have a very liberal writing staff, so I'm surprised they haven't taken a shot at him. But we're not sure he's going to last, whereas the Clintons are like herpes: Just when you think they're gone, they show up again.
Didn't you try a bit about Obama raising the communist flag at the White House that never made it to air?
We got network notes saying you can't call the president a communist. So, of course, I really wanted to. I do it in rehearsal all day long.

The Execs and Creatives Who Helped Get 'Standing' on Its Feet
How the ABC sitcom made it on the air and survived five seasons, multiple showrunners and a lot of politics
Jack Burditt (creator): ""When I was working on 30 Rock, my agent called me and said that Tim Allen was interested in doing a sitcom again and that he wanted to do a show about a guy trying to remain a guy in a world surrounded by women. Tina Fey and Robert Carlock both said: 'You’re really an idiot if you don’t do this. This guy is going to get you on the air.'""
Marty Adelstein (executive producer): ""We went to dinner with Tim, and he says, 'I love the script, but I’m not doing it.' He wanted to do something different, which was break the fourth wall. I said: 'My kids have their own video blog. Your character could have a vlog.' And it became a really good outlet for him to express his opinions. If you look at all the shows with comedians that work, they’re pretty true to who they are.""
Becky Clements (executive producer): ""We went through a long development process addressing his concerns. Honestly, when you’re someone like Tim Allen, who has done many things professionally very successfully, the possibility of being less than successful is a daunting seat to be in. It was nerve-racking for him to put himself out there again in the world and potentially not have another Home Improvement.""
Gary Newman (Fox TV Group chairman and CEO): ""There was a real bidding war between ABC and CBS. At the time, CBS was really the only network with successful multicams. But ABC had a history with Tim in Home Improvement and the Toy Story movies, so they had a huge investment in staying in business with him. Paul Lee made an impassioned plea, as did Bob Iger, who spoke to Tim and convinced him to do it at ABC.""
Paul Lee (ABC Entertainment president): ""When I first started at ABC in 2010, I was obsessed with getting Tim back on the network. We courted him hard. He has such a palpable charisma and the ability to make an audience fall in love with him. He brought multicams back to ABC and comedy back to Friday nights, along with a dissonant voice that we didn’t have on the network that has resonated across the country.""
Tim Doyle (showrunner/EP, seasons two through four): ""Tim and I started arguing about politics because I’m a huge lefty. I thought, 'Let’s give Mike Baxter opinions that relate to the real world.' We wanted to play on the Mitt Romney dog on the car incident by joking that’s how Obama transports Joe Biden. ABC's standards department said, 'That is unacceptable to disrespect the vice president.' There was tons of stuff like that.""
Dana Walden (Fox TV Group chairman and CEO): ""That right-leaning, committed to their point of view character? Not really anywhere else on television. It was an underrepresented voice, particularly on broadcast networks. Strategically, that’s who we’re trying to appeal to, the underserved right-leaning audience. But it started organically with the fundamental bones of who Tim’s character is.""
Matt Berry (current showrunner/EP): ""I came in the fifth season, but Tim Allen and I go way, way back to when we were both starting out as comics. It was cool for me after 22 years to suddenly land back on a show headlined by my buddy from when I was first getting going. That Tim Allen has taken two shows past the 100-episode mark is an extraordinary feat. There are not a lot of people out here that can say that.""",10447

Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said in a statement released Friday morning.

On the other hand, Mr. Grassi, a 67-year-old caterer, told The New York Times that he and the pontiff have known each other since the 1960s, when Jorge Mario Bergoglio, as the future pope was then called, taught him literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, a Jesuit high school in Santa Fe, Argentina.
Mr. Grassi said that he had resumed contact with the future pope years later, when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires. He also visited the pope at the Vatican in September 2013, and later contacted his office to ask for an audience in Washington.
“Once I saw how busy and exhausting his schedule was in D.C., I wrote back to him saying perhaps it would be better to meet some other time,” Mr. Grassi said. “Then he called me on the phone and he told me that he would love to give me a hug in Washington.”
Mr. Grassi said that he had been accompanied by his partner of 19 years, Iwan Bagus, as well as four friends, and that the meeting took place at the Vatican Embassy on Sept. 23 — a day before Ms. Davis met the pope.
Mr. Grassi said that Francis had told him to arrange the visit through the office of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the papal nuncio, or envoy, in Washington.
“It was a private meeting, for about 15 to 20 minutes, in which I brought my boyfriend of 19 years,” Mr. Grassi said. His boyfriend, Mr. Bagus, worked on a video that was posted online that showed Francis hugging Mr. Grassi and the others.
Mr. Grassi said the meeting was purely personal. “I don’t think he was trying to say anything in particular,” Mr. Grassi said. “He was just meeting with his ex-student and a very close friend of his.”
Late on Friday, the Vatican confirmed the meeting. “Mr. Yayo Grassi, a former Argentine student of Pope Francis, who had already met other times in the past with the pope, asked to present his mother and several friends to the Pope during the Pope’s stay in Washington, D.C.,” Father Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said in a statement.
“As noted in the past, the pope, as pastor, has maintained many personal relationships with people in a spirit of kindness, welcome and dialogue,” the statement added.
Earlier on Friday, the Vatican said that Archbishop Viganò had arranged the pope’s meetings in Washington, including the one with Ms. Davis.
The news of the meeting with Ms. Davis was disclosed late Tuesday night by Ms. Davis’s lawyer, Mathew D. Staver, at the same time it was reported on the website of Inside the Vatican, a conservative publication edited by an American who has covered the Vatican for years.
For nearly eight hours, Vatican officials refused to confirm or deny that the meeting had occurred, before finally confirming it on Wednesday afternoon.
For Francis, the timing of the Davis controversy is not ideal. Beginning Sunday the Vatican is staging a critical three-week meeting of bishops and laypeople to discuss whether to recommend changing their approach to contemporary issues related to the family, like gay couples, single parents or whether divorced and remarried Catholics who have not obtained annulments should be allowed to receive communion.
That meeting, known as a synod, could become a showdown between liberals and conservatives. Francis has spent nearly two years trying to gradually build consensus and has repeatedly stated his desire for a more welcoming, merciful outreach — even as he has not signaled any willingness to change church doctrine.
News of his meeting with Ms. Davis buoyed Christian conservatives, who had been dismayed that the pope, in his emphasis on the poor, barely mentioned issues like abortion and homosexuality during his visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia. It also puzzled and angered more liberal observers.
It also led observers of the Vatican to speculate about whether the encounter with Ms. Davis was a signal of support for her cause. Francis has emphasized that he strongly believes in conscientious objection as a human right, a position he reaffirmed on his plane ride home.
On Friday, the Vatican appeared to be distancing itself from Ms. Davis’s camp. Father Lombardi’s statement said that the brief meeting “has continued to provoke comments and discussion,” and that he was providing clarification “in order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.”

The Vatican’s statement prompted reactions on both sides of the Atlantic.
In a phone interview on Friday, Mr. Staver said the meeting had been called by the Vatican.
“This was a private meeting initiated by the Vatican,” Mr. Staver said. “My contacts were Vatican officials in the United States. And I was informed the request came directly from the pontiff.”
Mr. Staver said the request had come on Sept. 14, the day Ms. Davis returned to work after her release from jail. Ms. Davis and her husband were picked up at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in a tan van by private security guards who spoke Italian, he said. She had been instructed to change her hairstyle so she would not be identified.
Mr. Staver said Ms. Davis was not among a large group of people meeting the pope. She saw no one else waiting to see the pope and no one else saw her. “Just think about it. If she was in a line, there is no way this could have been kept secret for five days,” he said.
But at the Vatican on Friday, a spokesman, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, said the invitation had been extended by the nuncio’s office — not from Rome.
“Who brought her in? The nuncio,” said Father Rosica, who is working with the Vatican’s media office in advance of a major meeting of bishops that begins this weekend. “The Nunciature was able to bring in donors, benefactors.”
Father Rosica said of the controversy: “I would simply say: Her case is a very complex case. It’s got all kinds of intricacies. Was there an opportunity to brief the pope on this beforehand? I don’t think so. A list is given — these are the people you are going to meet.”
Mr. Staver, for his part, said he had been briefly introduced to Archbishop Viganò in April, when he spoke at a large rally in Washington against same-sex marriage, before the Supreme Court ruled on the issue.
The Rev. James Martin, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, had cautioned in an article this week that the pope meets many well-wishers on his trips, and that news of the meeting with Ms. Davis had been manipulated.
“I was very disappointed to see the pope having been used that way, and that his willingness to be friendly to someone was turned against him,” Father Martin said in an interview on Friday. “What may originally have prevented them from issuing a statement was the desire not to give this story too much air. But what they eventually came to realize was that they needed to correct some gross misrepresentations of what had happened. It shows that Pope Francis met with many people on the trip, and that she was simply another person who he tried to be kind to.”
Father Rosica’s statement seemed to square with that account.
Asked on Friday if the Vatican press office had been unaware that Ms. Davis had met the pope, Father Rosica said: “No, but I think we may not have been aware of the full impact of the meeting. It is very difficult sometimes when you are looking at things in America from here.”
A receptionist who answered the phone at the Vatican Embassy in Washington on Friday said, “The nuncio does not deny that the meeting took place, but would not make any further comment.”
She said the embassy did not have its own spokesman, and that no other officials there would comment.
Archbishop Viganò is turning 75 in January, the age at which bishops must submit a formal request to the Vatican asking for permission to resign. These requests are not automatically accepted, and bishops often stay in their appointments well past age 75. But if Archbishop Viganò is held responsible for what is seen as a grave misstep on an important papal trip, he is likely to be removed at the first respectable opportunity, according to several church analysts.
“Nobody in the Catholic Church wants another Regensburg,” said Massimo Faggioli, an associate professor of theology and director of the Institute for Catholicism and Citizenship at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. He was referring to the backlash after Pope Benedict XVI, Francis’ predecessor, gave a speech in Regensburg, Germany, that appeared to denigrate Islam.
“This was not as serious as Regensburg, when Benedict read his own speech,” Dr. Faggioli said about the meeting attended by Ms. Davis. “But the pope has to be able to rely on his own system, and in this case the system failed him. The question is, was it a mistake, or was it done with full knowledge of how toxic she was?”
The meeting with Ms. Davis was clearly a misstep, Dr. Faggioli said, “because the whole trip to the United States he very carefully didn’t want to give the impression that he was being politicized by any side.”
He added, “And this thing is the most politicized thing that you can imagine.”",10137

The meeting with Ms. Davis was clearly a misstep, Dr. Faggioli said, “because the whole trip to the United States he very carefully didn’t want to give the impression that he was being politicized by any side.”

Francis in America News and features on Pope Francis’ visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia in September, his first visit ever. Blog | Full Coverage
On the other hand, Mr. Grassi, a 67-year-old caterer, told The New York Times that he and the pontiff have known each other since the 1960s, when Jorge Mario Bergoglio, as the future pope was then called, taught him literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, a Jesuit high school in Santa Fe, Argentina.
Mr. Grassi said that he had resumed contact with the future pope years later, when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires. He also visited the pope at the Vatican in September 2013, and later contacted his office to ask for an audience in Washington.
“Once I saw how busy and exhausting his schedule was in D.C., I wrote back to him saying perhaps it would be better to meet some other time,” Mr. Grassi said. “Then he called me on the phone and he told me that he would love to give me a hug in Washington.”
Mr. Grassi said that he had been accompanied by his partner of 19 years, Iwan Bagus, as well as four friends, and that the meeting took place at the Vatican Embassy on Sept. 23 — a day before Ms. Davis met the pope.
Mr. Grassi said that Francis had told him to arrange the visit through the office of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the papal nuncio, or envoy, in Washington.
“It was a private meeting, for about 15 to 20 minutes, in which I brought my boyfriend of 19 years,” Mr. Grassi said. His boyfriend, Mr. Bagus, worked on a video that was posted online that showed Francis hugging Mr. Grassi and the others.
Mr. Grassi said the meeting was purely personal. “I don’t think he was trying to say anything in particular,” Mr. Grassi said. “He was just meeting with his ex-student and a very close friend of his.”
Late on Friday, the Vatican confirmed the meeting. “Mr. Yayo Grassi, a former Argentine student of Pope Francis, who had already met other times in the past with the pope, asked to present his mother and several friends to the Pope during the Pope’s stay in Washington, D.C.,” Father Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said in a statement.
“As noted in the past, the pope, as pastor, has maintained many personal relationships with people in a spirit of kindness, welcome and dialogue,” the statement added.
Earlier on Friday, the Vatican said that Archbishop Viganò had arranged the pope’s meetings in Washington, including the one with Ms. Davis.
The news of the meeting with Ms. Davis was disclosed late Tuesday night by Ms. Davis’s lawyer, Mathew D. Staver, at the same time it was reported on the website of Inside the Vatican, a conservative publication edited by an American who has covered the Vatican for years.
For nearly eight hours, Vatican officials refused to confirm or deny that the meeting had occurred, before finally confirming it on Wednesday afternoon.
For Francis, the timing of the Davis controversy is not ideal. Beginning Sunday the Vatican is staging a critical three-week meeting of bishops and laypeople to discuss whether to recommend changing their approach to contemporary issues related to the family, like gay couples, single parents or whether divorced and remarried Catholics who have not obtained annulments should be allowed to receive communion.
That meeting, known as a synod, could become a showdown between liberals and conservatives. Francis has spent nearly two years trying to gradually build consensus and has repeatedly stated his desire for a more welcoming, merciful outreach — even as he has not signaled any willingness to change church doctrine.
News of his meeting with Ms. Davis buoyed Christian conservatives, who had been dismayed that the pope, in his emphasis on the poor, barely mentioned issues like abortion and homosexuality during his visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia. It also puzzled and angered more liberal observers.
It also led observers of the Vatican to speculate about whether the encounter with Ms. Davis was a signal of support for her cause. Francis has emphasized that he strongly believes in conscientious objection as a human right, a position he reaffirmed on his plane ride home.
On Friday, the Vatican appeared to be distancing itself from Ms. Davis’s camp. Father Lombardi’s statement said that the brief meeting “has continued to provoke comments and discussion,” and that he was providing clarification “in order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.”

The Vatican’s statement prompted reactions on both sides of the Atlantic.
In a phone interview on Friday, Mr. Staver said the meeting had been called by the Vatican.
“This was a private meeting initiated by the Vatican,” Mr. Staver said. “My contacts were Vatican officials in the United States. And I was informed the request came directly from the pontiff.”
Mr. Staver said the request had come on Sept. 14, the day Ms. Davis returned to work after her release from jail. Ms. Davis and her husband were picked up at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in a tan van by private security guards who spoke Italian, he said. She had been instructed to change her hairstyle so she would not be identified.
Mr. Staver said Ms. Davis was not among a large group of people meeting the pope. She saw no one else waiting to see the pope and no one else saw her. “Just think about it. If she was in a line, there is no way this could have been kept secret for five days,” he said.
But at the Vatican on Friday, a spokesman, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, said the invitation had been extended by the nuncio’s office — not from Rome.
“Who brought her in? The nuncio,” said Father Rosica, who is working with the Vatican’s media office in advance of a major meeting of bishops that begins this weekend. “The Nunciature was able to bring in donors, benefactors.”
Father Rosica said of the controversy: “I would simply say: Her case is a very complex case. It’s got all kinds of intricacies. Was there an opportunity to brief the pope on this beforehand? I don’t think so. A list is given — these are the people you are going to meet.”
Mr. Staver, for his part, said he had been briefly introduced to Archbishop Viganò in April, when he spoke at a large rally in Washington against same-sex marriage, before the Supreme Court ruled on the issue.
The Rev. James Martin, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, had cautioned in an article this week that the pope meets many well-wishers on his trips, and that news of the meeting with Ms. Davis had been manipulated.
“I was very disappointed to see the pope having been used that way, and that his willingness to be friendly to someone was turned against him,” Father Martin said in an interview on Friday. “What may originally have prevented them from issuing a statement was the desire not to give this story too much air. But what they eventually came to realize was that they needed to correct some gross misrepresentations of what had happened. It shows that Pope Francis met with many people on the trip, and that she was simply another person who he tried to be kind to.”
Father Rosica’s statement seemed to square with that account.
Asked on Friday if the Vatican press office had been unaware that Ms. Davis had met the pope, Father Rosica said: “No, but I think we may not have been aware of the full impact of the meeting. It is very difficult sometimes when you are looking at things in America from here.”
A receptionist who answered the phone at the Vatican Embassy in Washington on Friday said, “The nuncio does not deny that the meeting took place, but would not make any further comment.”
She said the embassy did not have its own spokesman, and that no other officials there would comment.
Archbishop Viganò is turning 75 in January, the age at which bishops must submit a formal request to the Vatican asking for permission to resign. These requests are not automatically accepted, and bishops often stay in their appointments well past age 75. But if Archbishop Viganò is held responsible for what is seen as a grave misstep on an important papal trip, he is likely to be removed at the first respectable opportunity, according to several church analysts.
“Nobody in the Catholic Church wants another Regensburg,” said Massimo Faggioli, an associate professor of theology and director of the Institute for Catholicism and Citizenship at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. He was referring to the backlash after Pope Benedict XVI, Francis’ predecessor, gave a speech in Regensburg, Germany, that appeared to denigrate Islam.
“This was not as serious as Regensburg, when Benedict read his own speech,” Dr. Faggioli said about the meeting attended by Ms. Davis. “But the pope has to be able to rely on his own system, and in this case the system failed him. The question is, was it a mistake, or was it done with full knowledge of how toxic she was?”

The grocery store terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, gave an interview to a French TV station at the height of the siege in which he swore allegiance to Islamic State and claimed the three days of mayhem had been ‘synchronised’.
Coulibaly confirmed he had shot a policewoman in the south of Paris on Thursday. ‘Them Charlie Hebdo; me the police,’ he said.
One of his hostages had left a telephone line open so police could hear what was happening in the shop and moved in when the gunman began to pray.

A 27-year-old graphic designer hid inside a box with his phone for more than six hours and updated police on his phone.
Another man, Michel Catalano, who the brothers held during the stand-off, was able to walk to safety helped by police. The terrorists had told negotiators they wanted to ‘die as martyrs’ before mounting their fatal charge.
Last night French president Francois Hollande spoke to the nation promising ‘all necessary measures will be used’ to protect the French people and called on them to remain united in ‘these difficult times’.
He said the attacks had been carried out by fanatics who had nothing to do with Islam and said the assault on the grocery shop was ‘anti-semitic’.
The country must remain vigilant against the possibility of further attacks, he stressed.
The dual assaults brought to an end France’s biggest security operation with nearly 90,000 police and soldiers deployed initially to hunt down the brothers, and then Coulibaly, after he had shot dead the 27-year-old policewoman.
Millions had watched gripped on television as the manhunt for the terrorists had ended in bloody shootouts, car chases and sieges.
At one point seven helicopters and more than 50 police and military vehicles had been involved in a high-speed chase during which shots were fired after the Kouachis broke cover from a forest where they had been sheltering 50 miles north east of Paris.
Dead: Amedey Coulibaly was shot dead after taking at least six hostages at a grocery store in east Paris. He is believed to be have been working with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene (right) who was said to be 'armed and dangerous'
Dead: Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, and his brother Said (right) were killed in a firefight with French special forces at a industrial site
Bloody climax: A huge ball of fire erupts amid gunfire and explosions as French special forces shoot dead the two Charlie Hebdo gunmen
In their sights: Police train their weapons on the building where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen were holed up with a hostage in Dammartin-en-Goele
ALGERIAN WARNING Algerian secret services warned France of an imminent attack 24 hours before the Paris atrocity, it was claimed last night. Officials told their French counterparts that a ‘major terrorist operation was in preparation on French territory’ on January 6, according to TV station iTele. The claim is particularly interesting because the Kouachi brothers behind the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices were French nationals of Algerian descent. They were radicalised by the Buttes-Chaumont jihadist recruitment cell, primarily made up of Franco-Algerians.
They were forced in to the industrial estate at Dammartin-en-Goele where they made their last stand.
Local residents were evacuated or ordered to lock themselves in their homes as what was described as ‘a small army’ of soldiers and police surrounded them, throwing a cordon around the area.
‘They said they want to die as martyrs,’ Yves Albarello, a local politician who was inside the command post, claimed.
Meanwhile, across Paris, Coulibaly, brandishing his Kalashnikov, wearing a bullet proof vest and firing at shoppers, had stormed the kosher supermarket near the Porte de Vincennes, shooting or taking hostage those inside.
Police said he was accompanied by a woman called Hayat Boumeddiene, 26. They were described as ‘armed and dangerous.’
Her fate was unknown last night amid reports that she was on the run. Unknown to the gunman, several Jewish families were hiding in a freezing store room below, listening to the gunfire and terror above.
It appeared that at one point Coulibaly and the Kouachis were in contact and police shut down all communications around the industrial site.
Coulibaly warned a hostage negotiator that if the brothers were killed, he would open fire on his hostages. One woman trapped inside telephoned her mother to say: ‘I am in the shop. I love you.’
Explosion: The street is rocked during the final stages of the siege which left four hostages dead
Front door: Officers were also seen pouring in through the front door at the denouement of the siege
Assault force: Special forces line up to enter the premises through a backdoor as the street is rocked by explosions
Police locked down the area, swamping it with hundreds of security forces. Snipers could be seen on rooftops and at windows looking for a clear shot at Coulibaly.
Last night there was a huge sense of relief in the French capital, mixed with disbelief and fears of more copycat strikes.
There were difficult questions too for the intelligence services as to why they had stopped their surveillance on the Kouachi brothers when their jihadi terror links going back eight years were so well known.
In a telephone call yesterday, Cherif Kouachi admitted he had been funded by a network loyal to Anwar al-Awlaki, the former American-born leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who was killed by a drone strike in 2011 in Yemen.
Frantic: Police rush to the scene of the hostage-taking at an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goele around 25 miles from Paris
Siege: The gunmen are surrounded by police commandos who have begun negotiations to try to secure the release of the hostage
Trapped: The brothers were cornered in the premises of a printing firm after leading police on a dramatic car chase
Scoping it out: Police and armed forces take up positions in Dammartin-en-Goele after landing by helicopter in fields near the hostage scene
Hacker group Anonymous ‘declared war’ on Islamist terrorists last night saying they would smash their online networks. The group said it would track down and close social media accounts of militants, in a video and statement published online.
A figure wearing the group’s symbolic Guy Fawkes mask appeared seated in front of a desk with the hashtag #OpCharlieHebdo.
Speaking in French and with his voice obscured electronically, he said: ‘We are declaring war against you, the terrorists.’

701514249269542912,unverified,"No, the polling doesn't prove Bernie Sanders won the Hispanic vote in Nevada https://t.co/hwF2RrrViw",http://nyti.ms/1OoooAL,True,"No, the Polling Doesn’t Prove Bernie Sanders Won the Hispanic Vote in Nevada","Clinton Won Heavily Hispanic Areas
The Hispanic vote in Nevada is overwhelmingly concentrated in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. In particular, Hispanic voters are concentrated on the east side of the city, where they make up the vast majority of the population but only a slight majority of registered Democrats. (For a rough map, see this tweet.)
In the 76 precincts in Clark County where we believe that a plurality of registered Democrats are Hispanic, Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Sanders in the delegate count by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent. In the smaller number of majority Hispanic precincts, she seemed to win about 60 percent of the delegates, and she won perhaps 65 percent of the delegates in the precincts where Hispanics appeared to be a particularly large share of registered Democrats. (For details on the estimates, see my note at the end of the article.)
Similarly, it was widely reported that Mrs. Clinton fared extremely well in the precincts along the Las Vegas Strip.
Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign press secretary, tweeted that the campaign estimated that Mrs. Clinton won 61 percent of the vote in Hispanic precincts throughout the state.
Does that prove the “entrance polls were wrong,” as Mr. Fallon said? Not on its own. It’s dangerous to infer much about the preferences of a demographic group based on the results of the areas where they live. Hispanic voters who live in majority Hispanic areas might be particularly likely to support Mrs. Clinton. In other words, focusing only on the places where Hispanic voters are most prevalent could provide a misleading picture of Hispanic voters over all. We know that this is an issue in other contexts: Similar analysis would overestimate the Democratic share of the vote among Hispanic voters, or the Republican vote among white voters.
A Democratic pollster unaffiliated with either campaign said that Mr. Sanders does better among nonwhite voters in areas where whites represent a larger share of the population, which would suggest that a precinct-based analysis would understate Mr. Sanders’s strength.
There’s another problem: There were relatively few homogeneous precincts, where almost all of the voters are Hispanic. Even the majority Hispanic precincts in Nevada have large numbers of non-Hispanic voters, who themselves could have been likelier to support Mrs. Clinton (though the findings still hold if one excludes the precincts where there appear to be an above-average number of black voters, who favored Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin).
But it is a stretch to say that Mr. Sanders could have done so well among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas that he overcame a deficit in relatively Hispanic areas, where a large proportion of the Hispanic population lives.
These Polls Are Hardly Perfect
Precinct data isn’t perfect. But I would take it over this entrance/exit poll.
In general, entrance/exit polls are not well suited to measure the Hispanic vote. This one is particularly problematic.
Over all, the poll included just 1,024 respondents — and just 213 Hispanic respondents. In a normal poll, that would imply a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.
But these types of polls are not normal. The margin of error is even higher, at 7 percent, and the true error can easily be much higher.
That’s because an entrance-exit poll isn’t a random sample of the population like a normal poll. It’s a random sample of precincts, usually between 15 and 60 in a state exit poll. This one had just 25 precincts. Race is not usually used as a criteria for selecting precincts.
Precinct selection introduces a whole new dimension of error into an entrance-exit poll for Hispanic voters, or any demographic group that’s concentrated in small areas. The 25 precincts could overrepresent an unrepresented group — imagine if a New York exit poll, by chance, included two Orthodox Jewish precincts in Brooklyn and showed a Republican ahead among Jewish voters — or completely miss a small, geographically concentrated group.

You can imagine how this could wind up creating the opposite risk of the precinct analysis: What if the entrance-exit poll simply doesn’t include a heavily Hispanic precinct where Mrs. Clinton excelled? The danger is real with a sample as small as this, especially in a highly diverse state.
This type of problem is responsible for one of the biggest exit poll controversies in memory: the finding that 44 percent of Hispanic voters supported George W. Bush in 2004. Simply by chance, 3 of the 11 plurality Hispanic precincts were in Miami-Dade County, where Hispanic voters are particularly conservative. The 44 percent finding was four points higher than the result from a compilation of the 50 state exit polls — a difference well outside the formal “margin of error” for a sample of that size.
The exit pollsters are upfront about the issue, as they acknowledged in the exit poll’s postelection analysis in 2004:
“A National Sample of 250 precincts can do a good job estimating all of the broad characteristics of the electorate, but it is not designed to yield very reliable estimates of the characteristics of small, geographically clustered demographic groups. [...] If we want to improve the National Exit Poll estimate for Hispanic vote (or Asian vote, Jewish vote or Mormon vote etc.) we would either need to drastically increase the number of precincts in the National Sample or oversample the number of Hispanic precincts.”
And that’s for a national exit poll of 10 times as many precincts as the one in Nevada.
The exit polls have also been criticized for other issues measuring Hispanic voters, like whether pollsters conduct Spanish-language interviews. They generally do not, although Spanish-language questionnaires are typically offered in Nevada and other states with large Hispanic populations.
In a December interview, Joe Lenski, who runs the exit polls for Edison Research, acknowledged that exit polls “are not the precise measurement of demographics that people would want them to be.” He said that he “cringes” when people say “Oh, that’s the number” and run with it as “absolute truths or precise numbers.”
Referring specifically to the Nevada results, Mr. Lenski added that there are additional errors with caucus and entrance polls. The entrance poll measures initial preferences — those can change at the caucus, and uncommitted is an option that received 3 percent support in initial preference. The delegate tallies don’t necessarily line up with actual vote counts, either; the delegates are allocated only after candidates get 15 percent of the vote. In other words, a candidate could win 60 percent of the delegates without winning 60 percent of the vote.
There were signs of problems Saturday in poll results themselves. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were tied in the initial entrance-exit poll estimates; she ultimately won by around 5.5 points. Clearly the entrance polls missed Mrs. Clinton’s strength somewhere.
Is it possible that the precincts missed Mrs. Clinton’s strength among Hispanic voters in Clark County? Quite possibly. Even the final entrance-exit poll numbers show Mrs. Clinton leading in Clark County by just 5 points; she actually won there by 10 points.
A Clinton Win, but Not a Landslide
It’s tough to give a poll subsample of some 200 respondents much weight, especially when it’s for a clustered group like Hispanics.
It’s even harder to give it credit when there’s so much reason to wonder whether it’s right. Mrs. Clinton fared well in majority Hispanic precincts. National polls show Mrs. Clinton faring well among Hispanic voters — and Mr. Sanders basically finished in line with national polls among both white and black voters.
All evidence considered, and although we can’t know for sure, I’d err on the side of a Clinton win among Hispanic voters.
But it would be hard to argue that she won Hispanic voters by a lot. Sixty percentage points could easily be too high if she indeed fared better among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas. The entrance-exit poll result may not be perfect, but it certainly seems consistent with this possibility. If I had to bet, I’d say she won Hispanic voters by a somewhat more modest margin.
It would still imply that Mr. Sanders made big gains over the last month. But it would still be short of what he would need to overcome Mrs. Clinton’s vast strength among black voters. She won them by a huge margin, whether you look at the entrance-exit polling or majority black precincts.

In assessing delegate counts, the estimates used are not perfect.

662430295254175744,false,#OpKKK releases 500+ names and reveals unexpected #PlotTwist https://t.co/hPUWXVXrzP https://t.co/VHENnzwveh,http://thecryptosphere.com/2015/11/05/hoodsoff-opkkk-releases-500-names-anonymous-identifies-as-kkk-members/,True,"#HoodsOff, #OpKKK Releases 500+ Names #Anonymous Identifies as KKK Members","Well, it’s finally here: the long-awaited list that Anonymous’s OpKKK has been collating for a year, since the first OpKKK which grew out of OpFerguson, which itself came into being over the apparently racially-based shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. The KKK decided to get involved, to “protect” the people of Ferguson, which is 67.4% African-American. Anonymous collectively got in their faces, literally in the case of videographer Alex Poucher, who invited Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, to a sit-down interview at a diner, frequently masked man to frequently masked man, masks off.
That video has been viewed over 440,000 times.
OpKKK was born on Friday, the 14th of November, 2014, in response to KKK flyers threatening protesters with “lethal violence.” As we reported at the time:
The outcome was relatively predictable, as everynewsoutlet on the planet has alreadyreportedwhile I was offline. Anonymous took the KKK site offline, and doxed its members in and around the StLouis/Ferguson area via #, while simultaneously seizing control of a central KKK twitter account.
Well, turned out that “KKK twitter account” was a false flag, and a highly effective one: it was a straw man fake KKK account set up by Anonymous, built up over time, and then, at the right moment, “seized” by Anonymous. Propaganda wars are so interesting, aren’t they?
Anonymous also embarrassed several police officers by revealing their ties to the racist organization, Cabin Cr3w style.
This year, what’s new? About 500 new names released, an embarassing KKK predeliction for the nearly-dead Google Plus social platform revealed, and the side-note of a very interesting list of members of the KKK who are also associated with the FBI. Whether that confluence is an expression of political support and exercise of the right of freedom of association, or for the purposes of surveillance and information, is as yet unclear.
But since those names are now public, we might as well just, you know, Ask them.
The official pastebin release (better download, it’s sure to be gone soon; the pastes from last year were removed promptly) has a lengthy introduction which discusses everything from the taxonomy of the KKK to the implications of one masked group outing another and how a Kantian ethical approach justifies OpKKK. Here’s a slightly edited (for length) excerpt of the most important parts of the intro.
Where to Start? The basics. The Ku Klux Klan has approximately 150 active cells, operating in 41 states, with membership concentrated in both the South and the Midwest. At its peak, membership was in the millions. Now, membership is likely less than 5,000. It is very important to understand – the KKK does not have a central unified leadership. Instead, they are split off into local cells or groups. These groups generally oppose interracial relationships, homosexuality and illegal immigration and historically express this ideology through acts of terror. We want to remind you: This operation is not about the ideas of members of the Ku Klux Klan. This is about the behaviors of members of KKK splinter cells that bear the hallmarks of terrorism. When members of the KKK like Frazier Glenn Miller, (founder of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party) murdered three innocent individuals at a Jewish retirement home during Passover – the word “terrorism” was seldom found in mainstream media’s coverage of the attack. Why? What sort of violence does it take to call *some* factions of Ku Klux Klan what *some* of these cells really are? We defend free thought and free speech. The anons responsible for this operation will not support *acts* of terrorism and *acts* of hate inflicted upon the public. The KKK is part of an important cultural landscape and history in the United States. We need to make room for important, blunt, honest, public, productive conversation. Violent bigotry IS a problem in the United States. This is not a colorblind society. It deeply divided on racial lines. We hope Operation KKK will, in part, spark a bit of constructive dialogue about race, racism, racial terror and freedom of expression, across group lines. In this dox list, you will find official members of various KKK groups throughout the United States as well as their closest associates (most are also in other extremist hate groups). The klan sometimes hides behind several online identities. Given name or alias, these are the real people underneath the hoods. Data collected for Operation KKK was gathered over approximately 11 months and those included on this list were identified primarily through HUMINT (human intelligence) data collection strategies. This means that individuals on this list were often identified by human sources of information through both overt (interviewing expert sources) and covert (digital espionage / social engineering) methods. Individuals on our list were also identified through open source intelligence strategies (OSINT). This is a broad array of information and sources that are generally available to the public. This includes: multimedia, academic records and public data. Members often told on themselves to us about their connections with the KKK during various chat conversations we had with klan members and affiliates throughout the course of our operation. You never know who you are talking to on the internet. We understand this initiative is extremely controversial and we know we will face much criticism for this operation and our work will be heavily scrutinized. We hope this body of work speaks for itself. This is the OFFICIAL Operation KKK 2015 intel report associated with the @Operation_KKK Twitter account. The anons at @Operation_KKK are responsible for this specific liberation of information and we have done our best to ensure accuracy and avoid collateral damage to innocent parties. Erring on the side of caution, we removed several names from this list for further evaluation. We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.

You can see on the paste itself the note that it has been edited: only the original poster, or someone with access to that account, can do that, so edits are deemed “official” in as much as anything can be official which originates with a faceless hive mind.
A digression:
Last year, the world (particularly the media world) eagerly awaited the release of the Anonymous dox of the officer who shot Michael Brown. At that time, a dox was released, quickly disavowed by the Anons working on OpFerguson, which incorrectly identified the police officer. The named subject had to go into hiding, but had nothing to do with Brown’s death. Media coverage of the dox and the fallout when it was found to be false, was massive.
That “faildox” dissipated a significant amount of public faith in Anonymous, and stalled the media momentum for OpFerguson, which then had to spend almost as much energy apologizing and clarifying as it did researching.
This year, a similar event occurred with OpKKK, and surprise, surprise, the same account is involved: then called TheAnonMessage, now known as TheAnonMessages, it remains, for some reason, a favourite with the mainstream media. It has been quoted in Business Insider on a Pirate Bay conspiracy theory, Huffington Post, Forbes, Time magazine (where this reporter was quoted refuting it), and many other outlets. It continues to be quoted despite the fact that as you can see from those links, many of those articles had to be amended afterwards when it turned out the information was false. Its reach is remarkable, moreso when considered against its record of faildoxing days before the real releases come out, repudiation by reputable Anonymous accounts whose operations have been thus pipped at the post, and failed singlehanded operations, as with its operation against Iggy Azalea.
There was also his fake suicide, and the time he pretended ISIS had taken over his Twitter account.
Please, media brethren and sistren, JUST STOP.

Back on-topic, this year there was even more chaos in the mix, as a lone hacker, Amped Attacks, released his own list of KKK members, independent of Anonymous and specifically refuting any link.

What it looks like at the Republican National Convention on Day 3
What it looks like at the Republican National Convention on Day 3
Donald Trump’s campaign has tried to use this week’s Republican National Convention to court African Americans by arguing that President Obama has failed them on jobs and crime. But when the GOP presidential nominee delivers his acceptance speech here Thursday, he will address an estimated 18 blacks out of 2,472 delegates.
Although that handful includes some of Trump’s most vociferous backers, the overall lack of ethnic diversity at the convention illustrates one of his greatest challenges: how to court black voters after four decades of controversy over his racial views, including campaign-trail rhetoric that has alienated many minorities.
Twelve years ago, the GOP seemed on its way toward broadening its base, boasting 167 black delegates at its convention. That year, President George W. Bush drew 16 percent of the black vote here in Ohio, unusually high for a Republican, to help secure his reelection, as well as 11 percent nationally, and party leaders had hoped to increase minority engagement in 2016.
But as Trump heads to the general election, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found Democrat Hillary Clinton leading Trump among blacks by 89 percent to 4 percent, and a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll said Trump has zero support among African Americans in Ohio.
That is frustrating to the black delegates here, several of whom said in interviews that Trump has a compelling case to make to African Americans.

“The rest of America has to see the person I sat down with,” said James Evans, the chairman of the Utah Republican Party, who last month met privately with Trump after unsuccessfully trying to draft Mitt Romney to seek the nomination. “The Democratic playbook is that if you are a white Republican candidate, you are a racially insensitive candidate. Let’s look at the policies of the political left and how they devastated the black community, and you tell me who is more racist.”
Bruce LeVell, a delegate who heads Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, said he faces discrimination as a Trump supporter. “To be a black American in Georgia, and to be a Republican and to be for Trump, I can’t even tell you all the things I’ve been called,” he said.
Trump’s outlook on race has come under new scrutiny in recent days as he has stepped up his criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement, saying it is “very divisive.” He asserted that after a black man shot five white police officers in Dallas before being killed, adding, “I have seen, you know, moments of silence called for . . . this horrible human being.” The assertion came despite the fact that leaders of Black Lives Matter condemned the killing of police officers.
Trump has vowed that he would unify the races as president.
“I am not a racist,” he told The Washington Post in an interview earlier this year. “I’m the least racist person that you’ve ever interviewed.”
Trump, however, faces many challenges in winning over black voters, in part because he has been at the center of controversies regarding his racial views for decades.
The first front-page news story about Trump was a 1973 report about the federal government’s lawsuit against him and his father in a racial bias case. Trump denied discriminating against black housing applicants and settled the case without admitting guilt.

Several years later, after Trump had expanded his real estate empire by building casinos in Atlantic City, a former executive from his business accused him of making racist statements. John O’Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and later wrote a memoir about his experience, said Trump blamed financial difficulties partly on African American accountants.
“I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza — black guys counting my money!” O’Donnell’s book quoted Trump as saying. “I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. Those are the kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else. . . . Besides that, I’ve got to tell you something else. I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is; I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”
O’Donnell said in an interview that he admonished Trump not to talk that way.
“You’re sitting there listening to him talk in stereotypes about black people being lazy and that it was a trait in his mind. And you just go, ‘Oh my God,’ ” O’Donnell said.
Trump told Playboy magazine that O’Donnell’s memoir was “probably true.” He told The Post earlier this year that the book was “fiction,” although he hadn’t read it. Trump said he fired O’Donnell, but O’Donnell said he quit.
In 1989, Trump inserted himself into a racially charged case in New York City. Five boys, four black and one Hispanic, ages 14 to 16, had been arrested for the brutal attack and rape of a woman who had been jogging in Central Park. Two weeks later, Trump paid for a full-page ad in four New York newspapers urging the return of the death penalty and warning of “roving bands of wild criminals.”
The jogger suffered permanent damage. The boys were convicted and served six to 13 years in prison. But years later, a career criminal confessed to the rape, providing a DNA match. The convictions were overturned, and the city paid $41 million to settle a wrongful-imprisonment suit that the men had filed. Trump called the settlement “a disgrace,” refused to apologize, and said, “These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.”
A few months after the Central Park incident, Trump appeared on an NBC-TV special called “Racial Attitudes and Consciousness Exam,” hosted by Bryant Gumbel. He appeared to criticize affirmative action.
“A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market,” Trump said on the program. “I think sometimes a black may think they don’t have an advantage or this and that. I’ve said on one occasion, even about myself, if I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black, because I believe they do have an actual advantage.”
During Trump’s time as the star of his reality show, “The Apprentice,” he worked with a number of African American contestants.
Kwame Jackson, a Harvard Business School graduate who was on the first season of the show, said he saw the “Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde” nature of Trump. During the taping of the show, Jackson said, Trump was respectful and Jackson didn’t think of him as racist. But when Trump became a leading voice of the “birther” movement and questioned whether Obama was born in the United States, and then spoke critically of Mexicans and Muslims, Jackson said he sadly came to a different conclusion.
“People thought he is flirting with racism, or manipulating American anger, then it became pure racism,” he said. “My distance [with Trump] grew to true disdain.”
In November, Trump drew criticism when he retweeted a tweet that said blacks killed 81 percent of white homicide victims. The claim quickly was shown to be false. The actual number was 15 percent; 82 percent of whites were killed by whites.
The number of black delegates was disclosed last month in a Republican Party email reported by Post columnist Jonathan Capehart. A party official did not respond this week to a request for comment.
Trump declined an invitation to speak to the NAACP’s annual convention, which was held in Cincinnati this week. The civil rights organization said Trump’s campaign cited a scheduling conflict with the Republican convention.
Although only a handful of African American delegates are at this week’s convention, a number of blacks have been given prominent speaking roles, On Monday night, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., who has called Black Lives Matter a “hate group,” praised Trump as “the steadfast leader our nation needs.”
Trump, meanwhile, said in the interview earlier this year that his candidacy would be best for African Americans.
“Somebody said Make America Great Again is a very negative theme,” he said. “I said, ‘No, it’s a very positive theme because people have been disenfranchised.’ Look at African Americans. I mean, I’m going to be so great. I think I’m going to do great with African Americans.”",9695

692014905239666688,non-rumor,Danish lawmakers approve bill allowing seizure of asylum seekers' valuables to help cover expenses. https://t.co/AxmIacbHzc,http://cnn.it/2016y2T,True,Denmark adopts law approving seizure of migrant assets,"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) Danish lawmakers voted Tuesday in favor of controversial legislation empowering authorities to seize cash and valuables from asylum seekers to help cover their expenses.
The law was passed in parliament by 81 votes to 27, with one abstention.
The passing of the so-called jewelry bill allows the seizure of valuables worth more than 10,000 Danish kroner (about $1,453).
Items of ""special sentimental value"" such as ""wedding rings, engagement rings, family portraits, decorations and medals"" are exempted, according to the Danish Ministry of Immigration, Integration and Housing. But ""watches, mobile phones and computers"" can be confiscated, it says.
The legislation has been criticized across the political spectrum, appalling many in this northern European nation, which has a longstanding global reputation for tolerance and promoting liberal, social democratic values.
Rights group Amnesty International slammed the law, saying in a statement that it reflected a ""dismal race to the bottom"" by European countries in response to the migrant crisis.
""To prolong the suffering of vulnerable people who have been ripped apart from their families by conflict or persecution is plain wrong,"" John Dalhuisen, the group's Europe and Central Asia director, said in a statement.
""Today's meanspirited vote in Danish parliament seeks not only to pilfer the possessions refugees cling to, but also to needlessly lengthen their separation from their loved ones.""
A fair deal, says government
Denmark's ruling Liberal Party says the legislation is about ensuring that asylum seekers contribute to the country's generous welfare state.

""All Danish citizens and refugees coming here receive universal health care; you receive education from preschool to university, and you receive elderly care; you receive language training and integration training free of charge, paid for by the government,"" Liberal Party spokesman Jakob Ellemann-Jensen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month
""The only demand that we set to measure this is if you have the means to pay for your housing and for your food -- regardless of whether you are a Dane or whether you are a refugee -- then you should.""
Similar laws exist in Switzerland and Germany, according to officials there. Dozens of cases were reported in Switzerland of migrants' assets being confiscated to fund their living expenses, although in Germany it was unclear if, or how widely, the policy was enforced.
Deterring migrants
But others -- both backers and critics of the law -- say it has more to do with deterring further arrivals of migrants and asylum seekers who have entered Europe in numbers not seen since World War II.
JUST WATCHED Denmark migrant bill would discourage refugees Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Denmark migrant bill would discourage refugees 02:08
""We hope this will start a chain reaction through Europe where other European countries can see there's the need to tighten the rules on immigration in order to keep European culture,"" said Martin Henriksen, spokesman for the right-wing Danish People's Party, which supports the law.
Lawmakers also voted to triple the period of time before asylum seekers can apply for separated family members to be reunited with them in Denmark.
That measure, which extends the period from one year to three, is expected to have an even greater deterrent effect on potential migrants.
""The aim is to make sure that (fewer) people come to Denmark, if it's hard to bring your family,"" Henriksen said.
Migrant mother deterred
One Syrian migrant in Denmark who spoke to CNN said she had no intention of remaining in the country because of the requirement, which would see her wait years to apply for her 9-year-old daughter, still in Syria , to rejoin her.
""Sometimes I say to my friends, I'm scared that if I die here, my daughter won't know where her mother is buried,"" she said.
Anders Ladekarl, secretary general of the Danish Red Cross, called the law ""really disturbing.""
""Imagine leaving your family back home in a war zone, and you will have to sit in a Danish village or refugee center waiting for your family without being able to see them for three to four years,"" he said.
'An affront to dignity'
Many in socially liberal Denmark say they are appalled by the law, which the U.N. Refugee Agency has called ""an affront to (refugees') dignity and an arbitrary interference with their right to privacy.""
Wiebke Keson, a 72-year-old Danish refugee center volunteer, said she was ""shocked"" by the notion of confiscating jewelry.
""Since I'm German, I was immediately thinking about our own history,"" she said, voicing a common criticism that the policy echoes Nazi confiscations of Jewish valuables.
Hardening attitudes
But the policy reflects a hardening of attitudes toward migrants across Scandinavia -- and Europe in general -- in the face of a historic influx of immigrants hailing predominantly from the Muslim world, many fleeing the war in Syria
Sweden and Germany are regarded as the most desirable final destinations for most of the more than 1 million migrants who entered Europe last year , and both countries have proved the most hospitable to new arrivals.
JUST WATCHED Refugee center worker stabbed to death in Sweden Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Refugee center worker stabbed to death in Sweden 01:43
But the ever-growing numbers of asylum seekers, combined with high-profile crimes blamed on migrants, have made the host populations wary and have gradually fed rising anti-migrant sentiment.
It's not only Denmark that has brought in tougher policies on migrants. In November, Sweden introduced tighter border controls and asylum rules to reduce the number of asylum seekers entering the country. And last week, Norway began deportations of migrants who had entered via a border with Russia
'It's impossible to integrate that number of people'
Anti-immigration parties have also received more support. In Sweden, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party has soared in popularity, polling at about 20% in recent polls . Before 2010, the party had not won a single seat in the country's parliament.
Markus Wiechel, a parliament member for the Sweden Democrats who is the party's migration spokesman, says his party's fortunes rocketed over the past year as the effects of the migrant crisis appeared on Swedish society.
""Last year we received more than 170,000 asylum seekers in one year -- that's in a country with about 9.5 million people. Of course it's impossible to integrate that number of people in our society,"" he said.
The new arrivals placed an economic strain on Sweden's welfare system, he said, and disrupted the Swedish way of life. He said many Swedes felt ""insecure"" because of what he called increased violence and a rising Islamist threat, which he blamed on the new arrivals.
""We have to understand they have different ways of looking at life, they come from different cultures. They don't think the same,"" he said.
Blowback from Paris, Cologne
More than 900 people reported being attacked by men of North African or Arab appearance during New Year's Eve festivities in Cologne, 523 of them reporting having been sexually assaulted. Similar attacks were reported in cities across Europe, including in Sweden and Finland.
Many believed that authorities and the media had been slow to acknowledge the crimes in Cologne out of a misguided sense of political correctness. After the attacks, allegations emerged that authorities had covered up a similar wave of sexual offenses by migrants at a 2014 music festival in Stockholm, Sweden . The city's police ordered an investigation of the allegations.
'We are still a very generous people'
For Ladekarl, of the Danish Red Cross, the Danish law, like similar policies aimed at curbing immigration, represents European countries pulling up the drawbridge.
Suppressing liberal Scandinavian principles of social justice and adopting hard-line policies toward migrants is unlikely to be successful, he said.
""There (is) no attempt to find a common European solution to this,"" he told CNN.
""Every country is now trying to fence themselves in, trying to scare refugees and asylum seekers away. And this is not going to work in the long run because we have a lot of people in need of international protection, and they're being pushed from one country to the other.""
But for growing numbers of the political class in Scandinavian countries, the adoption of tougher rules toward migrants doesn't represent the abandonment of traditional values, but is a reflection of the new challenge they face.
They have already done their share, they say.
""We need to be able to control what is going on with the people coming to Denmark,"" Ellemann-Jensen, the Denmark Liberal Party spokesman, told CNN last month.
""Therefore, we are passing legislation that, yes, tightens up a bit.
""But we are still a very generous people (compared) to almost the rest of the world.""
Wiechel, of the Sweden Democrats, agreed, saying the Scandinavian country remained a progressive society.
""We're still an open and tolerant country. The problem is the number of asylum seekers has never been this high. This affects the way society works,"" he said.",9431
715268937873760256,unverified,"Donald Trump goes full anti-woman: ""punishment"" for women who abort https://t.co/jy0cb52s5Z https://t.co/5MEznuWVi1",http://huff.to/1TjayHg,True,"Donald Trump Goes Full Anti-Woman, Suggests 'Punishment' For Women Who Abort","APPLETON, Wis. -- Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Wednesday that there ""has to be some form of punishment"" for abortion if it were banned in the U.S. -- as he says it should be -- and that punishment should fall on the woman.
Trump, who is currently struggling with women voters, was pressed on the issue of abortion during an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, set to air Wednesday evening.
Matthews asked whether abortion should be punished, and Trump initially skated around the issue. He said some Republicans would say it should be, and that he ""would say it’s a very serious problem and it’s a problem we have to decide on.""
He then asked Matthews -- but didn't answer himself -- ""Are you going to, say, put them to jail?"" and added he was anti-abortion and that ""you have to ban"" abortion.
""There has to be some form of punishment,"" Trump said, adding ""Yeah"" when Matthews asked if he meant for the woman. The host asked if that punishment would be closer to 10 days or 10 years, and Trump said he didn't know.
Trump indicated he would be far more lenient on the man who impregnated a woman who had an abortion -- he said he did not think they would bear the same level of responsibility.
The Trump campaign quickly tried to walk back his comments afterward, saying the matter should be decided by the states. Later, Trump put out a statement that said his position was unchanged, but contradicted his past statements entirely:
If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed -- like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.
Most women who spoke with The Huffington Post at Trump's town hall in Appleton, Wisconsin, on Wednesday said they did not agree that women should be held criminally liable if they had an abortion. But Trump's initial position did not seem to weigh heavily on their support of the real estate mogul, whom they unanimously described in positive terms as a good family man who would be good for women if elected president.
""No,"" said Appleton resident Sarah Schnell, when asked if she agreed with Trump on the matter. ""And I'm pro-life. But I think that that's something that's going to have to be decided between a woman and God. I don't think that's right, I'm against it, but I don't go as far as saying the government should get involved in it.""
Cathy Smith, a caretaker of people with disabilities in nearby Freemont, said ""a woman should be able to do whatever she wants.""
Lucy Deboard, a sanitarian who recently moved to Wisconsin from New Jersey, said she didn't agree with Trump. But, she added, the issue of abortion was far down on the totem pole when compared to national security.
""I don't vote based on abortions. I think there's more important things,"" said Deboard, who described herself as pro-choice. ""Look, if ISIS comes over and kills us, I'm not real concerned with abortions. There's more important things to deal with here. We're way beyond abortions here. If you want abortion, you can go get one. I guess I'm pro-choice, but I'm not strong. Like I said, I have more important issues I'm concerned about.""
Lynn Paulus, an Oshkosh resident who described herself as pro-life ""to a point,"" also sounded her disagreement with Trump.
""If there is a woman that has been raped, I believe in exceptions. No, I don't believe in holding them criminally liable,"" Paulus added.
Debra Lynn, an esthetician from Green Bay, put her objection in Biblical terms.
""If they're not punished on Earth, they'll be punished in the long run,"" she said.
Abortion bans supported by Republicans usually make it a crime for doctors to perform the procedure, rather than for patients to obtain it.
Trump has been slippery on his stances on abortion, as with many other issues. He previously said he was in favor of abortion rights and “very pro-choice,” before changing his stance. He said he would defund Planned Parenthood, and yet offered a defense of its other services.
Republicans opposed to abortion rights already punish patients who seek the procedure, so Trump was just making their philosophy more explicit. A record number of restrictions on abortion have been passed since Republicans swept control in a slew of state legislatures in 2010; many of these provisions are meant to dissuade patients from seeking abortions and punish them if they do.
Requiring a patient undergo a waiting period of 24, 48 or 72 hours before having an abortion is a form of punishment. Banning telemedicine for medication abortion punishes patients in rural areas. Requiring an ultrasound in which the provider describes the details of the fetus to the patient is a form of punishment. Mandating biased counseling, in which doctors are required to tell patients that abortion causes breast cancer or depression, is a form of punishment.
Forcing providers to use an outdated regimen for administering medication abortions, which carries a higher risk of side-effects, is a form of punishment. Laws preventing providers from using the method used in the vast majority of second-trimester abortions, because it is the safest, punish patients. And requiring adolescents to get permission from both of their parents to have the procedure, while mandating abstinence-based sex education at the same time, punishes teens for getting pregnant.
Lastly, the Hyde Amendment, which is routinely inserted into appropriations bills, punishes low-income patients by preventing Medicaid from covering the procedure.
""I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the … Medicaid bill,” said former Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) during debate over Medicaid funding for abortion in 1977.
Trump has a long history of anti-woman comments, and this month has come under fire for his treatment of opponent Sen. Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and for sticking by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after he was charged with battery against a female reporter.
Reuters found earlier this month that half of all women have a “very unfavorable” view of the GOP front-runner.
Just 19 percent of Americans believe abortion should be illegal under all circumstances, according to Gallup, so Democrats and reproductive rights groups are guaranteed to seize upon Trump’s comments to argue that the Republican Party is out of step with public opinion on the issue.
Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) quickly responded on Twitter.
Just when you thought it couldn't get worse. Horrific and telling. -H https://t.co/Qi8TutsOw9 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016
Your Republican frontrunner, ladies and gentlemen. Shameful. https://t.co/y49Z8YfRgV — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 30, 2016
Republican candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich told NBC's Chuck Todd that there should ""absolutely not"" be punishments for a woman if abortion was outlawed. He also said he would support outlawing the procedure, with exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or women whose lives were in danger.
""Of course, women shouldn't be punished,"" he said. ""Probably Donald Trump will figure out a way to say that he didn't say it or it was misquoted or whatever, but I don't think so. I don't think that's an appropriate response.""
""And it's a difficult enough situation, and to try to punish somebody,"" he added, trailing off.
Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, released a statement saying Donald Trump obviously ""wants to ban abortion, criminalize doctors, and is threatening women.""
“But let’s be clear: Donald Trump has said it, Ted Cruz has voted for it, and John Kasich has enacted it. The Republican Party’s leadership has been waging a full-out assault on access to reproductive health care,"" she said, adding, ""The more these Republican candidates show their true beliefs, the more voters they alienate.”
Trump's words didn't go over well with the head of one of the largest anti-abortion groups, either. Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, issued a statement calling the comment ""completely out of touch with the pro-life movement and even more with women who have chosen such a sad thing as abortion.""
""Being pro-life means wanting what is best for the mother and the baby,"" she said. ""Women who choose abortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision. No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about. We invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment.""
This story has been updated to include Trump's later statement, comments from his supporters at a town hall, and comments from Laguens.

653432261203750912,unverified,Why Drunk Vegetarians Eat Meat http://t.co/opLPq0nxiX via @thedailybeast,http://thebea.st/1ji3UCz,True,Why Drunk Vegetarians Eat Meat,"On any given day, how much meat does the average vegetarian eat? Since vegetarians, by definition, don’t eat meat, this question should be boring because of course the answer is zero. This question isn’t boring at all, though, because it has a very specific, very not-zero answer—83.2 grams, about one standard serving.
With this in mind, it’s not so surprising that a recent survey shows that one third of vegetarians eat meat while they’re drunk.
This first figure—seriously, the average vegetarian in the U.S. eats one serving of meat per day!—comes from a 2003 analysis of data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the late 90’s. The researchers examined responses from a representative sample of nearly 10,000 Americans who had detailed everything they ate over two separate and nonconsecutive 24-hour periods. And vegetarians, it turns out, eat meat. About 40 percent of what the typical American reported—220 grams or so—but meat all the same.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that every vegetarian eats meat, since this figure is only an average, but most vegetarians in the U.S. do. Another survey from the USDA, also conducted by phone, put the number of vegetarians who’ve eaten meat in the last day at about two-thirds. Based on a 1995 survey of wealthy, well-educated Americans from the East Coast, only 1.5 percent said they never eat poultry or fish, but 7 percent called themselves vegetarians. Surveys by Canada’s National Institute of Nutrition put the number of Canadian vegetarians who eat chicken at about 60 percent and red meat at about 32 percent.
The survey suggesting that vegetarians eat meat while they’re drunk is a bit less rigorous—it’s based on a survey conducted by a U.K.-based coupon company, VoucherCodesPro, who hasn’t publicly released any methods or details about the subjects involved—but it’s plausible. I did exchange emails with a member of the PR firm that represents VoucherCodesPro, but they preferred not to be named and gave me a rough description of the methodology. In any case, these results should be taken with some healthy skepticism.
If anything, it’s suspicious that so few vegetarians cop to eating meat while wasted, since twice as many admit to eating meat on any given day. So whether or not this survey is accurate, it still raises interesting questions.
To help understand what’s going on, I spoke with Hank Rothgerber, a social psychologist at Bellarmine University whose research has touched on vegetarians and how they’re viewed. Rothgerber suggested that much of what’s happening might involve the reasons people are vegetarians to begin with.
“Probably a greater percent of those who have fallen off the wagon are health vegetarians,” Rothgerber suggested. “Ethical vegetarians tend to have more reasons for why they’re avoiding meat and why they don’t eat meat in the first place and probably have a stronger commitment to it.”
“If you’re a health vegetarian,” Rothgerber went on, “it’s just a matter of self-control or self-regulation. It would be the same as anyone who is trying to eat a healthy diet.” In this sense, it’s hardly surprising that vegetarians who avoid meat for health reasons stray sometimes—no more surprising, at least, than hearing that most people on a diet sometimes eat cake, especially while drunk.
Some research on lapsed vegetarians supports this. Faunalytics (formerly the Humane Research Council) conducted a survey on 11,000 American adults, which found that there are five times as many ex-vegans and vegetarians as there are current ones. About 60 percent of them said that the reason they were vegetarian in the first place was for the health benefits. In this frame, lapsed vegetarians are no more extraordinary than lapsed dieters.
But there are people who are vegetarians and vegans for ethical reasons and who still occasionally eat meat. (Full disclosure: I’m a vegan for ethical reasons and very rarely eat meat, almost exclusively while drunk). Here, so long as you exclude those who sometimes eat things like oysters since they have no nervous systems and can be farmed sustainably and are basically for all intents and purposes meat plants (thus most of my sober meat consumption), the reason for lapsing seems equally mundane: some vegetarians like the taste of meat, and we sometimes do things we want to do even when we know we shouldn’t.
Here, one of Rothgerber’s studies makes the difference between strict vegetarians and those who sometimes stray even clearer: he found that those who never cheat on their diets were more disgusted by meat, and found meat less appetizing, than those who sometimes cheated. It turns out it’s easier not to eat meat if you don’t want to.

“I think part of the problem that vegetarians face is the fact that we live in a meat eating world, at least Western societies are meat eating societies, so there’s not a lot of social support,” Rothgerber told me. “I think to some degree vegetarians who find themselves situated in other groups and social networks with like minded folks are much more likely to continue with the diet,” he went on. “I think that’s part of what makes it difficult, it’s very much the social aspect. I would guess that’s a much bigger factor than ‘I miss meat too much’ or ‘I just found it too difficult.’
Faunalytic’s survey on ex-vegetarians supports this broader point. When they explained why they stopped being vegetarian, few people said they changed their minds about animal ethics. Instead they cited more mundane reasons—almost two-thirds said they didn’t like sticking out, about half said they found it too hard to keep such a “pure” diet, and about a third noted that their significant others ate meat.
It’s these other factors, less the moral ones, that seem to matter most when it comes to getting people to follow through on their vegetarian diets. Eric Schwitzgebel, a philosopher who often studies the views of other philosophers, has helped demonstrate how sometimes the ethical argument isn’t the most important path to different eating habits: moral philosophers are more likely than other philosophers to say that eating meat is wrong, but no more likely to actually eat less meat.
In his 2006 book The Happiness Hypothesis, the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt described two experiences he had in graduate school which also demonstrate some of the limits of our moral beliefs. First, he describes how a book written by the moral philosopher Peter Singer affected him.
“Singer’s clear and compelling arguments convinced me on the spot, and since that day I have been morally opposed to all forms of factory farming. Morally opposed, but not behaviorally opposed,” Haidt wrote. “I love the taste of meat, and the only thing that changed in the first six months after reading Singer is that I thought about my hypocrisy each time I ordered a hamburger.”
A year later, however, Haidt described a very different experience. As part of a study exploring the psychology of disgust, Haidt watched a video of cows going through a slaughterhouse. “I watched in horror as cows, moving down a dripping disassembly line, were bludgeoned, hooked, and sliced up,” Haidt wrote.
“For days afterward, the sight of red meat made me queasy. My visceral feelings now matched the beliefs Singer had given me,” Haidt went on. “I became a vegetarian. For about three weeks.”
Vegetarian advocates seem to have had better success at convincing people that it’s a good thing to eat less meat—it really is much better for the environment, better for our health, and better for animals—but a comparably much poorer job of helping people follow through. Of those who were once vegetarians, a sizeable portion, 40 percent, admit that they’re interested in returning to a plant-based diet. This would effectively double the number of existing vegetarians in the United States, but require a more sophisticated appreciation of the difference between moral opposition and behavioral opposition.
“If I was running some advocacy groups, I’d try to promote vegetarian clubs or groups or eating organizations that would encourage some sort of way of putting vegetarians in greater contact with one another,” Rothgerber told me. “Host dinner parties, have eating clubs, basically I would be trying to link as many vegetarians with each other as possible. The more vegetarians are isolated and by themselves in this behavior, then the worse things will be.”",8871

The bombing killed 54 people in Gaziantep near the Syrian border and it stunned Turks -- not just for the high death toll but also because President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the bomber was between 12 and 14 years old.
ISIS, which has used children in combat or to act as human bombs in attacks across the Middle East, is suspected in the attack, Erdogan said. No group has claimed responsibility for the blast.
On Monday, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking to reporters in the capital of Ankara, said Turkey does not know who was behind the attack. He said it's unclear at the present time whether the attacker was ""a child or an adult.""
It is rumored that the attacker was a child, Yildirim said.
""The security forces are focusing on it and trying to find clues related to it,"" the prime minister said.
Many of those killed were young teens
Twenty-two of the 54 killed in a devastating bomb attack that struck the wedding were under 14, a Turkish official said Monday.
The revelation added a fresh layer of horror to the bombing, which also wounded dozens of others. It was the deadliest in a string of blasts across Turkey this year.
The bomb struck in crowded streets of the Beybahce neighborhood of Gaziantep's Sahinbey district during celebrations for the wedding of a Kurdish couple.
The blast disproportionately killed women and children, as it had been timed to detonate during a part of the festivities when those groups painted themselves with henna, authorities said.
As the dead were swiftly laid to rest, in accordance with Islamic tradition, their loved ones spoke of their anguish.
Emine Ayhan, who lost four of her five children and whose husband was seriously injured, told Turkish television: ""If my remaining child was not alive, I would commit suicide.""
Hakki Okur, 14, was among the young victims. His cousin, Mesut Bozkurt, recounted searching for the teen throughout the night following the blast before his family was summoned to the hospital to identify his body.
""No injuries on his head, but burns on his chest,"" Bozkurt said.
""We think he may have been trapped in the panic since he was a skinny boy.""

Authorities found remnants of an explosive vest at the scene, and officials said they are not clear whether it was detonated remotely or by the bomber.
ISIS, which has struck before in Gaziantep and reportedly has a strong presence in the city, traditionally hasn't claimed responsibility for attacks on Turkish soil.
Gaziantep is about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo.

Child bomber thwarted in Iraq
On Sunday, a would-be child bomber was captured by security guards in Kirkuk -- a city in northern Iraq with a large Kurdish population. Broadcaster Kurdistan 24 aired footage of guards apprehending the teen and stripping him of his suicide vest before he could strike.
Najmaldin Karim, the governor of Kirkuk province, told CNN that the thwarted bomber was a 15-year-old who arrived from Mosul -- the largest city under ISIS control -- a week earlier. Following an earlier suicide attack in the city Sunday, the guards noticed something odd about the teen and stopped him before he struck his target, a Shia mosque.
""He is trained and brainwashed,"" Karim told CNN.
""They tell them if they do this, they will go to heaven and have a good time and get everything that they ever wanted.""
Mia Bloom, a Georgia State University professor who is an expert on child soldiers and terrorism, said ISIS made wide use of children in conflict, typically employing them as bombers or snipers, either attached to adult fighting units or operating on their own.
The organization has eulogized more than 250 child attackers on its channels on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app the terror group widely uses.
ISIS has lured children ""through a variety of tricks and treats, the way pedophiles lure in young kids,"" she said.
But often -- if child soldiers are internally displaced persons, as the thwarted Kirkuk bomber was reported to be, or otherwise vulnerable -- they may feel ""that they had no choice but to join ... perhaps in exchange for food or protection or not upsetting the authorities in Raqqa or in Mosul.""
Child bombers who are coerced often deliberately fail to launch their attacks, as the teen in Kirkuk may have done, she said.
People wait Sunday near freshly dug graves for the victims of the Gaziantep blast.
Pro-Kurdish party struck
Turkish news agency DHA broadcast footage showing the bride and groom overcome by emotion as they returned to the blast site at an apartment building that was home to the groom's parents and where the newlyweds were to live after their wedding.
Distraught to revisit the scene of so much bloodshed, the couple were rushed back to the hospital for treatment, with the overwhelmed bride carried into the ward by her husband and a relative.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party said in a statement condemning the blast that the wedding was for one of its members.

The latter attack, targeting a peace rally near the capital's central railway station, claimed more than 100 lives, making it the deadliest terror attack in modern Turkish history.

The statement criticized Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party for failing to prevent such attacks and said its ""hate speech, discriminating and dividing attitude in democratic political arenas furnishes the conditions"" for such acts.
Relations between the government and Turkey's Kurdish minority have been strained as a result of a decades-long Kurdish insurgency.

Kurds targeted by ISIS
The Kurds have become key American allies in the battle against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, placing Kurdish targets squarely in the Sunni terror group's cross hairs.
Kurdish militia played a central role in driving the group from the Syrian city of Manbij this month , cutting a main supply route from the Turkish border to its heartland in Raqqa.
ISIS operatives have struck before in the bustling southern Turkish city of about 1.5 million people, with the group claiming responsibility for the shootings of anti-ISIS activists there in December and April
The terror group has been blamed for a series of bomb attacks throughout Turkey, which allows planes from the US-led anti-ISIS coalition to operate from its air base at Incirlik.
ISIS is believed to have extensive cells throughout Turkey. Citing Turkish security sources, Anadolu reported last month that 5,300 suspected ISIS members had been detained in Turkey.

Ongoing turmoil
Even before the attempted July 15 coup, Turkey had experienced a year of bloodshed and political turmoil, weathering a string of deadly bomb blasts, blamed variously on ISIS and the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the PKK.
In attacks last week, 11 people were killed and hundreds injured in three bombings targeting security forces in eastern Turkey
The Turkish government blamed the PKK, which has typically targeted police and the military, whereas ISIS tends to launch mass casualty attacks on soft, civilian targets.

544367462012432384,true,"MORE: Police confirm 3 hostages escape Sydney cafe, unknown number remain inside http://t.co/pcAt91LIdS #Sydneysiege",http://fxn.ws/1GFRtou,True,"Police say 3 dead, including gunman, after raid ends Sydney hostage situation","Police say three people are dead -- including the gunman -- after authorities stormed a Sydney cafe early Tuesday, bringing to a dramatic end a 16-hour standoff in which a jihadist and murder suspect had held 17 hostages in a scene much of the world watched on television.
A series of explosions, believed to be gunshots and flash grenades, came just before 2:30 a.m. local time as several more hostages fled Lindt Chocolat Cafe, where a man identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian also known for sending hate mail to the families of fallen soldiers, was holed up with the captives. Authorities say Monis was shot and killed during the confrontation with police.
A 34-year-old man and 38-year-old woman also were among the dead, police said. Four people were injured in the raid, including a female hostage who was shot in the leg, an official told The Associated Press. One policeman, who suffered a gunshot wound in the face, is in good condition and is grateful to be alive, Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters at a press conference.
Several people were taken from the building on stretchers as an alarm rang and police in riot gear moved in and out of the shop, in the heart of Australia's largest city's business district. A bomb disposal robot was seen being deployed in the shop, though police said the standoff was over. Authorities later said no explosive devices were found.
The handful of hostages seen fleeing as the explosions echoed through the predawn air followed escapes hours earlier by five captives.
More On This... Police: Sydney gunman Iranian refugee with criminal past
""Sydney siege is over. More details to follow"" New South Wales police posted on Twitter.
Scipione called the ordeal a ""distressing time"" for the families of those involved.
“We are strong together. We will get through this,"" added New South Wales Premier Mike Baird.
For hours, television news crews had broadcast footage of frightened hostages looking out through the front window. Initially, police did not identify Monis, though they knew he was the suspect inside. His identity was known early on to police and media alike, but was only released for the record by police sources as night fell on Sydney with the nation transfixed on the televised scene.
During the evening hours on Monday, several people were seen with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass, and two people were seen holding up a black flag associated with Islamic fanaticism. Australian broadcaster Network Ten reported that Monis, seen wielding a shotgun and a machete, has forced hostages to call him ""The Brother"" and demanded to speak directly with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
""The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,"" Seven Network television news reporter Chris Reason said, according to The Associated Press. ""One woman we've counted was there for at least two hours -- an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.""
[image]
The drama began during the Monday morning rush hour and carried into night time in Australia's largest city. Five hostages escaped some six hours into the ordeal, running out a side door and into the arms of police, who have the shop surrounded. The shop is in Sydney's central business district in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city's financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Shops in the area were closed and people were ordered to stay out.
A journalist on the scene tweeted that the terror suspect appeared to fly into a rage after the hostages escaped.
[pullquote]
""The gunman could be seen from here getting extremely agitated, shouting at remaining hostages,"" tweeted journalist Chris Reason.
Reason described Monis as unshaven, wearing a white shirt and a black cap, and holding what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun. He could be seen pacing back and forth past the cafe's four windows. Sky News described Monis as bearded, middle-aged and wearing a black and white headband. Sky cited reports that he is known to police and media outlets.
""Just two hours ago when we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,"" Reason reported.
[image]
Monis, who reportedly emigrated to Australia in 1996, is known in Australia for his public campaign of writing letters to the families of fallen soldiers calling them “murderers” and urging the recipients to lobby the government to withdraw from Afghanistan. Haron was charged in 2009 with using the postal service to harass in a case he fought all the way to Australia’s highest court, which dismissed his appeal.
Last year, he was charged in connection with the murder of his ex-wife in a case that is pending as Monis is free on bail. He was charged earlier this year with sexual assault of a woman who went to his office in New South Wales for ""spiritual healing.""
""This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act. It's a damaged goods individual who's done something outrageous,"" his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness.""
Monis ran a website which was taken down shortly after he was named as the gunman in the hostage situation, Sky News reports. In a letter posted to the website, which he signed Sheikh Haron, he accused Australia, Britain and the U.S. of ""oppression and terrorism"" and posted images of dead children.
Monis also reportedly called for non-violent activism, writing that ""Islam is the religion of peace and a Muslim should be a peace activist.""
As night descended on Sydney, the lights inside the shop went off, but it was unclear if that was by the suspected jihadist's choice or if the police made the cafe go dark as a negotiating tactic. Earlier, the gunman appeared to be rotating frightened hostages in front of the window, holding up the black Islamist flag ""Shahada"" flag, an emblem of Jabhat al-Nusra, the Al Qaeda-linked terror group fighting - sometimes with, sometimes against - Islamic State in Syria.
The gunman was reportedly relaying threats and demands through two hostages, and claimed to have planted two bombs inside the cafe and two others elsewhere in Sydney's central business district.
Late Monday, Abbott released a pre-recorded statement calling the attack ""very disturbing"" and ""profoundly shocking."" His office didn't respond to the gunman's demands.
Three men were seen running from a fire exit of the cafe approximately six hours after the hostage situation began at 9:45 a.m. local time. Moments later, two women believed to be employees, followed suit. It was not immediately clear how the hostages escaped.
The U.S. Consulate, located just south of the cafe, was also evacuated and a warning issued urging Americans in Sydney to ""maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security."" A White House official told Fox News that President Obama had been briefed on the situation.
Lindt Australia posted a message on its Facebook page thanking the public for its support.
""We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,"" the company wrote.
The government raised Australia's terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia's three largest cities -- Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.
The Islamic State group, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, Islamic State group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani issued an audio message urging so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all ""disbelievers,"" whether they be civilians or soldiers.

Clementa Pinckney, 41, was the beloved pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the country's oldest black churches, and had been a state legislator for 19 years.
He has been remembered as a 'giant' and a 'legend' by his peers.
Just one year after graduating from Allen University in 1995, Pinckney became, at 23, the youngest African-American elected to the South Carolina Legislature. In 2000, he was elected to the state Senate.
He earned a master's degree in public administration from the University of South Carolina in 1999 and studied at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary.
A native of Beaufort, Pinckney began preaching at age 13 and was first appointed pastor at 18. He was named pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2010, according to the state Democratic Party.
'He had a core not many of us have,' said Sen. Vincent Sheheen, who sat beside him in Senate chambers. 'I think of the irony that the most gentle of the 46 of us — the best of the 46 of us in this chamber — is the one who lost his life.'

'She was a God-fearing woman,' said granddaughter Najee Washington, 23, who lived with Lance.
'She was the heart of the family, and she still is. She is a very caring, giving and loving woman. She was beautiful inside and out.'
'Granny was the heart of the family,' her grandson Jon Quil Lance told The Post and Courier.
'She's a Christian, hardworking; I could call my granny for anything. I don't have anyone else like that'.
Susie Jackson, 87
Lance had five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
SUSIE JACKSON
Susie Jackson, 87, was a longtime church member and sang in the choir.
She and Ethel Lance were cousins.
Jackson had recently visited her son and grandchildren in Cleveland, Ohio.
Tim Jackson told Cleveland television station WEWS that his grandmother was a loving, giving woman with a great smile.
'It's just hard to process that my grandmother had to leave Earth this way,' he said.
'It's real, real hard. It's challenging because I don't believe she deserved to go this way.'
Susie Jackson, who was fond of playing slot machines, was scheduled to go on a church-sponsored bus trip to Chicago on Sunday and was looking forward to going to the top of the Willis Tower, said Jean Jackson, an associate member of the church.
Tywanza Sanders, 26
TYWANZA SANDERS
The youngest person killed in the attack was Tywanza Sanders, who graduated from Allen University's division of business administration in Columbia last year.
'He was a quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education,' according to a statement from Allen University.
'He presented a warm and helpful spirit as he interacted with his colleagues.
'Mr. Sanders was participating in the Bible Study session at Mother Emanuel church at the time of the shooting.'
His social media pages also indicate he worked at a barber shop.
Sanders posted his last Instagram picture before the meeting last night.
'A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives,' it read, quoting Jackie Robinson.
DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49
DEPAYNE MIDDLETON-DOCTOR
Whether she was working with college students or Charleston's poorest residents, DePayne Middleton-Doctor wanted to be in a position to help people.
So co-workers weren't surprised when she decided to become a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
'She was a woman of God,' said Joel Crawford, who worked with Middleton-Doctor at Southern Wesleyan University's campus in Charleston. 'She was strong in her faith.'
Middleton-Doctor, a 49-year-old mother of four daughters, just started her job as an enrollment counselor at the university in December, said Crawford, who worked with her as a student services coordinator.
Before that, Middleton-Doctor had been employed for several years by Charleston County, where she helped administer grants aimed at helping the county's poorest residents with problems they couldn't otherwise afford to fix such as repairing roofs or septic tanks, said J. Elliott Summey, chairman of the Charleston County Council. He said she left her county job in 2005.
Crawford said Middleton-Doctor often went to midweek prayer meetings at Emanuel AME Church as she worked toward becoming a minister.
Cynthia Hurd, 54
On Facebook, her sister paid tribute to her 'beautiful Songbird'.
'I will truly miss you my love,' she wrote. 'Your beautiful personality, your laughter, your smile, and your love for everyone.'
CYNTHIA HURD
Cynthia Hurd's brother took some comfort in knowing that his sister died in the church she grew up in and loved.
Hurd, 54, was the manager of one of the busiest branches of the Charleston County library system. In her honor, the system closed all 16 of its branches Thursday, the day after her death.
She grew up in Charleston, and her mother made sure they went Emanuel AME Church on Sundays, Wednesdays and any other time it was open, said her brother Malcom Graham, a former state senator from North Carolina.
'I wasn't surprised on a Wednesday night she was there,' Graham said Thursday.
Myra Thompson, 59
Hurd's husband is a merchant sailor currently at sea near Saudi Arabia. Graham was trying to help him get home.
When Graham spoke to his sister last weekend, she said she couldn't wait for her 55th birthday on Sunday, he said.
She was also looking toward retirement after 31 years of library work.
'Cynthia was a tireless servant of the community who spent her life helping residents, making sure they had every opportunity for an education and personal growth,' the library said in a statement.
'Her loss is incomprehensible, and we ask for prayers for her family, her co-workers, her church and this entire community as we come together to face this tragic loss.'
MYRA THOMPSON
Myra Thompson, 59, was also killed at the church, her daughter confirmed but would not comment further.
Daniel Simmons, 45
Thompson was the wife of Rev Anthony Thompson, Vicar of Holy Trinity REC (ACNA) Church in Charleston.
Archbishop Foley Beach wrote on Facebook: 'Please join me in praying for the Rev. Anthony Thompson, Vicar of Holy Trinity REC (ACNA Church in Charleston, his family, and their congregation, with the killing of his wife, Myra, in the Charleston shootings last night.'
Thompson's daughter is reportedly a prominent figure in Atlanta's Big Bethel AME Church.
DANIEL L SIMMONS
Daniel L Simmons, 45, a retired pastor from another church in Charleston, also died.
He attended the church every Sunday for services and Wednesdays for bible study, his daughter-in-law said.",8598

Less well known is the fact that while Steve Jobs was born in California he was actually adopted, and his biological father was a political migrant from the Syrian city of Homs, now devastated by the civil war in Syria.
On Twitter this fact has now gone viral, starting via a tweet by David Galbraith, and further exposed by the BBC World Service's Outside Source programme. It remains a powerful statement, especially following the ISIS atrocities in Syria, Iraq, Egypt and now with Donald Trump's indefinite ban of Syrian refugees.
While some people are horrified at the numbers fleeing Syria, and worry about the consequences of other countries taking on millions of refugees, many have pointed out that previous Syrian migrants have boosted the West’s culture, business and technology – most notably the biological father of Steve Jobs – Abdul Fattah Jandali, who is still alive (aged 85) and living in Nevada.
Jandali fled the Middle East because of protests and demonstrations that eventually toppled the president of Lebanon.
He is a non-practicing Muslim and hasn’t been on the Haj (the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca), but he has stated that he believes in Islam in doctrine and culture.
“I have never experienced any problem or discrimination in the United States because of my religion or race. Other than my accent, which might sometimes suggest that I’m from another country, I have completely integrated in society here,"" he is quoted as saying in a Lebanese news website.
Jandali was born in 1931 in Homs, Syria to a wealthy landowner. His father was a self-made millionaire who owned “several entire villages”, according to his son. He father held complete authority over his children.
His mother was a traditional Muslim woman who “took care of the house and me and my four sisters, but she was conservative, obedient, and a housewife”.
He had wanted to study law at Damascus University to become a lawyer, but his authoritarian father disagreed, saying that there were “too many lawyers in Syria”.
At 18 Jandali left Syria for Lebanon to continue his studies at the American University of Beirut. He described Beirut as the city “where I spent the best days of my life”.
At the university he was an activist for Arab nationalism, and demonstrated for the independence of Algeria and even spent three days in prison.
Protests from 1952-54 forced him to flee Beirut. The protests demanded the resignation of then Lebanese president, Bechara El Khoury, who later became the first Arab president to step down under the pressure of popular demonstrations in the streets.
Unlike many of the Syrian migrants now fleeing to Europe Jandali moved to New York, where he lived with a relative, Najm Eddin al-Rifai, who was the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations.
Jandali studied at Colombia University and Wisconsin University where he received a scholarship that enabled him to obtain a Ph.D. in Economics and Political Sciences.
While studying in Wisconsin Jandali met and dated a German-Swiss Catholic called Joanne Carol Schieble, who was soon pregnant with his child.
Her conservative Catholic father refused to allow her to marry Jandali because he was a Muslim.
Jandali then left Schieble not long before the baby’s birth on 24 February 1955.
Steve Jobs' adoptive parents
The newborn boy was put up for adoption in San Francisco, with the stipulation that the adoptive parents be Catholic and college educated.
The first-choice parents (Catholic, educated and wealthy) suddenly decided they wanted a girl.
So it was that another couple, Paul and Clara Jobs, adopted the boy.
Schieble nearly refused this later adoption because the Jobs weren’t college educated.
Luckily for us Paul Jobs passed on to Steve his love of mechanics, which led to Steve’s friendship with Steve Wozniak and the eventual founding of Apple Computer.
There is another refugee link in that Clara's parents had landed in New Jersey after fleeing the Turks in Armenia.
“Knowing I was adopted may have made me feel more independent, but I have never felt abandoned,"" said Steve Jobs.
""I’ve always felt special. My parents made me feel special.”
He hated it when anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his “adoptive” parents or implied that they were not his “real” parents: “They were my parents 1,000%,” he said.
Of his biological parents, Jandali and Schieble, he was dismissive: “They were my sperm and egg bank. That’s not harsh, it’s just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.”
Not long after the adoption Jandali reunited with Schieble, and the couple were married. A year later they had a daughter, Mona – who went on to become a successful American novelist. Jobs didn’t meet the then Mona Simpson until he was 27 years old.
But Jandali was soon again on the move. Following financial problems he returned to Syria, hoping to land a job in the diplomatic corps.
But a life as a diplomat was not to be, and he instead worked for a year as a director in an oil refinery back in Homs. While in Syria he divorced Schieble.
In 1962, Jandali returned to the US, but did not contact Joanne, who had remarried an American.
Jandali worked as an assistant professor at Michigan University and later Nevada University. Later he bought a restaurant and then worked in Las Vegas. At age 84 he remains the Vice Chairman of the Boomtown Casino and Hotel in Reno, Nevada.
Did Steve Jobs ever meet his biological father?
Steve Jobs believed that he unknowingly met his biological father when Jandali was manager of a restaurant in Sacramento.
“I was in the restaurant once or twice, and I remember meeting the owner who was from Syria. And it was most certainly [my father]. I shook his hand and he shook my hand. And that’s all,” Jobs told his official biographer Walter Isaacson.
Later his sister Mona revealed that Jandali was the owner of that restaurant.
Jobs also told Isaacson that he decided not to pursue a relationship with Jandali: “I learned a little bit about him and I didn’t like what I learned”.
Before Steve’s death Jandali explained that he had no contact with his son, but believed him to be a genius.
""I don’t have a close relationship with him. I send him a message on his birthday, but neither of us has made overtures to come closer to the other. I tend to think that if he wants to spend time with me he knows where I am and how to get hold of me.”
Jandali rejects the term “Father of Invention,” which some have tried to foster on him.
“My daughter Mona is a famous writer, and my biological son is Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple. The reason he was put up for adoption was because my girlfriend’s father was extremely conservative and wouldn’t let her marry me, and she decided to give him up for adoption.
“Steve is my biological son, but I didn’t bring him up, and he has a family that adopted him. So if it’s said that I’m the ‘father of invention’, then that’s because my biological son is a genius and my daughter a brilliant writer. I thank God for my success in life, but I’m no inventor.
“I think that if my son Steve had been brought up with a Syrian name he would have achieved the same success. He has a brilliant mind. And he didn’t finish his university studies. That’s why I think he would have succeeded whatever his background.""
Banksy artwork in Calais depicts Steve Jobs as a migrant
Well known Grafitti artist Banksy created artwork in the 'Jungle' refugee camp in Calais depicting the late Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, as a migrant. Jobs, the son of a Syrian migrant, can be seen carrying an old Apple Mac computer, along with a black bag of possessions thrown over his shoulder, much like the occupants of the camp would have.
The art draws direct comparisons between Steve Jobs father, who was a migrant from Syria, and the current situation in Europe (and the US). The artwork is supposed to draw attention to the benefits of migration, Banksy has since said. Considering Jobs' helped to shape the world as we know it today with the introduction of the iPhone, we can't help but wonder how different things would've been without him...",8387

(Photo: Thibault Camus, AP)
PARIS — Authorities identified three suspects in a deadly shooting attack on a satirical newspaper that killed 12 people Wednesday as thousands jammed a public square for an evening vigil honoring victims of France's deadliest terror attack in a half century.
Two of those killed were police officers, one of them shot dead on a sidewalk outside the newspaper. Eight journalists were among the victims.
The suspects are two brothers — Said, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, both French nationals — and Hamyd Mourad, 18, whose nationality wasn't known, a Paris police official told the Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
The youngest suspect surrendered at a police station in Charleville-Mezieres, a small town in France's eastern Champagne region, Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said. French police early Thursday released photos of the brothers they were seeking, saying they should be considered armed and dangerous.
French news media reported late Wednesday that a major police operation was taking place around an apartment building in Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris.
The brothers were born in Paris of Algerian descent. Cherif was sentenced to three years in prison on terrorism charges in May 2008. Both brothers returned from Syria this summer.

At least 15,000 gathered at the Place de la République for a vigil after the three gunmen, wearing hoods and armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles, stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo, shouting Islamic phrases and killing 12 people. The publication is a satirical newspaper that has caricatured the prophet Mohammed.
""They wanted to put France down on its knees, but we will show them solidarity and unity,"" Ilan Scialom, 30, vice president of COEXISTER, an interfaith group in Paris that promotes tolerance, said at the Paris rally. Thousands turned out for similar vigils in Lyon and elsewhere across Europe. Some held signs saying, ""Not afraid.""

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the midday attack.
Eight journalists, a guest and two police officers were killed, said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, giving a partial breakdown of the dead. Among those killed were Bernard Maris, an economist who contributed to the newspaper and was heard regularly on French radio, and cartoonists Georges Wolinski and Berbard Verlhac, better known as Tignous.
President Francois Hollande called the attack a terrorist act ""of exceptional barbarism,"" and said other attacks have been thwarted in France in recent weeks. Fears have been running high in France and elsewhere in Europe that jihadis returning from conflicts in Syria and Iraq will stage attacks at home.
Cherif Kouachi was well known to French law enforcement. At 26, he was sentenced to three years in prison with 18 months suspended for criminal association with a terrorist enterprise for his conviction in 2008 as part of a group of seven men.
Prosecutors said the group recruited French Muslims to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group, known as the 19th Arrondissement Network for the working class Paris district where it was based, allegedly recruited young men, arranged for weapons training and helped them travel though Syria to Iraq. Police arrested Kouachi in January 2005, days before he allegedly planned to travel to Syria.
The rampage began around noon when the suspects killed a receptionist to gain entrance to the offices in central Paris, then opened fire on a second-floor editorial meeting, killing 10 people, Molins said. The officers were killed during the suspects' getaway, he said.
Eleven others were injured, including four who were listed in serious condition.
Molins said the attackers shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"") and the ""prophet is avenged"" before fleeing in a stolen black Citroen, exchanging gunfire at least twice with police outside.
Cartoonist Corine Rey, also known as ""Coco,"" told the weekly Humanité that she was forced at gunpoint to allow the men inside the building.
""They shot (cartoonists) Wolinski, Cabu … it lasted about five minutes,"" she told the newspaper, according to France24. ""I took cover under a desk. … They spoke perfect French. … They said they were al-Qaeda.""

The dead included Stephane Charbonnier, the weekly newspaper's editorial director known as Charb, spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre of the Paris prosecutor's office confirmed. Charb's bodyguard — assigned to him after death threats — was among those killed, said Christophe Crepin, a police union spokesman. Four cartoonists whose work included controversial drawings of the prophet Mohammed were killed.
In response to the death threats, Charb, according to France24, told colleagues at one point, ""I am not afraid of retaliation. I have no kids, no wife, no car, no credit. It perhaps sounds a bit pompous, but I prefer to die standing than living on my knees.""
One police officer was shot execution-style on a sidewalk. The gunman, in a chilling video taken from a second-floor balcony, opened fire on a police officer, who collapsed. One of the gunmen then calmly walked up to the officer and killed him, before returning to the getaway car with his fellow assailant.

The newspaper's editor, Gerard Biard, escaped the attack because he was in London.
The publication, whose barbs are aimed at a wide range of religious and political institutions, has been heavily criticized by Muslims for years. In 2011, its offices were firebombed after a spoof issue featured a caricature of Mohammed on its cover.
In Paris, as word of the killings spread, crowds gathered for an impromptu show of support at the Place de la République.
By evening, Parisians huddled under the arm of the statue of the Glory of the Republic of France, clapped and chanted ""Charlie"" and ""Liberté."" Many held signs that read, ""Je suis Charlie"" (""I am Charlie""), while others held up pens to symbolize the freedom of the press.
""I'm under shock, I think like all French journalists. I came here because I wanted to express my solidarity with Charlie and show my support for freedom of expression,"" said Sarah Halifa-Legrand, a reporter attending the vigil. ""There are so many people, everywhere in the square. Some have climbed up on the statue; people have lit up little candles. It's very touching. There's not so much noise, it's quiet. People are mourning. It's very moving.""
CLOSE Just hours after the attack there are already over 750,000 Tweets under the hastag #JeSuisCharlie. (News, USA TODAY)
In Washington, President Obama condemned the ""horrific shooting"" and said the United States was in touch with French officials ""to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.""
Secretary of State John Kerry called the incident a ""murderous attack"" and said ""each and every American"" stood beside France.
The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers and the World Editors Forum condemned the assault.
""An attack of this nature strikes at the heart of the very freedoms that the press in France so passionately defends,"" WAN-IFRA CEO Vincent Peyrègne said in a statement. ""It is not just an attack against the press, but also an attack on the fabric of our society and the values for which we all stand.""

757748522481491968,unverified,Tim Kaine &amp; His Besties The Muslim Brotherhood  https://t.co/fGdWekzDDr #DemsInPhilly #DNCConvention https://t.co/wyIJpKplqK,http://www.wnd.com/2016/07/hillary-vp-picks-dark-ties-to-islamists/,True,Hillary VP pick's dark ties to Islamists,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s newly-announced running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, has been portrayed as a safe pick, a “pristine” candidate with a history of missionary work in Central America, a fluent Spanish-speaker and a moderate by Democrat standards.
But a new report out by a national-security expert suggests maybe Kaine’s record isn’t so clean after all.
He has a history of embracing Islamists, writes Ryan Mauro in an article for the Clarion Project.
“He appointed a Hamas supporter to a state immigration commission; spoke at a dinner honoring a Muslim Brotherhood terror suspect and received donations from well-known Islamist groups,” says Mauro, a fellow with the Clarion Project and an adjunct professor of homeland security at Liberty University in Virginia.
Appointing Muslim leader who supports Hamas
In 2007, when Kaine was governor of Virginia, he appointed Muslim American Society President Esam Omeish to the state’s Immigration Commission. The MAS is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, as documented in a 2008 court filing in Dallas, Texas, during the Holy Land Foundation trial. The foundation was a conduit for sending money to Hamas, a Palestinian terror group dedicated to the destruction of the state of Israel.
In contrast to Mauro’s hard-hitting exposé, Clinton’s pick for vice president is getting the “kid-glove treatment” by the mainstream media, according to a Fox News report.
“The media are giving their official blessing to Hillary Clinton’s choice of Tim Kaine, praising him as a calm, experienced and slightly dull guy who can help her govern,” writes Howard Kurz for Fox.
“What they are not doing is picking the Virginia senator apart, and highlighting his disagreements with the nominee, which marked the coverage of Donald Trump’s selection of Mike Pence.”
Another, more moderate Muslim organization that opposes the extremist Brotherhood’s hardline Islamist agenda came out against the appointment saying it showed a reckless lack of vetting.
A Chicago Tribune investigation in 2004 also exposed the MAS as a Brotherhood front, as well as MAS’ crafty use of deceptive semantics to appear moderate, Mauro reported.
Convicted terrorist and admitted U.S. Muslim Brotherhood member Abdurrahman Alamoudi testified in 2012, “Everyone knows that MAS is the Muslim Brotherhood.”
Read Clarion’s fully-documented profile of MAS here.
According to Omeish’s website, he was also president of the National Muslim Students Association, another Brotherhood offshoot, and served for two years on the national board of yet another Brotherhood organization, the Islamic Society of North America or ISNA.
“His website says he was the vice president of Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center, a radical mosque known for its history of terror ties, including having future Al-Qaeda operative Anwar Al-Awlaki as its imam and being frequented by two of the 9/11 hijackers and Nidal Hasan, the perpetrator of the Fort Hood shooting. Omeish’s website says he remains a board member,” Mauro writes.
Omeish’s website also says he was chairman of the board of Islamic American University, which had Hamas financier and Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef Al-Qaradawi chairman of its board until at least 2006, Mauro reports.
Omeish was also chairman of the board for the Islamic Center of Passaic County, a New Jersey mosque with heavy terrorist ties and an imam that the Department of Homeland Security wants to deport for having links to Hamas.
Omeish directly expressed extremism before Kaine appointed him. He claimed the Brotherhood is “moderate” and admitted he and MAS are influenced by the Islamist movement. Islamism is the philosophy of political Islam, teaching the Shariah concept that Islam is to rule over all areas of society and is not separated from the reins of government power.
In 2004, Omeish praised the Hamas spiritual leader as “our beloved Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.”
Videotape from 2000 also surfaced where Omeish pledged to help Palestinians who understand “the jihad way is the way to liberate your land,” later denying this was an endorsement of violence.
When a state delegate wrote a letter to then-Governor Kaine warning him that the MAS has “questionable origins,” a Kaine spokesperson said the charge was bigotry.
“Kaine obviously failed to do any kind of basic background checking in Omeish,” Mauro writes.
Omeish resigned under heavy pressure, and Kaine acknowledged that his statements “concerned” him.
“But, apparently, they didn’t concern him enough to actually learn about the Muslim Brotherhood network in his state and to take greater precautions in the future,” concludes Mauro.
And the Islamist ties don’t stop there.
Kaine speaks at Islamist event
In September 2011, Kaine spoke at a “Candidates Night” dinner organized by the New Dominion PAC that presented a Lifetime Achievement Award for Jamal Barzinji, who the Global Muslim Brotherhood Watch describes as a “founding father of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood.”
He first came on to the FBI’s radar in 1987-1988 when an informant inside the Brotherhood identified Barzinji and his associated groups as being part of a network of Brotherhood fronts to “institute the Islamic Revolution in the United States.” The source said Barzinji and his colleagues were “organizing political support which involves influencing both public opinion in the United States as well as the United States Government” using “political action front groups with no traceable ties.”
Barzinji had his home searched as part of a terrorism investigation in 2003. U.S. Customs Service Senior Special Agent David Kane said in a sworn affidavit that Barzinji and the network of entities he led were investigated because he “is not only closely associated with PIJ [Palestinian Islamic Jihad]…but also with Hamas.” Counter-terrorism reporter Patrick Poole broke the story that Barzinji was nearly prosecuted but the Obama Justice Department dropped plans for indictment.
Barzinji played a major role in nearly every Brotherhood front in the U.S. and was vice president of the International Institute of Islamic Thought or IIIT, which also came under terrorism investigation, according to Mauro’s documented research.
The indictment of Al-Arian and his colleagues says they “would and did seek to obtain support from influential individuals in the United States under the guise of promoting and protecting Arab rights.”
Islamist financial support
Barzinji’s organization, IIIT, donated $10,000 in 2011 to the New Dominion PAC, the organization that held the event honoring Barzinji that Kaine spoke at. The Barzinji-tied New Dominion PAC donated $43,050 to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign between 2003 and 2005.
That figure doesn’t even include other political recipients that assisted Kaine’s campaign.
The PAC has very strong ties to the Democratic Party in Virginia, according to Mauro, with the Virginia Public Access Project tallying almost $257,000 in donations. This may explain why Barzinji’s grandson served in Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s administration and then became the Obama Administration’s liaison to the Muslim-American community.
The Middle East Forum’s Islamist Money in Politics database shows another $4,300 donated to Kaine’s Senate campaign in 2011-2012 by officials from U.S. Muslim Brotherhood entities ISNA and the Council on American-Islamic Relations or CAIR, Mauro reports. Another $3,500 came from Hisham Al-Talib, a leader from Barzinji’s IIIT.
Barzinji’s IIIT donated $3,500 to Esam Omeish’s 2009 campaign delegate campaign, tying together the cadre of Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders who got into Kaine’s orbit.
Conclusion
“Kaine has no excuse,” Mauro concluded. “If he has an Internet connection, then he and his staff should have known about their backgrounds. They were either extremely careless (something Kaine would have in common with the top of the ticket) or knew and looked the other way in the hopes of earning donations and votes.
“Clinton’s choice of Kaine is widely seen as a way of strengthening her campaign’s national security credentials. Yet, Clinton is asking us to trust a candidate on national security who appoints a Hamas supporter to an immigration commission and speaks at a dinner honoring a Muslim Brotherhood terror suspect.”",8330

The murder of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 in the UK was ""probably"" approved by President Vladimir Putin, an inquiry has found.
Mr Putin is likely to have signed off the poisoning of Mr Litvinenko with polonium-210 in part due to personal ""antagonism"" between the pair, it said.
Home Secretary Theresa May said the murder was a ""blatant and unacceptable"" breach of international law.
But the Russian Foreign Ministry said the public inquiry was ""politicised"".
It said: ""We regret that the purely criminal case was politicised and overshadowed the general atmosphere of bilateral relations.""
What Litvinenko report means for UK
Key findings of the public inquiry
Who was Alexander Litvinenko?
Who are the Litvinenko murder suspects?
Story of a perplexing murder
Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin's spokesman, said Moscow's official response to the report will happen through ""diplomatic channels"", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying.
Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would have to go on having ""some sort of relationship with them [Russia]"" because of the Syria crisis, but it would be done with ""clear eyes and a very cold heart"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron said the murder of Alexander Litvinenko had been shown to be ""state-sponsored""
The long-awaited report into Mr Litvinenko's death found that two Russian men - Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - deliberately poisoned the 43-year-old in London in 2006 by putting the radioactive substance polonium-210 into his drink at a hotel.
Sir Robert Owen, the public inquiry chairman, said he was ""sure"" Mr Litvinenko's murder had been carried out by the two men and that they were probably acting under the direction of Moscow's FSB intelligence service, and approved by the organisation's chief, Nikolai Patrushev, as well as the Russian president.
He said Mr Litvinenko's work for British intelligence agencies, his criticism of the FSB and Mr Putin, and his association with other Russian dissidents were possible motives for his killing.
'Send a message'
There was also ""undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism"" between Mr Putin and Mr Litvinenko, he said.
The use of polonium-210 was ""at the very least a strong indicator of state involvement"" as it had to be made in a nuclear reactor, the report said.
The inquiry heard evidence that Mr Litvinenko may have been consigned to a slow death from radiation to ""send a message"".
What is polonium-210?
Image caption The teapot where traces of polonium-210 were discovered
Giving a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said Mr Cameron would raise the findings with President Putin at ""the next available opportunity"".
She said the UK would impose asset freezes on Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun and that international arrest warrants for the pair remained in place. They both deny killing Mr Litvinenko.

Speaking earlier outside the High Court, Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said she was ""very happy"" that ""the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr Putin have been proved by an English court"".
She urged the UK government to expel all Russian intelligence operatives, impose economic sanctions on Moscow and impose a travel ban on Mr Putin.
The view from Moscow

By the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev
For years Moscow rejected allegations of high-level involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko.
The fact President Putin himself is now associated with this assassination has not changed anything.
Taking their lead from Robert Owen's use of the words ""high probability"", the second tier of the Russian establishment, mainly Kremlin-loyalist MPs, are dismissing the entire report as a politically-based fabrication.
Russians on social media are making fun of its conclusions by using the hashtag ""PutinPossiblyApproved"" in Russian - that is #ПутинВозможноОдобрил - to include all manner of crimes.
One Russian MP, Nikolai Kovalev, himself an ex-FSB boss, pointed out relations between Moscow and London would not be harmed by the report as there was no room for making them any worse.
How Russian media reported the Litvinenko inquiry
Responding to the report, Mr Lugovoi, who is now a politician in Russia, said the accusations against him were ""absurd"", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying.
""As we expected, there were no surprises,"" he said.
""The results of the investigation made public today yet again confirm London's anti-Russian position, its blinkeredness and the unwillingness of the English to establish the true reason of Litvinenko's death.""
Mr Kovtun, now a businessman in Russia, said he would not comment on the report until he got more information about its contents, Interfax reported.
'Harm relations'
London's Metropolitan Police said the investigation into the ""cold and calculated murder"" remained ongoing.
Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador in the UK, said Russia would not accept any decisions reached in secret and based on evidence not tested in open court.
The length of time taken to come to these conclusions led them to believe it was ""a whitewash of British security services' incompetence"", he said.
Mr Yakovenko said these events ""can't help but harm our bilateral relations"".
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he did not have ""any actions"" to announce following the inquiry's findings. ""But I certainly wouldn't rule out future steps,"" he said.
Analysis

By BBC security correspondent, Gordon Corera
The conclusions of this inquiry are stronger than many expected in pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin personally.
The evidence behind that seems to have come from secret intelligence heard in closed session.
Saying that Alexander Litvinenko was killed because he was an enemy of the Russian state will raise pressure on the British government to take real action - the steps taken nearly a decade ago were only limited in scope.
That may pose difficulties given the importance of Russia's role in the Middle East, but without tough action people may ask if the Russian government has been allowed to get away with what has been described as an act of nuclear terrorism on the streets of London.
Mr Litvinenko fled to the UK in 2000, claiming persecution. He was granted asylum and gained British citizenship several years later.
In the years before his death, he worked as a writer and journalist, becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin.

It is believed he also worked as a consultant for MI6, specialising in Russian organised crime.
The inquiry heard from 62 witnesses in six months of hearings and was shown secret intelligence evidence about Mr Litvinenko and his links with British intelligence agencies.

544282005941530624,true,Hostages in Sydney cafe made to hold up Islamic flags http://t.co/I1PsUPekkB,http://nyp.st/16mRnXH,True,5 escape after gunman with jihadist flag takes at least 15 hostage in Sydney cafe,"SYDNEY — Five people escaped from a Sydney cafe where a gunman took an unknown number of hostages during Monday morning rush hour. Two people inside the cafe earlier held up a flag with an Islamic declaration of faith that has often been used by extremists, raising fears that a terrorist incident was playing out in the heart of Australia’s biggest city.
The first three people ran out of the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in downtown Sydney six hours into the hostage crisis, and two women sprinted from a fire exit into the arms of waiting police shortly afterward. Both women were wearing aprons with the Lindt chocolate logo, indicating they were cafe employees.
As the siege entered its 12th hour Monday night, basic questions remained unanswered. Police refused to say how many hostages were inside the cafe, what they believed the gunman’s motives might be, whether he had made any demands or whether the hostages who fled the cafe escaped or were released.
“I would like to give you as much as I can but right now that is as much as I can,” New South Wales state police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said. “First and foremost, we have to make sure we do nothing that could in any way jeopardize those still in the building.”
Police were negotiating with the gunman and said they had no information to suggest anyone had been hurt. Scipione said they had not confirmed whether the siege was related to terrorism.
“Our only goal tonight and for as long as this takes is to get those people that are currently caught in that building out of there safely,” he said.
Channel 10 news said it received a video in which a hostage inside the cafe had relayed the gunman’s demands. The station said police requested they not broadcast it, and Scipione separately asked all media that might be contacted by the gunman to urge him instead to talk to police.
The drama began around 9:45 a.m. in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city’s financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Many of those inside the cafe would have been taken hostage as they stopped in for their morning coffees.
Television video shot through the cafe’s windows showed several people with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass, and two people holding up a black flag with the Shahada, or Islamic declaration of faith, written on it.
The Shahada translates as “There is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger.” It is considered the first of Islam’s five pillars of faith, and is similar to the Lord’s Prayer in Christianity. It is pervasive throughout Islamic culture, including the green flag of Saudi Arabia. Jihadis have used the Shahada in their own black flag.
Seven Network television news staff watched the gunman and hostages for hours from a fourth floor window of their Sydney offices, opposite the cafe.
The gunman could be seen pacing back and forth past the cafe’s four windows. Reporter Chris Reason said the man carried what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun, was unshaven and wore a white shirt and a black cap.
Earlier in the day, network staff counted about 15 different faces among hostages forced up against the windows.
“The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,” Reason said in a report from the vantage point. “One woman we’ve counted was there for at least two hours — an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.”
“When we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,” he added.

Reason later reported that staff brought plates of food from a kitchen at the rear of the cafe and the hostages were fed.
As night set in, the lights inside the cafe were switched off. Armed police guarding the area outside fitted their helmets with green-glowing night goggles.
St. Vincent’s hospital spokesman David Faktor said a male hostage was in satisfactory condition in the hospital’s emergency department. He was the only one of the freed hostages to be taken to a hospital, and Scipione said he was being treated for a pre-existing condition.
Hundreds of police blanketed the city, streets were closed and offices evacuated. The public was told to stay away from Martin Place, site of the state premier’s office, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the headquarters of two of the nation’s largest banks. The state parliament house is a few blocks away.
Workers in the cordoned-off area were asked to stay home Tuesday, indicating police believe the hostage drama could stretch into the next day.
“This is a very disturbing incident,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. “It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.”
Lindt Australia posted a message on its Facebook page thanking the public for its support.
“We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,” the company wrote.
Infosys, India’s second-largest IT services provider, confirmed that one of its employees was among the hostages. The staffer’s family has been informed, it said.
Australia’s government raised the country’s terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia’s three largest cities — Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.
The Islamic State group, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, Islamic State group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani issued an audio message urging so-called “lone wolf” attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all “disbelievers,” whether they be civilians or soldiers.
One terrorism expert said the situation appeared to be that of a “lone wolf” making his own demands, rather than an attack orchestrated by a foreign jihadist group.
“There haven’t been statements from overseas linking this to extremist groups outside the country — that is quite positive,” said Charles Knight, lecturer in the Department of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism at Australia’s Macquarie University. “The individual or individuals involved didn’t kill early, which is part of the pattern of some recent international attacks. … It seems to be shifting more into the model of a traditional hostage situation, rather than the sort of brutal attacks we’ve seen overseas.”",8215

President Obama has issued executive orders to ban the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons. Here is what you need to know about the new rules. (Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post)
President Obama on Monday announced a ban on solitary confinement for juvenile offenders in the federal prison system, saying the practice is overused and has the potential for devastating psychological consequences.
In an op-ed that appears in Tuesday editions of The Washington Post, the president outlines a series of executive actions that also prohibit federal corrections officials from punishing prisoners who commit “low-level infractions” with solitary confinement.
The new rules also dictate that the longest a prisoner can be punished with solitary confinement for a first offense is 60 days, rather than the current maximum of 365 days.
The president’s reforms apply broadly to the roughly 10,000 federal inmates serving time in solitary confinement, though there are only a handful of juvenile offenders placed in restrictive housing each year. Between September 2014 and September 2015, federal authorities were notified of just 13 juveniles who were put in solitary in its prisons, officials said. However, federal officials sent adults inmates to solitary for nonviolent offenses 3,800 times in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2014, suggesting that policy change will have more sweeping ramifications.
The reforms come six months after Obama, as part of a broader criminal-justice reform push, ordered the Justice Department to study how solitary confinement was being used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

[Opinion | Obama explains why we must rethink solitary confinement]
The move is another example of the extent to which the nation’s first African American president now seems willing to tackle delicate questions of race and criminal justice as he closes out his presidency. Obama has also been focused on trying to put in place programs to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society once they have left prison.
“How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people?” Obama wrote in his op-ed. “It doesn’t make us safer. It’s an affront to our common humanity.”
He said he hoped his reforms at the federal level will serve as a model for states to rethink their rules on the issue.
At least a dozen states have taken steps in the past two years to curtail the use of solitary confinement, either in response to lawsuits or through legislative and administrative changes. An increasing number of studies show a connection between isolating prisoners and higher rates of recidivism.
In recent weeks, Illinois and Oregon, in response to lawsuits, have announced they will exclude seriously mentally ill inmates from solitary confinement, and last month New York state reached a five-year, $62 million settlement with the New York Civil Liberties Union in which it pledged to significantly cut the number of prisoners in solitary as well as the maximum time they could stay there. California reached a settlement in September, pledging to overhaul the way it treats almost 3,000 inmates who are frequently kept alone for more than 22 hours a day in their cells.
Amy Fettig, senior staff counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the group’s Stop Solitary Campaign, said that the Bureau of Prisons “has lagged behind a number of the states in reforming solitary confinement and in restricting its use and abuse.”
In a speech to members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in June 2015 where he called for criminal justice reform, President Obama said that solitary confinement ""is not going to make us safer."" (YouTube/The White House)
“It’s absolutely huge,” Fettig said of the president’s decision to change the way the federal system isolates inmates. “We rarely have presidents take notice of prison conditions.”
While Obama is leaving the details of policy implementation to agency officials, the Justice Department's report includes “50 guiding principles” that all federal correctional facilities must now follow. They include increasing the amount of time inmates placed in solitary can spend outside their cells, housing prisoners in the “least restrictive setting necessary” to ensure their safety and that of others, putting inmates who need to be in protective custody in less-restrictive settings and developing policies to discourage putting inmates in solitary during the last 180 days of their terms.
A congressionally mandated audit of restrictive housing in federal prisons, published last year by the Center for Naval Analyses’ Institute for Public Research, found that roughly 60 percent of the inmates whose solitary cases were reviewed had serious underdiagnosed or untreated mental illnesses. That study also found that many individuals put in protective custody for their own safety, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender prisoners and those who are disabled, were regularly placed in solitary confinement.
Some of the states that championed reforms early, including Washington, have found that prisoners placed in restrictive housing — especially just before their release — are more likely to be repeat offenders. One study found that Washington state prisoners who were confined in solitary had a 20 to 25 percent higher recidivism rate than those in less-restrictive housing, and that those who spent time in solitary directly before reentering society were more likely to commit violent crimes.
Early Tuesday morning, Senate Judiciary Committee Charles E Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a statement that while he’ll “be studying it over the next few days,” it appeared to be justified.
“At first glance I was happy to see an effort to end solitary confinement of juveniles,” Grassley said. “The good news is that the Judiciary Committee has already taken steps to minimize the solitary confinement of juveniles in both the Sentencing and Prison Reform bill and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act reauthorization that I authored.”
[What we do and don’t know about the impact of solitary confinement]
Kevin Ring, vice president of Fam­il­ies Against Man­dat­ory Min­im­ums, served 15 months in federal prison on fraud charges in connection with a a scandal surrounding former Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He spent two days in solitary in October because of a scabies outbreak in a Cumberland, Md., facility. Although the isolation was not designed to punish the inmates, Ring said guards took away all his possessions — including paper and pen — and put him in a small cell with just a metal bed, shower and small window. The lack of human contact was the most disorienting part, he said, since guards pushed a tray of food through a slot at assigned meal times and he could “only hear voices down the hall.”
“I don’t know how people do it. I’m not solitary material,” Ring said, adding that it should be used only “as a last resort.”
As many as 100,000 state and federal prisoners are held in solitary confinement in the United States at any given time, according to the White House.
The president begin his op-ed by recounting the story of 16-year-old Bronx resident Kalief Browder, who was sent to Rikers Island in 2010 to await trial after being accused of stealing a backpack. He “spent nearly two years in solitary ­confinement,” Obama wrote. Browder was released in 2013 without ever having stood trial or being convicted. He committed suicide at 22.
“Today, it’s increasingly overused on people like Kalief, with heartbreaking results — which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem,” Obama wrote. “In America, we believe in redemption.”",8172

The Islamic writing on the banner stoked fears that the crisis in Sydney could be linked to extremists. Australia, which is part of the international coalition fighting the terrorist group ISIS in the Middle East, said in September that it had foiled a plot by Islamic militants to carry out a public execution.
New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said it wasn't yet clear whether the situation at the cafe was a terrorist event but that police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert.""
Burn said police negotiators are now in contact with a hostage taker, who appears to have taken staff and customers captive as people were heading to work on Monday morning in the Martin Place area.
Chris Kenny, an editor at The Australian newspaper, said he was at the cafe Monday morning. He left shortly before the siege started.
""As police quickly swarmed and cleared the area, I turned to see a man against the window, facing out with his hands raised,"" he wrote in his account of the incident. ""At first I was relieved thinking this was the gunman responding to police -- but soon the awful realisation the customers were being forced against the windows.""
Seven Network reported that at least 13 people are being held at the cafe, but Scipione declined to say how many were in there.
Police barricaded off streets and evacuated buildings near the cafe, bringing an eerie quiet to a district typically buzzing with pedestrians and vehicles.

Thanks for checking this out.

ORIGIN
On 10 May 2016, British outlet The Telegraph reported that a Canadian teenager found a lost Mayan city using satellite mapping:
A Canadian schoolboy appears to have discovered a lost Mayan city hidden deep in the jungles of Mexico using a new method of matching stars to the location of temples on earth. William Gadoury, 15, was fascinated by the ancient Central American civilization and spent hours poring over diagrams of constellations and maps of known Mayan cities. And then he made a startling realisation: the two appeared to be linked … William took to Google Maps and projected that there must be another city hidden deep in the thick jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico[.] “I was really surprised and excited when I realised that the most brilliant stars of the constellations matched the largest Maya cities,” he told the Journal de Montréal. In hundreds of years of scholarship, no other scientist had ever found such a correlation.
That final line gave many readers pause — if the story was accurate, experts studying such history for decades missed the findings of a teenager. The article did little to inspire confidence in the claim’s credibility, noting that the boy’s study focus was inspired by 2012 Mayan doomsday prophecies:
The Canadian Space Agency agreed to train its satellite telescopes on the spot and returned with striking pictures: what appears to be an ancient Mayan pyramid and dozens of smaller structures around it. If the satellite photographs are verified, the city would be among the largest Mayan population centers ever discovered. It fell to William to christen the new city and he chose the name K’aak Chi, meaning Fire Mouth, and the teenager said he hoped to one day see the ruins with his own eyes. “It would be the culmination of my three years of work and the dream of my life,” he said. He became interested in the Mayans after reading about their predictions that the world would end in 2012.
The Telegraph sourced their report from a 7 May 2016 article on French-language web site Journal de Montréal. Both articles made essentially the same claims, with little effort at authenticating them. Both articles, too, lacked information about how such an astonishing discovery was deemed credible — or by whom. The narrative arc was vague and suggested that the boy requested further data from the Canadian Space Agency before connecting the dots himself.
Gawker‘s tech site Gizmodo was one of the first outlets to run with the story, only to later participate in its debunking. An assessment made by University of Southern California anthropologist Thomas Garrison was later added to Gizmodo‘s article in an update. Garrison said that the purported Maya ruins were, in fact, a fallow cornfield:
I applaud the young kid’s effort and it’s exciting to see such interest in the ancient Maya and remote sensing technology in such a young person. However, ground-truthing is the key to remote sensing research. You have to be able to confirm what you are identifying in a satellite image or other type of scene. In this case, the rectilinear nature of the feature and the secondary vegetation growing back within it are clear signs of a relic milpa. I’d guess its been fallow for 10-15 years. This is obvious to anyone that has spent any time at all in the Maya lowlands. I hope that this young scholar will consider his pursuits at the university level so that his next discovery (and there are plenty to be made) will be a meaningful one.
Ivan Šprajc of the Institute of Anthropological and Spatial Studies in Slovenia also voiced skepticism about the purported discovery:
Very few Maya constellations have been identified, and even in these cases we do not know how many and which stars exactly composed each constellation. It is thus impossible to check whether there is any correspondence between the stars and the location of Maya cities. In general, since we know of several environmental facts that influenced the location of Maya settlements, the idea correlating them with stars is utterly unlikely.
Other critiques voiced by archeologists in the wake of the claim’s spread on social media was that the area in which the site was “discovered” was already extensively mapped and excavated:
And no matter what your star map tells you, chances are good you’ll hit upon a settlement in that area. “The Maya area was so densely occupied in Classic Maya times that many years ago a well known archaeologist, Ed Kurjack, told me that the area looked much like the Ohio Valley, denuded of trees and full of towns that were fairly close to one another,” wrote Susan Milbrath, a curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History, in an email. “So at any given point you would be likely to find an archaeological site.” The archaeologist Richard Hansen pointed out that the location appears to be very close to that of the ancient Mayan city of Uxul, which has been under excavation since 2009—not exactly a long-lost city.
Ultimately, while the narrative of a plucky untrained teenager succeeding where the experts failed is always compelling, the “lost Mayan city” report was one of several science claims reported by the media only to be fact-checked by experts after the fact.
However, neither the way the story was reported initially nor its debunking were fully accurate. We spoke to the Daniel de Lisle with the Canadian Space Agency, who worked with William Gadoury on his project.
“We actually met William during the summer of 2014, because at that point [he] won a few science fairs with his project,” de Lisle told us:
So we attended his presentation and realized, this boy is really bright and really organized and had put together this project… and he was wondering why these temples, these pyramids were in odd places. So that’s how it started — he took the constellation maps and overlaid them over the map, and realized the constellations matched. So that’s really what triggered all this work. He realized that one major star did not have a correlation with a city on the map so he said maybe there could be something under neath the vegetation. so that’s really the basis of his research. We invited him to CSA to make a presentation, and he made a really thorough presentation about this. They really were in awe with this 15 year old boy. The other thing we did was provide satellite imagery where he was, and from there I processed the imagery so he could overlay this information…. The satellite imagery showed some edges that didn’t look natural; it showed straight edges. The images we have showed edges that are underneath the vegetation in relief. So he thought that there might be a city underneath the canopy.
William Gadoury’s projected uncovered what they called “an area of interest,” which suggested that there something underneath the vegetation. However, despite news reports to the contrary, the teenager never claimed to have found a lost city; instead, he formed a hypothesis based on available data that he had spent years researching and curating, so that experts could proceed from there.",7609

U.S. businesses have now added 15.0 million jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010, and the longest streak of total job growth on record continued in July. So far in 2016, job growth has averaged a solid 186,000 jobs a month, well above the pace needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate, and nominal hourly earnings for private employees have increased at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent so far in 2016, much faster than the pace of inflation. Nevertheless, more work remains to sustain faster wage growth and to ensure that the benefits of the recovery are broadly shared, including investing in infrastructure, implementing the high-standards Trans-Pacific Partnership, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing access to paid parental leave.
FIVE KEY POINTS ON THE LABOR MARKET IN JULY 2016
1. U.S. businesses have now added 15.0 million jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010. Today, we learned that private employment rose by 217,000 jobs in July, following a similarly robust gain of 259,000 jobs in June. Total nonfarm employment rose by 255,000 jobs in July, above the pace of recent months and substantially higher than the pace of about 80,000 jobs per month that CEA estimates is necessary to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate given the impact of demographic trends on labor force participation. Total job growth for May and June was revised up by a combined 18,000 jobs. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9 percent in July, and the labor force participation rate ticked up to 62.8 percent—the same rate as in October 2013 despite the aging of the U.S. population putting downward pressure on the participation rate. So far in 2016, nominal earnings for private-sector workers have increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, and wage growth over the past year is tied for the fastest twelve-month pace since the start of the recovery.
2. Nominal hourly earnings for private-sector workers have risen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent so far in 2016, well above the pace of inflation. Over the past twelve months, nominal hourly earnings for all private-sector workers have increased 2.6 percent, while consumer prices have risen just 1.0 percent over the past year (through June, the most recent data available). As the chart below shows, nominal hourly earnings have grown faster than consumer prices each year since 2012, translating into real wage gains for American workers. While nominal wage growth has been faster so far in 2016 than in 2015, consumer price inflation has picked up slightly as energy prices have moderated somewhat after falling sharply in 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless, real wage growth—a key component of rising living standards—has broadly picked up over the last three years as the recovery in the U.S. labor market has strengthened.
3. Broader measures of labor underutilization have steadily improved, and most are below pre-recession averages, although the broadest measure remains slightly elevated. The headline unemployment rate, the U-3 rate—which includes unemployed persons who have looked for work in the last month—has fallen from a peak of 10.0 percent in 2009 to 4.9 percent in July, below its pre-recession average. Broader measures of labor underutilization tell a similar story. These measures each include a progressively broader group of individuals: U-4 counts discouraged workers in addition to the unemployed, U-5 adds in others who are marginally attached to the labor force, and U-6 also includes people working part-time who would prefer a full-time job (“part-time for economic reasons”). All of these measures also saw large increases during the recession, with the U-6 rate in particular reaching a record high. However, U-3, U-4, and U-5 all recovered fully to their respective pre-recession averages in the summer of 2015 and have fallen further since. The U-6 rate—which ticked up to 9.7 percent in July—is now the only broader measure of labor underutilization that remains above its pre-recession average. This remaining elevation is entirely attributable to the fact that, despite steady improvement, the large increase in people working part-time for economic reasons in the recession has not been fully reversed.
4. The college earnings premium—the ratio of earnings for those with a college degree to earnings for those with a high school degree—has risen over the last four decades, highlighting the continued importance of investing in higher education. As discussed in a recent CEA report, the college earnings premium has reached historical highs in recent years, reflecting a trend over several decades of increasing relative demand for skilled workers. In 2014, the median full-time, full-year worker over age 25 with a bachelor’s degree earned nearly 70 percent more than a similar worker with just a high school degree. Moreover, those with a college degree are more likely to be employed: in July 2016, Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher were 18 percentage points more likely to be employed than high school graduates. As a result, higher education may be the single most important investment that young Americans can make in their futures. While these data suggest that the overall return to a college education is near historic highs, there is meaningful variation across individuals, largely related to the schools students attend and the programs they select. In particular, evidence suggests that the relatively low returns at for-profit colleges are increasingly becoming a cause for concern, especially given the high rates of borrowing by students at those schools. The rise in student loan debt in recent years has created challenges for some borrowers, and the Administration has taken steps—including creating options like the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, which caps monthly student loan payments at 10 percent of discretionary income—to help borrowers manage debt after college.
5. The distribution of job growth across industries in July was consistent with recent trends. Above-average gains relative to the past year were seen in industries such as financial activities (+18,000), professional and business services (+53,000, excluding temporary help services), and State and local government (+35,000). Most other industries grew in July at roughly the same pace as in the last twelve months, though private educational services (-14,000) and wholesale trade (+2,000) saw weaker-than-average growth. Manufacturing still faces global headwinds, but showed somewhat better growth in July (+9,000) compared to the past year, and mining and logging (which includes oil extraction) posted a smaller loss (-7,000) than in recent months. Across the 17 industries shown below, the correlation between the most recent one-month percent change and the average percent change over the last twelve months was 0.84, somewhat above the average correlation over the last two years.
As the Administration stresses every month, the monthly employment and unemployment figures can be volatile, and payroll employment estimates can be subject to substantial revision. Therefore, it is important not to read too much into any one monthly report, and it is informative to consider each report in the context of other data as they become available.",7493

Thanks for listening to another week of the Ask Pastor John podcast. We get a lot of really good questions via email, and you can send them to us at askpastorjohn AT desiringGod DOT org.
As you can imagine, Pastor John, we have lots of questions in the inbox about Target’s new transgender bathroom policy. Shoppers are encouraged to use whichever gendered bathrooms they identify with. The Target corporate headquarters is just a walk away from your house, so this hits close to home. On the principle of a boycotts, I think we’ve addressed this (back in episode 430 on corporate policies of Apple, Subaru, Target). What are the logistics of Target’s decision for Christians? If you are shopping at Target, go to the restroom, and a woman, identifying as a man, walks in — are there any biblical principles at play here? Would you use a gender-open restroom, even if it says “men” on the door? How would you untangle this?
Tony, the way my mind went on this may not be exactly where the question is going, although I am going to end precisely answering the question what I would do. But let me take you on the trajectory of my thought and trust that the Lord brought it to my mind for good reasons.
SCOTUS and Parenting
Strange as it may sound, the first thing that comes to my mind as I hear the question is how parents are going to train their children in a culture where profound evil and deep corruption and God-ignoring perversion is pervasive and accepted and defended and assumed and de-stigmatized and statistically normal. That is just so front burner for me right now in conversations that I am having.
“The depths of the human heart’s depravity must be built in profoundly to our children.” Twitter Tweet Facebook Share on Facebook
For those of us who grew up where different standards were assumed and where some at least external biblical patterns of life were normative, there is a built-in revulsion at some things that ought to produce revulsion. But our children are not growing up in that world, and they will not have the same instincts. So how — that is my question — how are we going to raise them and train them so that they will feel the exceeding sinfulness of sin and be willing to take stands that are extremely unpopular, maybe even costly or dangerous?
Part of the answer to that question is whether we have a big enough doctrine of human depravity. Are we able to take our children to the Scriptures and explain to them in terms that are shocking enough where the evils of our society are coming from? The children are going to be told by the Supreme Court and by their teachers and by their friends that the world is a different way, that the words of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy are true.
Here is this sentence. What I am going to read right now, I think, is probably the most destructive sentence, whether it is transgender or so-called gay marriage or abortion. This sentence from 1992 Justice Anthony Kennedy is probably the most destructive sentence that the Court has ever spoken. That would be my guess. I have not read them all, but he said, “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” That view of human autonomy — defining one’s own existence — is so widespread that, unless we have a deeper, stronger, more compelling view of human nature that explains where such sentences come from, our children will simply be swept away and along with the culture.
So that is the first thing that comes to my mind. My first reaction when I hear another instance of the kind of application of Justice Kennedy’s sentence is that the depths of the human heart’s depravity must be built in profoundly to our children.
So-Called “Gender Identity”
The second thing that comes to my mind is just to make sure that we have our terminology right in these days. So Target has now put in place a policy and it goes like this. It aims to give freedom to “transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.” Now there is the new term: gender identity. And it is just so important that all of our listeners get this. That is a new code word.
The word “gender” is now used not for biological reality of maleness or femaleness, but for desired identity of so-called male or so-called female, even if the biological reality is the opposite of the desired identity. So, gender identity can mean a male declaring himself to be female and a female declaring herself to be male. That is what gender identity means. And it is the most recent application and perhaps the strangest of Justice Kennedy’s principle: Liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence.
Always criticizing the world and losing a big vision of God is a greater tragedy than the moral tragedy we are in. Twitter Tweet Facebook Share on Facebook
We are going to talk about polygamy on this podcast one of these days, and my wife was saying last night: Well, that probably isn’t coming. I said: There is not a leg to stand on. Once you have put this sentence in place, polygamy will come and the worst has already come. Polygamy is a piece of cake. That is coming, except that it is probably legally so complicated that, for inheritances and life insurance policies and everything else, maybe there will be some brakes on it for a while anyway.
For this principle to hold, liberty is the right to define one’s own existence. God must be excluded from the picture, because what it means to be God is that God defines for us the nature of our existence. And so the recent developments to presume we can define marriage any way we please and our sexual identity any way we please are manifestations of the human usurpation of divine prerogatives. This is not new, not a new thing. This has been going on for a long time. The correlation between biological maleness and femaleness and self-identification as male and female is rooted in numerous ways in the Bible. It is rooted in God’s creation as male and female. It is rooted in distinct roles assigned to male and female in marriage. It is rooted in the biblical prohibition of homosexual acts.
Target, Transgender, and Bathrooms
So, in answer to the last part of the question, Would you, John Piper, use a gender open restroom even if it says men on the door? My answer is, If I were there and if I had to, I would — just like I would stop on the highway if I had to. But I wouldn’t if I didn’t have to. And the reason I wouldn’t is because I want there to be a small act of protest and life consistency that may have no impact at all on the powers that make such decisions, but that keep my conscience clear and acknowledge God in practical affairs and give a consistency to my life that does help overall in showing the way of Christ to the world.
And I would say just one other thing. I think we should spend most of our creative energies on constructing in our minds and in our hearts and in our families great and beautiful and glorious alternative visions of reality than the ones we are being offered by the world. If we give most of our time to bemoaning and criticizing the world for acting like the world, our vision of God and his glorious future for his people will become smaller and smaller, and that could be a greater tragedy than the one we are living in.

The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24,a reservist from Hamilton.
Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.
It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.
CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspectis Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.
He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.
In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.
""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.
""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair andLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.

Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.
Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.
Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.
Caught 'by surprise'
In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""
""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.
Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.
Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.
Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.
Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.
Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""
Chaos and bravery inside Parliament
Alain Merisier, who works at the cafeteria in one of the Parliament Buildings, told CBC News that he saw a man in a car at the Centre Block with a long gun.

CBC video and cellphone video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed a chaotic scene in the elegant hallway leading from the front doors of Parliament's Centre Block to the Library of Parliament during the attack.
A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.
In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:
NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""
Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, former head of the Ontario Provincial Police and ex-Toronto chief of police: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.""
Justice Minister Peter MacKay: ""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes.""
Eyewitness accounts
Earlier, police sealed off the area around the National War Memorial while the injured soldier was given emergency medical aid.
""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" said Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist visiting downtown Ottawa from Holland.

Raivo Nommick, another bystander, said ""all of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle .... and just pow pow.
""Then I saw one of the other Armed Forces guys just running. He barrelled over, just ran right over. The other guy just dropped. I looked back and just dived underneath and immediately called 911.""

In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""
""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.
Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.
Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.
Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.
Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.
Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""

524925050739490816,true,BREAKING NEWS: Soldier shot at National War Memorial in Ottawa http://t.co/pp6hcfWcRw,http://www.cbc.ca/1.2808710,True,"Ottawa shooting: A day of chaos leaves soldier, gunman dead","Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.
The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24,a reservist from Hamilton.
Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.
It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.
CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspectis Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.
He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.
In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.
""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.
""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair andLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.

Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.
Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.

767709416879644672,non-rumor,"""I hate writing; I love having written."" Dorothy Parker was born on this day in 1893: https://t.co/1LtUU6Eyla",http://nyti.ms/2bGvBly,True,The Eternally Quotable Dorothy Parker,"This is the story of Cassius Marcellus Clay — not that Cassius Clay, the heavyweight fighter and luminous worldwide presence best known as Muhammad Ali.
This story is about the original Cassius Clay: the 19th-century scion of a slaveholding family who became a belligerent emancipationist, globe-trotting statesman, unsparing duelist, early Republican and larger-than-life American eccentric.
It was for that Cassius Clay, who died on July 22, 1903, at the Kentucky plantation house where he had been born 92 years earlier, that Ali’s father and, by extension, Ali himself were named.
A firebrand publisher, Yale-educated lawyer, Kentucky state legislator, major general in the Union Army, survivor of multiple assassination attempts and the United States minister to Russia under Presidents Lincoln and Johnson, General Clay was as well known for his private activities as for his public ones.
His obituary in The New York Times, published on July 23, 1903, is remarkable for a level of catty candor rarely seen in American news obituaries of the era — traditionally staid, reverential documents — and, very likely, of any era.
“He was found desperately ill, and has had every care,” the opening paragraph reads. “His children, long estranged by reason of his eccentricities, were again able to be with him, and were at the bedside when death ensued.”
Things get more delicious from there.
There was General Clay’s prolific dueling, which left him with a tangle of scars on his face and body but left his opponents far worse off: He was said to have slain more men in duels than anyone else in the country.
On one occasion, caught without his pistol, General Clay was shot above the heart by a would-be assassin. He forestalled further ado by slicing off the assailant’s nose and ears with a Bowie knife.
Then there was General Clay’s precipitate divorce from his first wife of 45 years, Mary Jane Warfield, and his equally precipitate second marriage — made, he insisted, on populist political grounds — to a 15-year-old servant girl. He was 84 at the time.
“In 1837 he had married his first wife, Miss Warfield, a member of an aristocratic family of slave holders,” the Times obituary said. “Years afterward, when he had become an ardent disciple of Tolstoï, he came to the conclusion that he ought to wed a ‘daughter of the people.’ ”
And so he did, taking Dora Richardson as his bride in 1894. “Gen. Clay Weds Pretty Dora,” a headline in The Times proclaimed. “His Children Were Unable to Prevent Their Aged Parent’s Marriage.”
Young Dora, who evidently had little say in the matter of her betrothal, did not take kindly to being yoked to a man more than five times her age. She ran away repeatedly from home and from the boarding school to which her husband sent her.
“The fact that he supplied her with the most beautiful French gowns and lavished money upon her, she did not consider compensation for the teasing she got at the hands of her fellow-pupils,” The Times said. “In two months he had to take her back home, still uneducated.”
After four years of Dora’s comings and goings, which were avidly covered in the newspapers, General Clay divorced her.
She remarried “a worthless young mountaineer,” The Times reported, but after he was killed in a railway accident, the general tried vigorously to win back “his peasant wife,” as he fondly called her.
In this endeavor, unlike most others, he did not succeed.
The youngest son of Gen. Green Clay and the former Sally Lewis, Cassius Marcellus Clay was born on Oct. 19, 1810, at White Hall, his family’s mansion near Richmond, Ky.
His father (1757-1828) had been a hero of the Revolutionary War and was a general in the War of 1812; Henry Clay, the United States senator and statesman, was a cousin. Both of Cassius’ parents were from the Southern landed gentry, making the family among the wealthiest landowners in the state.
At Yale, Cassius Clay heard a speech by the famed abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and was converted to the cause. Returning home after earning a law degree in 1832, he established a practice in Lexington, served three terms in the Kentucky General Assembly and was a captain in the 1st Kentucky Cavalry in the Mexican War.
In 1844, he freed his own slaves and the next year started The True American, an emancipationist newspaper published in Lexington.
His proposals for gradually ending slavery, which he also promulgated in public lectures, did not go over well in Kentucky. He kept a cannon on hand to protect the newspaper office from looming mobs and weathered several more attempts on his life.
General Clay, who in the 1850s helped establish the Republican Party, was a friend and staunch supporter of Abraham Lincoln. After the outbreak of the Civil War, he organized the Cassius M. Clay Battalion, a corps of several hundred volunteers charged with protecting the White House.
In 1861, Lincoln appointed him minister to Russia, a post he held through the following year and again from 1863 to 1869. Dispatched to St. Petersburg, General Clay was instrumental in brokering the deal that in 1867 let the United States purchase Alaska.
The general’s later life was a sorry state of affairs. Barricaded in White Hall with a veritable arsenal beside him, he pined for the faithless Dora and worried obsessively that enemies, real and imagined, were coming to kill him.
“Gen. Clay May Be Insane,” a headline in The Times declared on July 4, 1903, followed, five days later, by the more definitive “Gen. Clay Decreed Insane.”
“Though his sight became so much impaired that he could not shoot any longer,” The Times reported in his obituary, “he kept plenty of firearms at his elbow, and kept trained from a porthole in the wall the same brass cannon he had caused to be built to protect his printing office.”
But the vital legacy of General Clay’s early life has endured down the years. He fathered a string of children — as many as 10 in some estimates — most with his first wife, although at least one with a St. Petersburg mistress. Two daughters, Mary Barr Clay (1839-1924) and Laura Clay (1849-1941), became leaders of the women’s suffrage movement.
In 1853, he donated the land for what became Berea College in Berea, Ky. Established two years later, it was the first interracial and coeducational college in the South, open to blacks and to women from its inception.
General Clay was buried in Richmond Cemetery, in Richmond, Ky., and his funeral was newsworthy for the racially mixed crowd in attendance.
“Never was a more striking scene witnessed on the way to Richmond, where the funeral services were to be held,” a contemporary newspaper account read. “From every humble Negro cottage along the roadside and at every cross roads, the mothers and large children carrying those who were too little to walk, the Negroes were lined up to pay their last respects to the man whom they honored as the Abraham Lincoln of Kentucky.”
In the end, then, its garrulous chronicle of its subject’s peccadilloes notwithstanding, the obituary of Cassius Marcellus Clay is every inch a requiem for a heavyweight.

Related Inside David Bowie's Final Years How Bowie stepped away – and came roaring back
I first saw David Bowie play live in '83 on the Let's Dance tour. At that point, he was in his mid-thirties, but he already had the weight of a legend. It was at the US Festival in San Bernardino, and there were maybe 100,000 people. He really stood out to me even as a child because there was this gravitas and weight that really set him apart; it was like seeing Sinatra or Elvis.
The way he anchored a stage was striking. He could do so much with so little, he could just be there to hold the audience. I don't hear this mentioned a lot — maybe there's a hint of it in that clip of him with Bing Crosby — but I always thought of Bowie as kind of a bridge from the era of the crooner to the rock frontman. He somehow straddled those two worlds in a way that nobody else did, bringing that effortless worldliness and marry it with the rock frontman. When I heard Elvis' song ""Black Star,"" that reference made Bowie's ""Blackstar"" resonate deeper than I could imagine. I can imagine somebody growing up in the Fifties, and that song capturing the sort of Elvis-by-way-of-Hollywood version of an Old West mythic figure, that sort of lone rider on the plains, with mortality hanging above them. Those are some of the most difficult things to express in art.
When I saw that show, I was at that age when girls had David Bowie's picture on their binder at school. He was a real genuine pop star, but he was more interesting than the other ones. You could sense that there was more going on than just a song that's on the radio and an eye-catching video. He could extrapolate what was vital and elemental in music, but somehow edit out the things that would make it more dated or disposable, and reduce it down to something that was art, something unassailable and crystalline. Today, you can hear a great ballad on the radio, but then you listen to something like ""Changes."" Its a ballad, but it has world-weariness. It has an angst; it has a wistfulness; it has sentimentality; and it has anger. Its really a cocktail of things and, again and again, you find that in his work. Its not just one dimension.
David Bowie started making records around the beginning of my life, and his career kind of tracks with my life. There's always been a David Bowie record. He's always been doing something. He's always been kind of guidepost or gravitational force for me. He's someone that you set course to or measure what you're doing against. If you're working on something intently and you don't know if it's complete garbage or a waste of time, there are certain works or artists you look to and go, ""How far off course am I here? Because I know that's good. That's the top of the mountain, and are we going the opposite way here?""

He was really one of those figures to a lot of musicians. I think that has a lot to do with his singular approach to what he did, which was to take from theater, literature, pop culture, avant-garde and create this modern concept that maybe began with Sgt. Pepper's, where you're bringing in all these mediums together and creating something new and three-dimensional. For me, as a working musician, I have always been in awe of how he was able to manage to write these classic songs and create a sort of visual language around each body of music; these ambitious stage productions, iconic videos and imagery. To do one is really a full-time endeavor. You got the idea of a mad scientist, somebody in the laboratory who's sort of lost all sense of place and time. Believe me, I've been there, where you haven't slept in months and you're just kind of a mess, but he was able to do it with this kind of calm, effortlessness about it that is really interesting. I've worked with people that have worked with him, and I've heard he'd come in and just kind of come up with something and sing it once or twice and be done. It doesn't conjure up the typical struggle and Sturm und Drang of trying to get great art. When an artistic presence infuses so much, when that person's gone, there's such a tremendous absence that it almost feels like losing family.
My real entry point was Hunky Dory when I was 12. I listened to it for years, especially when I was starting to play music. But over the years, I appreciated all of it. He really was making art out of his life at every turn. I've really enjoyed his personal work, but also the ones with kind of artifice and façade, a song like ""Fashion."" I have a real fondness for Let's Dance, too. Theres something very Fifties about it, but it is also something very modern and exotic and fun. In a lot of his great songs, there's a plasticity and control, and then there's a point where he just loses it and his voice breaks and it almost goes a bit manic and punk, and it goes a little farther than you thought it was gonna go. There's something so gratifying about that, you know. It always made me feel bad when I would see that he would dismiss Let's Dance. It's like the work of somebody who works abstract for years and then they go to paint something very simple and something figurative, and it just has an indisputable power that someone just trying to write a straight-ahead radio song wouldn't have.
Low is another one of my favorites. Its almost like you're hearing something new being born in that record — out of krautrock and electronic and the sort of nascent punk and all the sounds in that record. I covered ""Sound and Vision"" a couple years ago with almost 200 other musicians. It was surreal and insane trying to get that many people to play together at the same time. I never heard anything from him about it, but I hope that it didnt make him cringe or anything. I know he was particular, and its always strange to hear one of your songs covered. It can be a great thing or it could be a terrible thing.
I spoke with him a few times. He was one of my favorite conversations ever. He had an electrical conversational wit and was familiar and conversant on so many things. He had an intellect that was so alive and so engaged. It's very rare. He was just right there on everything: art, music, new bands, comic books, Japanese temples. It was just everything.
I did some remixes for him at one point, and I would have loved to have done more and just been around him more. I wish we could have collaborated. We sent some messages back and forth, and we had some very vague conversations about possibly doing something at some point, and I just figured there would be a right time and place. That would be a dream project for me. Not necessarily because I had anything that he needed; it was just purely a musician wanting to be around a master. His creative energy was something powerful to be around.

When #Obama Has All Your Personal Information

http://t.co/oIEI47f4hQ http://t.co/yWtL0mumZG",http://nypost.com/2015/07/18/obama-has-been-collecting-personal-data-for-a-secret-race-database/,True,Obama collecting personal data for a secret race database,"A key part of President Obama’s legacy will be the fed’s unprecedented collection of sensitive data on Americans by race. The government is prying into our most personal information at the most local levels, all for the purpose of “racial and economic justice.”
Unbeknown to most Americans, Obama’s racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health, home loans, credit cards, places of work, neighborhoods, even how their kids are disciplined in school — all to document “inequalities” between minorities and whites.
This Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases, which Obama already is using to make “disparate impact” cases against: banks that don’t make enough prime loans to minorities; schools that suspend too many blacks; cities that don’t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds.
Big Brother Barack wants the databases operational before he leaves office, and much of the data in them will be posted online.
So civil-rights attorneys and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of “racial disparities” and “segregation,” even if no other evidence of discrimination exists.
Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history.
Housing database
The granddaddy of them all is the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing database, which the Department of Housing and Urban Development rolled out earlier this month to racially balance the nation, ZIP code by ZIP code. It will map every US neighborhood by four racial groups — white, Asian, black or African-American, and Hispanic/Latino — and publish “geospatial data” pinpointing racial imbalances.
The agency proposes using nonwhite populations of 50% or higher as the threshold for classifying segregated areas.
Federally funded cities deemed overly segregated will be pressured to change their zoning laws to allow construction of more subsidized housing in affluent areas in the suburbs, and relocate inner-city minorities to those predominantly white areas. HUD’s maps, which use dots to show the racial distribution or density in residential areas, will be used to select affordable-housing sites.
HUD plans to drill down to an even more granular level, detailing the proximity of black residents to transportation sites, good schools, parks and even supermarkets. If the agency’s social engineers rule the distance between blacks and these suburban “amenities” is too far, municipalities must find ways to close the gap or forfeit federal grant money and face possible lawsuits for housing discrimination.
Civil-rights groups will have access to the agency’s sophisticated mapping software, and will participate in city plans to re-engineer neighborhoods under new community outreach requirements.
“By opening this data to everybody, everyone in a community can weigh in,” Obama said. “If you want affordable housing nearby, now you’ll have the data you need to make your case.”
Mortgage database
Meanwhile, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, headed by former Congressional Black Caucus leader Mel Watt, is building its own database for racially balancing home loans. The so-called National Mortgage Database Project will compile 16 years of lending data, broken down by race, and hold everything from individual credit scores and employment records.
Mortgage contracts won’t be the only financial records vacuumed up by the database. According to federal documents, the repository will include “all credit lines,” from credit cards to student loans to car loans — anything reported to credit bureaus. This is even more information than the IRS collects.
The FHFA will also pry into your personal assets and debts and whether you have any bankruptcies. The agency even wants to know the square footage and lot size of your home, as well as your interest rate.
FHFA will share the info with Obama’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which acts more like a civil-rights agency, aggressively investigating lenders for racial bias.
The FHFA has offered no clear explanation as to why the government wants to sweep up so much sensitive information on Americans, other than stating it’s for “research” and “policymaking.”
However, CFPB Director Richard Cordray was more forthcoming, explaining in a recent talk to the radical California-based Greenlining Institute: “We will be better able to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns.”
Credit database
CFPB is separately amassing a database to monitor ordinary citizens’ credit-card transactions. It hopes to vacuum up some 900 million credit-card accounts — all sorted by race — representing roughly 85% of the US credit-card market. Why? To sniff out “disparities” in interest rates, charge-offs and collections.
Employment database
CFPB also just finalized a rule requiring all regulated banks to report data on minority hiring to an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. It will collect reams of employment data, broken down by race, to police diversity on Wall Street as part of yet another fishing expedition.
School database
Through its mandatory Civil Rights Data Collection project, the Education Department is gathering information on student suspensions and expulsions, by race, from every public school district in the country. Districts that show disparities in discipline will be targeted for reform.
Those that don’t comply will be punished. Several already have been forced to revise their discipline policies, which has led to violent disruptions in classrooms.
Obama’s educrats want to know how many blacks versus whites are enrolled in gifted-and-talented and advanced placement classes.
Schools that show blacks and Latinos under-enrolled in such curricula, to an undefined “statistically significant degree,” could open themselves up to investigation and lawsuits by the department’s Civil Rights Office.
Count on a flood of private lawsuits to piggyback federal discrimination claims, as civil-rights lawyers use the new federal discipline data in their legal strategies against the supposedly racist US school system.
Even if no one has complained about discrimination, even if there is no other evidence of racism, the numbers themselves will “prove” that things are unfair.
Such databases have never before existed. Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history. He is creating a diversity police state where government race cops and civil-rights lawyers will micromanage demographic outcomes in virtually every aspect of society.
The first black president, quite brilliantly, has built a quasi-reparations infrastructure perpetually fed by racial data that will outlast his administration.

Hillary Clinton defeated Bernie Sanders in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, in a much-needed victory that nonetheless revealed vulnerabilities in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
With the majority of precincts reporting, Clinton had 52.7% of the vote, to Sanders’ 47.2%. After a race that initially appeared to be neck-and-neck, the result was called by the Associated Press shortly after 2.20pm local time.
The former secretary of state will seize on her win in the desert state as the start of her comeback in the Democratic race, in which she was first held to an effective tie by Sanders in Iowa and then was easily defeated by him in New Hampshire.
Also on Saturday, the Republicans have been voting in South Carolina, where Donald Trump is expected to win, although his poll lead has narrowed in recent days.
There were ecstatic scenes at the Clinton victory party. “Some may have doubted us but we never doubted each other,” Clinton told supporters at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas.
She congratulated Sanders on a hard-fought race, but added a barely-concealed criticism of her adversary. “The truth is, we aren’t a single-issue country,” she said. “We need more than a plan for the big banks; the middle class needs a raise.”
“I am on my way to Texas, Bill is on his way to Colorado,” she said, in a nod to the slew of crucial primary contests due to take place on 1 March, known as Super Tuesday. “The fight is on, the future that we want is within our grasp.”
The reference in her speech to Bill Clinton coincided with the former president’s increasing role in the family campaign to retake the White House. In a pointed campaign moment in Nevada, Bill Clinton locked horns with Sanders, implicitly comparing his populism to that of the conservative Tea Party. The Vermont senator hit back, attacking the former president’s trade deals, Wall Street deregulation and “so-called welfare reforms”.
In his concession speech on Saturday, Sanders struck an upbeat tone, claiming “the wind is at our backs” despite the defeat in Nevada – pointing out how far his opponent’s lead in the Nevada polls had shrunk. “Five weeks ago, we were 25 points behind in the polls,” he said. “We have made some real progress.”
He added: “I believe on Super Tuesday we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.”
Clinton’s win comes with at least 19 of Nevada’s 35 delegates, adding to her already significant lead in that count, mostly from the support of superdelegates.
The Democratic race will first head to South Carolina, where Clinton has enjoyed a formidable 20-point lead in recent polls, and where her backing from African Americans, a key demographic in the state, is stronger than her support from Latinos.

The Clinton camp hoped that her disappointing showing in the predominantly white early nominating states would quickly be erased once the nomination process moved to states like Nevada and South Carolina, which have a more mixed ethnic and racial makeup.
That turned out to be only partly true in Nevada. Even though Clinton clinched the vote by a comfortable margin, NBC exit poll data indicated she had actually lost the vote of the state’s key demographic of Latino voters. Sanders won 53% of the Latino vote, according to the sample data, compared to Clinton’s 45%. That is a worrying result for Clinton, who has staked her campaign on the promise of winning minority voters.
Some Latino voters, particularly younger people and low-wage workers, appeared to be opting for Sanders in the final weeks of the campaign. In the final 48 hours of the campaign, the Clinton camp ramped up a negative push against Sanders, questioning his commitment to Latinos and portraying the former secretary of state as the obvious heir to the diverse coalition that elected Barack Obama.
In the end Clinton’s strength among women, older voters and African Americans – as well as those who said they were looking for experience in their nominee – proved decisive.
“I love that she’s a woman,” said Darlene Gerson, an attorney caucusing for Clinton at Del Webb middle school in Henderson, in southeast Las Vegas. “I agree with the vast majority of her views. She knows what she’s doing. If anyone can compromise, she can. She’s hugely more electable.”
Nevada’s result lends weight to that view, and shifts momentum behind Clinton’s campaign at a critical juncture.
For the Sanders campaign, Saturday’s result in Nevada will be considered a setback, but not one without positive signs, having significantly dented the lead of a candidate once considered the party’s presumed nominee.
Even if Sanders wins the popular vote, Clinton could still get the nomination Read more
In a repeat of Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had his strongest showing amid young people, who have flocked to his promise of tuition-free college and a platform of radical political and economic change in America.
In the northern city of Reno, where Sanders performed more strongly, there was overwhelming support for the senator at the University of Nevada caucus site.
“I know that the campus culture here is all about Bernie Sanders,” said Olivia Komanduri, an 18-year-old student supporting Clinton, adding she was disappointed but not surprised that she lost there. “They love the idea of a political revolution, they want someone who is different like Bernie, but they don’t understand that Hillary is different, too.”

The Democratic race still remains tight, with Clinton and Sanders each having won one state and effectively tying in the other.
But after a disappointing start to her 2016 campaign, Clinton will claim momentum is now on her side. In addition to her lead in South Carolina, which holds its Democratic primary later this month, Clinton appears to be ahead in other states voting in early March.
She is leading in 10 of the 12 states that will hold Democratic primaries between 1 and 8 March, benefiting from overwhelming support of black voters, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released this week.
“Senator Sanders has run a very good campaign,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign’s director of communications. “He speaks very passionately to a lot of the anger - justifiably so - that people feel here. But we think that the longer the campaign goes on the more apparent it becomes as she makes her argument that she has solutions that will actually work and make a difference in people’s lives for all the barriers that hold them back.”",6989
693466724822323200,non-rumor,Audio recordings reveal CPR started 11 minutes after staff found Gynnya McMillen https://t.co/zGfD68YgfB https://t.co/s8cer8AMaT,http://cbsn.ws/1QNNgZ5,True,Audio: CPR started 11 minutes after staff found Gynnya McMillen,"NEW YORK — A sheriff’s deputy planning to transport 16-year-old Gynnya McMillen to court arrived at the Lincoln Village Juvenile Detention Center to pick her up at 9:55 a.m on Jan. 11.
When he arrived, staff at the small facility entered the cell where McMillen spent her one night at Lincoln Village alone. They realized she was “cold” and not breathing, according to emergency dispatch recordings obtained by CBS News.
Nine minutes passed between the deputy’s arrival and the first call to 911, at 10:04 a.m.
About 1 ½ minutes later, the emergency dispatcher asked a Lincoln Village nurse if CPR was being performed.
“No it’s not,” the nurse said.
“They want us to start CPR,” she can then be heard saying to someone at the facility.
“Do y’all have a CPR protocol or do y’all need it?” the dispatcher asked about 10 seconds later.
“I’m new, I can find out, I don’t know,” the nurse replied.
By 10:07, dispatch confirmed that CPR was beginning, and that McMillen was “cold to the touch.” Eight minutes later, an EMS supervisor radioed dispatch and declared McMillen dead. It is not clear if a defibrillator was used at any time. McMillen’s body was on the way to the county coroner by 11:33.
Since McMillen’s death, officials have indicated she likely died in her sleep, though no cause has yet been determined. Members of McMillen’s family have criticized the treatment she received from staff, both before and after her death.
“They have a duty to serve and perform. You start CPR. It doesn’t take 11 minutes to assess whether one is breathing or not,” said Dana McDuffie, whose fiance, Greg Mitchell, is McMillen’s brother.

Officials initially released few details about the circumstances of McMillen’s death, leading her sister to launch a social media campaign seeking answers.
A state official said Friday that on Jan. 10, the day before McMillen’s death, a Lincoln Village employee used an “Aikido restraint” on her. The martial arts technique was used because McMillen refused to remove her sweatshirt in order to be searched and photographed for booking.
“The staff performed an Aikido restraint hold to safely conduct a pat-down search and remove the youth’s hoodie,” wrote Stacy Floden, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice. “The purpose of having multiple staff involved in a controlled restraint is to ensure the safety of the youth and staff.”
The teen’s “repeated refusal to cooperate with staff and remove her outer garment prompted the restraint,” Floden wrote. A female staff member conducted the pat-down and removed the hoodie, she said.
It’s not clear if the “Aikido restraint” factored into McMillen’s death on Jan. 11. Her death is currently under investigation by the Kentucky State Troopers and the Justice Cabinet’s Internal Investigation’s Branch. McDuffie expressed frustration at the slow trickle of information released by officials since McMillen’s death.
“As you try and grieve in a proper effective manner, you keep thinking, ‘What’s going to come out next? They said one thing before and now it’s something else,’” McDuffie said Saturday.
Her sentiment was echoed by McMillen’s sister, LaChe Simms.
“It’s a lot to take in, it really is. It’s a lot process,” Simms said. “It still doesn’t make sense.”
Michele Deitch, an attorney and juvenile justice expert who lectures at the University of Texas at Austin, said Friday that youths in detention should only be restrained when there’s a risk of physical danger to themselves or others. Deitch criticized the use of martial arts in particular.
“I’ve never heard that phrase used in the context of a corrections setting,” Deitch said.
A chapter Deitch wrote in the National Institute of Corrections’ guide to working with youth in confinement covers “crisis management” for juveniles in detention.
“Situations in which there is not active violence, but a youth simply refuses to comply with an order or is passively resisting do not constitute an immediate necessity of force; policy should clarify this,” Deitch wrote in the the federal agency’s guide. “The continuum of force must offer options for staff--including separation of the youth from peers, verbal de-escalation, or the involvement of mental health staff--that do not involve hands-on measures.”
State police are not currently considering criminal charges in the case.
However, Reginald Windham, a Lincoln Village employee, was placed on paid administrative leave as a result of the internal investigation. Officials say Windham, who has been with the state’s juvenile justice department for 10 years, failed to check on McMillen every 15 minutes, a requirement for those in isolation at the detention center in Elizabethtown.
McMillen was placed in a cell by herself on Jan. 10, at some point after the Aikido incident. Officials previously confirmed to CBS News that McMillen did not respond the next morning when food was offered at 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., or later when her mother called.
In the nearly 3 ½ hours between when McMillen was first offered food and when the deputy arrived for her at 9:55, she was not checked on.
It is not clear when exactly she died.
Staff said McMillen’s failure to respond the morning of her death didn’t raise red flags, because “her silence was consistent with her behavior” after arriving at the facility, according to Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet spokesperson Lisa Lamb.
Liz Ryan, a juvenile justice consultant, and founder of the advocacy group Campaign for Youth Justice, said in an interview Wednesday that when McMillen missed breakfast, it should have immediately been a cause for concern.
“It’s common sense. It’s a reasonable expectation. Somebody should have gone in to check to make sure that she’s okay,” Ryan said.
She and Deitch noted that juvenile detention centers are not supposed to be punitive in nature, in part because they’re typically for youth who are pre-trial, and therefore not convicted of any crimes. Both said staff should seek to “engage” teenagers who are not communicative with staff.
McMillen was brought to Lincoln Village on Jan. 10 after she was charged with misdemeanor assault, following what police called a “domestic incident” at her mother’s home in Shelbyville, Ky. Officials say a court-designated worker -- a Kentucky official who handles pre-court processing related to juveniles -- made the recommendation that McMillen be brought to a detention center.
It is not clear why McMillen was alone in a cell or how often she was checked on throughout the night. In Kentucky, youths in isolation must have video surveillance at all times. That footage has been turned over to investigators.
Last week, Kentucky Justice Cabinet Secretary John Tilley requested the investigations be expedited along with McMillen’s autopsy.",6848
775672628493357057,unverified,Clinton Hides Failing Health? Full Disclosure Now:  Covert Doctors and Nurses https://t.co/s05sw7eK8a via @MailOnline #MAGA @realDonaldTrump,http://dailym.ai/2cAoqQj,True,Hillary Clinton's nurse appears to check pulse before her collapse at 9/11 memorial,"Hillary Clinton is facing new questions over whether she brought her personal doctor, Lisa Bardack, to the 9/11 memorial where she collapsed.
The Democratic candidate had a woman at her side throughout her time there - and as she was escorted away, the woman appeared to check Clinton's pulse.
She also held Clinton's hand in a way which it has been suggested may have been some sort of neurological test.
The woman was also seen whispering in Clinton's ear in a video taken of VIPs at the commemoration.
A series of Twitter users have questioned whether it is Dr Lisa Bardack, the physician who diagnosed her with pneumonia.
Taking her pulse? Questions have been raised over whether the woman seen here on NBC footage of Clinton at the memorial was checking her vital signs and therefore medically trained
Holding her hand: A photograph of the immediate seconds after Clinton left the front row of the memorial shows the woman holding the candidate's hand
Diagnosis: Dr Lisa Bardack, who confirmed on Sunday that Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday. It has been suggested that she was at Clinton's side at the memorial
Present throughout: The woman was with Clinton as she arrived for Sunday's 9/11 commemoration ceremony. Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but kept it secret
Close to the candidate: As Clinton made her way through the crowd, the woman was close by
Clinton-whisperer: As names beginning with the letter B were read out at the ceremony, the woman whispered at length in Clinton's ear
Front-row place: Clinton was beside New York senator Chuck Schumer (left) and in the same row as (from right) Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor; Donald Trump, her presidential rival, Rudolph Giliuani, New York mayor during 9/11; Bill de Blasio, the city's current mayor; and Michael Bloomberg, the mayor in between Giuliani and de Blasio
The presence of someone with medical training would raise concern that Clinton went to the event knowing her health was at risk.
She is already facing criticism for keeping her diagnosis with pneumonia two days earlier secret - and for her campaign taking hours to admit the truth.
The campaign's changing story on Sunday saw aides claim first that she was 'overheated' and then that she was suffering because of heat and humidity - on a day in New York which other people thought was a pleasant late summer morning.
Finally, at 5pm on Sunday, there was an admission that she had pneumonia, which the campaign said had been diagnosed by Dr Bardack.
CLINTON'S DOCTOR Lisa Bardack has been Hillary Clinton's 'long time' personal physician. Exactly how long is unknown, as the candidate has not published her full medical records. Dr Bardack, 52, works for CareMount Medical, a network of 400 physicians in New York State, where the Clinton have their home. A New York University medical graduate, she is the group's chair of internal medicine and usually works at its Mount Kisco campus, close to Chappaqua.
Dr Bardack has been suggested to be to be the woman who was at Clinton's side as she was escorted away from the memorial.
The campaign has not commented on whether she is. DailyMail.com is also trying to contact Dr Bardack.
The dark-haired woman was accompanied by a Secret Service agent who is part of Clinton's regular security detail as she helped Clinton away from the memorial, and towards the van waiting for her.
On the way there, she held Clinton's hand in a gesture which has been suggested to be either taking her pulse, or a test for neurological damage.
The neurological test is one of a series administered to check that the brain is correctly instructing the body and has not suffered damage in some form.
The woman is not one of Clinton's well-known aides often seen at her side, including Huma Abedin, her closest assistant, and is not known to have been seen with Clinton before.
The woman appears to have stood directly behind Clinton and whispered at length in her ear, video footage of the memorial service itself also discloses.
Twitter is alight with rumors that someone is keeping tabs on Clinton's health at all times, and that the candidate may even be suffering neurological damage.
Supporting role: As Clinton collapsed getting into the Secret Service 'Scooby van', the woman was to her left holding her
Escort: The woman was directly beside Clinton as she was led away from the memorial, to the surprise of other people there
'Undercover': This photo appears to show a woman, described as an 'undercover nurse' checking Clinton's pulse prior to her collapse on Sunday, while Clinton clutches her heart
Rumors: Pictures apparently showing Clinton squeezing the woman's fingers also revived much derided rumors that Clinton is suffering from Parkinson's disease
Doctor who? Some Twitter users suggested the mystery woman was Clinton's doctor, Lisa Bardack, although this could not be confirmed.
Clinton collapsed outside her van during Sunday's 9/11 memorial service in New York and was rushed to her daughter's apartment.
Although the collapse was initially written off as 'overheating' by the Clinton camp, Dr Bardack, later confirmed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.
But photographs of Clinton being walked to the SUV appear to show her being tended to by a woman in a blue dress, whom many believe is a nurse.
A Twitter account titled 'Tennessee GOP' posted a picture of Clinton with her right hand on her heart and her left hand and wrist clasped by the woman.
'Undercover nurse checking Hillary's pulse?!' the tweet asked.
And a second picture, posted by Mathijs Koenraadt showed Clinton talking to the woman, apparently holding her fingers.
'#Hillary squeezing her nurse's fingers,' the user wrote. 'Clearly, she's disoriented. Final stages of Parkinson's disease?'
The woman in question was identified by some as Dr Bardack, but she could not be contacted for comment, and does not appear certain to be the woman.
The sentiments in both Tweets were echoed by numerous other users, under the hashtags #HillaryHealth and #ClintonCollapse.
Claims that Clinton has been suffering from Parkinson's disease have long circulated, although they have never been taken seriously outside of conspiracy theory groups.
Similar concerns also emerged about the presidential candidate having suffered brain or neurological damage as a result of her 2012 diagnoses of a blood clot in her brain, which came after she collapsed due to dehydration and suffered concussion.
She had also suffered two previous blood clots, in 1998 and 2009, as well as suffering a fractured elbow in 2009 after suffering a fall.
Clinton also collapsed in January 2005, reportedly due to a GI virus.",6756
672632899921833984,false,Why Have There Been More Mass Shootings Under Obama than the 4 Previous Presidents Combined? https://t.co/jEeBR7TC95 https://t.co/oVKG80TaqE,http://www.thedailysheeple.com/why-have-there-been-more-mass-shootings-under-obama-than-the-four-previous-presidents-combined_122015,True,Why Have There Been More Mass Shootings Under Obama than the Four Previous Presidents Combined?,"We live in a world of short-term memories and long-term memory deficiencies. If the 24-hour news cycle was any indication, Americans appear to be bouncing from one catastrophic mass shooting to the next, with hardly any breathing room. Like this is just a regular occurrence America has learned to endure because… guns. It’s the prevalence of firearms in the hands of the people, the anti-gunners say. Calls to limit, rewrite, redefine, or outright dispose of the 2nd Amendment are rampant.
But no one is looking at the data. If they did, they would realize something is really, really, really wrong here.
No, there haven’t always been so many mass shootings. It hasn’t always been this way. Mass shootings have skyrocketed in this country just in the last seven years under President Obama.
The following was compiled using the database over at Mother Jones on mass shootings in the U.S. from 1982—2015, up to and including the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on October 1st, 2015. It also includes the Wikipedia lists for mass shootings in the United States by year and postal killings in the U.S.
The following analysis considers the FBI’s definition of a mass murder, which is defined as “a number of murders (four or more) occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders”.
When all incidents where four or more people were shot in a single event are broken out by president going back to Reagan (considering the database only stretches back to 1982), there just so happens to have been a startling increase in mass shootings since Obama, the most pro-gun control president America has had in modern history, took office.
Mass Shootings under the Last Five Presidents
Ronald Reagan: 1981-1989 (8 years) 11 mass shootings
Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 5 George H. W. Bush: 1989-1993 (4 years) 12 mass murders
Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 3
Bill Clinton: 1993-2001 (8 years) 23 mass murders
Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 4 George W. Bush: 2001-2009 (8 years) 20 mass murders
Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 5
Barrack H. Obama: 2009-2015 (in 7th year) 162 mass murders
Incidents with 8 or more deaths = 18
(You can download the full list of names, dates, locations, and numbers of deaths per mass shooting by president prepared for this article here.)
Look at the difference between all other presidents and Barack Obama.
What that looks like on a chart:
Notice anything here? We’re talking about a more than six-fold increase from the number of mass shootings in the eight years Bush Jr. was president compared to the last seven years under Obama, and his 2nd term isn’t even up yet!
Not only that, but the number of mass shootings where the shooter killed eight or more people has also increased rather significantly:
What is going on here?
Obviously this isn’t so easily simplified as more guns in the hands of more crazy people, the way the media likes to spin it. We have more gun laws now than ever before. Less types of guns are legally available to the average citizen than ever before. We also have more “gun-free zones,” zones where, just by the way, most of these shootings happen (because mass shooters do not follow laws or care about zones, obviously). So that’s not it.
We have debated whether or not antidepressant medications are playing a role in these events. Even a cursory glance at the SSRI stories school shootings database would suggest there is some substantial evidence behind this theory. We know that many of these mass shooters were either on psychotropic medications at the time of the shooting, or withdrawing from them.
However, Prozac was approved for use in the United States back in 1987. Antidepressant medications have been around and in widespread use in America for decades now. That factor alone cannot entirely explain all these mass shootings recently.
Not to mention that five out of the 12 deadliest mass shootings in American history have happened not just since Barack Obama became president, but just under his first term as president alone. That’s nearly half.
Something else is going on here.
So… what is it?
After the controversial Sandy Hook shooting, Obama passed 23 gun control executive orders. He continually says wants to do more and he’s frustrated with how limited his powers as mere president are. He continually mentions wishing America’s gun control mirrored that of the UK and Australia, two countries that passed strict, sweeping gun bans following what many have called single mass shooting false flag events which happened just weeks apart in March and April 1996.
Speaking of Australia’s gun control laws after the suspicious Charleston shooting, Obama said:
“It was just so shocking the entire country said, ‘Well, we’re going to completely change our gun laws’, and they did. And it hasn’t happened since,” Obama said, discussing the shooting deaths of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston last week.
The suspicious April 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School didn’t accomplish nearly the same gun control implementation here in America, although it did happen under another highly pro-gun control president, Bill Clinton. Perhaps one false flag just isn’t enough in a country that has been built upon a Constitution with a Bill of Rights and a 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. Perhaps it can only be killed death-by-a-thousand-cuts style.
Now Obama says gun control will be his #1 top issue of focus for the last year of his final term as president.
He says his biggest frustration has been his inability to pass more gun control legislation.
He condemns these “routine” events and calls for more gun control each time another one happens. After the recent Planned Parenthood shooting, he said, “we can’t let this become the new normal… enough is enough.”
But when did it become the new normal? While the 2nd Amendment continues to be attacked each and every time another mass shooting occurs, just realize something: these events were never this “routine” until Obama became president.

Police move in after more hostages escape
High-profile attack in Sydney's central business district unprecedented
Streets usually bustling with city workers, tourists and shoppers
Dramatic scenes ended a tense hostage situation early Tuesday in Sydney, with sounds of an explosion and gunfire as Australian police stormed a cafe where a gunman had hours earlier taken more than 10 people hostage.
""The whole moment seemed to begin by the escape by our count of six or seven hostages; they ran out from the right-hand side of the cafe and flew down the steps and into the arms of the waiting police,"" Channel 7 reporter Chris Reason told CNN.
""At that point there were a couple of minutes of silence, a police unit moved in; we could see them in dark uniforms, night-vision goggles on, looking toward the door. There was a shot fired -- we think that at that point that it was the gunman firing a shot. We heard from one police officer saying that a hostage was down and at that point the police moved in,"" Reason said.
""We saw a lot of explosive material -- flash bangs as they're called, stun grenades to try to disrupt and startle the gunman as police units moved in from both sides of the cafe to try to get him before he could do any further damage.""
Live footage from the scene later showed heavily armed police running toward the Lindt Chocolate Cafe before at least four people were carried away on stretchers.
Channel 7 reporter Sean Berry said the scene had been quiet for several hours before police swarmed the area.

""All of a sudden, gunfire, heavily armed police officers -- police en masse -- and those hostages (were) beginning to be brought out,"" he said.
On any ordinary workday, the scene in Sydney would have been packed with people crisscrossing Martin Place on their way to work, home and shops.
But this week before Christmas, the inner-city streets fell silent.
""It is eerily quiet for the center of the city, which is normally humming with traffic and pedestrians. ... People would be normally walking the streets. They've roped off several blocks around Martin Place,"" said CNN's Anna Coren, who was about a block from the scene.
Martin Place is a paved traffic-free zone, a pedestrian-friendly promenade a few blocks from the ferry terminal at Sydney Harbor. It's where people go to meet, have coffee and catch a train.
Heavily armed police
Outside the Lindt shop, heavily armed police, some in camouflage gear and armed with sniper rifles, had taken positions as negotiators attempted to talk to the man inside, since identified as Man Haron Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, a self-styled Muslim cleric.
Passers-by were herded back behind police barriers, while surrounding buildings were evacuated.
Opposite the Lindt shop is the entrance to the Martin Place underground train station, where trains stopped running during the siege.
Beyond the train station are the studios of Australian network Channel 7, whose huge glass windows act as the backdrop for early-morning programming, and where crowds are encouraged to gather.
In the early hours of the standoff, the network, a CNN affiliate, turned its cameras around to film across the street. It captured the images that Channel 7 producer Patrick Byrne described as ""shocking and chilling.""
""People were putting their hands up against the panes of glass at the cafe. This was just extraordinary,"" Byrne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Moments later a black flag bearing white Islamic writing was pressed against the window, drawing gasps from the newsroom, he said.

""We've shut off the monitors that face onto Martin Place for fear that people inside the cafe might be able to see the pictures broadcast,"" Byrne said at the time.
'Surreal' scene
Few live images of the cafe were broadcast amid police warnings not to disclose operational matters.
Macquarie Radio Network reporter Glenn Wheeler described the scene as ""very surreal.""
""There are literally hundreds or thousands of people wandering around with this expression of bewilderment,"" he told 2GB radio station. ""We can't believe this is happening.""
He said hundreds, if not thousands, of people had assembled in nearby Hyde Park after being told to leave the area around Martin Place.
Wheeler recounted a conversation he had with two German tourists who said, ""We thought Sydney was safe.""
It was a sentiment that was apparent in the street and on social media.
While Australia's operating under a ""high"" terror alert, a high-profile attack in Sydney's central business district was unexpected and unprecedented.
Authorities are not explicitly referring to the incident as a ""terror attack,"" but New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert.""
Sydney residents expressed their shock and dismay.
""It's probably the first time in Australian history that something this major in regards to a terrorist threat has happened,"" Joshua Martin told Reuters.
'High' terror alert
The hostage situation follows dozens of police terror raids in the city that have strained relations with the local Muslim community.
Amid reports that as many as 100 Australians had left the country to support ISIS' quest to create a so-called Islamic State, authorities introduced tough new terror laws.
The new regulations give authorities the power to imprison people for ""advocating terrorism."" They also criminalize travel to areas deemed by Australia's foreign minister as ""no-go"" zones, and impose stiff penalties for Australian citizens who leave the country to engage in foreign wars.
In September, Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised the country's terror threat level to ""high"" but said there had been ""no specific intelligence of particular plots.""",6577

He specializes in pediatric neurosurgery. This is an area I’m familiar with because one of my cousins was a pediatric neurologist for many years at the world famous Great Ormond Street hospital in London.
You don’t get to specialize in the medical science of children’s brains unless you’re incredibly skilled at your job.
My cousin’s highly intelligent and has helped save many young lives.
Dr Carson, I must therefore presume, is also highly intelligent and has also helped save many young lives.
When Ben Carson first entered the political arena, I thought he might be a breath of fresh air: a black republican brain surgeon. It’s fair to say you don’t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington. But then he started speaking
So why does he persist in making public statements that make him sound like the most brainless berk in America?
When he first entered the political arena, I thought he might be a breath of fresh air: a black republican brain surgeon.
It’s fair to say you don’t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington.
But then he started speaking.
He compared homosexuals to bestiality and announced that being homosexual was ‘absolutely’ a choice, explaining: ‘A lot of people go into prison straight and when they come out, they’re gay.’
He followed this by saying that Obamacare, a policy established to bring 30 million uninsured poor people into healthcare, was ‘the worst thing to happen to the nation since slavery’, adding: ‘And it is slavery in a way.’
His next pronouncement was that America is now ‘very much like Nazi Germany’ and the Obama administration acts ‘like the Gestapo’.
Yes, he compared this government to one that committed the Holocaust.
More recently, he declared that no Muslim could ever become president, despite the U.S. constitution making it very clear that ‘no religious Test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust in the United States.’
By now I was fairly convinced that Dr Carson was a nasty little bigot.
What I didn’t expect him to be was stupid, or a man lacking in principle even if I didn’t agree with those principles.
But then came the issue of guns.
In 2013, Glenn Beck asked Dr Carson if people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons.
He replied: ‘I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people and the semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person, I would rather you not have it.’
I cheered this sensible view from what seemed to be a very sensible man.
But reaction from the hard-right gun lobby was fast and furious.
Ben Carson really went crazy, telling ABC News that if he’d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he’d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well. Pictured: Gunman Chris Harper-Mercer
Conservative commentator Dana Loesch said ‘a lot’ of people like Dr Carson but ‘his belief of restriction of gun rights is a deal-killer’.
The irony of course being that his call for a restriction of military assault rifles for civilians would actually stop less things being killed.
Since the mass school shooting in Oregon, though, Dr Carson’s had a re-think about guns.
Or more of a cowardly U-turn for pure political expediency.
‘Guns don’t kill people,’ he told Fox & Friends yesterday, with a straight face.
Later, he stopped by The View and said he’d like kindergarten teachers to be armed.
Then, asked by Fox News if he’d go the scene of the Oregon shooting as President Obama is doing, he replied: ‘I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I’d go to the next one.’
Finally, he went really bats**t crazy, telling ABC News that if he’d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he’d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well.
The clear message being that the students who died had somehow failed to show his kind of Rambo strength of character in their moment of horrendous terror.
But victim-blaming wasn’t even Dr Carson’s most hideous statement on guns in the last 48 hours.
In a Facebook posting on Monday night, he said this: ‘As a Doctor, I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies. There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking – but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.’
WHAT?
I’d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children. Each of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls (I repeat this detail a lot, because I want people to know it and visualize it)
One of America’s leading surgeons believes no bullet-ridden body of a fellow American can ever be worse than gun control measures designed to stop the shooting happening in the first place?
I’d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children. Each of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls (I repeat this detail a lot, because I want people to know it and visualize it).
Then I want to hear him tell the parents of those kids that their annihilation wasn’t as devastating as him having to give up guns.
He wouldn’t have the courage to say it to their faces, of course.
In fact, Dr Carson seems a particularly gutless individual generally for one with such an eminent resumé.
A man who loves to bill himself as a charming, respectable, humble, smart brain surgeon. But who in reality is an unpleasant, arrogant, sneering piece of work pandering to the very worst elements of the far-right GOP membership, and prepared to chop and change his views on a whim to secure their support.
My neurologist cousin is a man of great kindness, sensitivity and genuine humility.
The staggering thing about Dr Carson is that he can, by all accounts, show all these qualities in a surgery room.
But when running for president he prefers to be casually vicious, prejudiced and callous.
The most dangerous people in politics are often the most intelligent.
They know best how to manipulate the masses, and to get what they want.
An America run by Dr Carson would be a shameful place.
One where intolerance is king and death is inconsequential.",6469

The gang of ""brazen burglars"" involved in the £14m Hatton Garden jewellery raid are facing jail after the final three were convicted of involvement.
The ""largest burglary in English legal history"" took place at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in London's jewellery quarter over Easter last year.
Four ""ringleaders"" had already pleaded guilty. Two had been involved in the Brinks Mat and Security Express raids.
The gang raided safe deposit boxes for jewels after boring into the vault.
Image copyright Met Police Image caption Carl Wood, William Lincoln and Hugh Doyle were all found guilty of their involvement in the heist
Carl Wood, William Lincoln and Hugh Doyle were connected to the £14m Hatton Garden jewellery raid, a jury at Woolwich Crown Court decided.
Jon Harbinson - Lincoln's nephew - was cleared of playing a part in the heist last Easter weekend. He has been set free after eight months in custody.
Four men - Brian Reader, Kenny Collins, Terry Perkins and Daniel Jones - had admitted conspiracy to commit burglary.
Two other people were convicted earlier in connection with criminal property offences.

During the raid the gang used heavy cutting equipment to get into a vault at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd and ransack 56 safe deposit boxes.
CCTV footage showed some of the gang members arriving in a white van and unloading tools, on 2 April.
However, they were unable to gain access to the vault after discovering it was blocked off by a metal cabinet.
They returned with different equipment two nights later to finish the job.

Comic strip: How the raid was carried out
Once inside, they used the lift shaft to access the basement, disabled the alarm and bored through the vault wall.
They were eventually seen emerging from the building with holdalls and wheelie bins laden with stolen goods.
Gold, diamonds and sapphires, together worth up to £14m, were taken. Two thirds of the valuables remain unrecovered.
Det Supt Craig Turner from the Metropolitan Police said: ""The weight of evidence was so strong that half the gang chose to plead guilty.
""It was an audacious, brazen burglary that was some three years in the planning.""
Image copyright Met Police Image caption ""Ringleaders"" - Brian Reader, Kenny Collins, Terry Perkins, Daniel Jones - old-fashioned crime methods led police to their doorsteps, the court heard
Another man, known only as ""Basil"", who let his co-conspirators into the Hatton Garden building by opening the fire escape from inside is yet to be identified.
The police are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.
Reviewing lawyer Ed Hall from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""The four main ringleaders, a close-knit group of experienced criminals, some of whom had been involved in other high-value crimes, pleaded guilty after realising the strength of the case against them.
""As a result of this trial, three other men who played significant roles, including the moving and concealing the stolen gold and jewels, have also been convicted.""
Defendants and verdicts
Carl Wood, 58, of Elderbeck Close, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire: Guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property
William Lincoln, 60, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green: Guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property
Hugh Doyle, 48, of Riverside Gardens, Enfield: Guilty of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property
Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield; John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield, and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, have all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
Jon Harbinson, 42, of Beresford Gardens, Benfleet, Essex: Found not guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property
The court heard the conspirators would meet to make plans at The Castle pub on Pentonville Road in Islington, and Scotti's, a nearby cafe.
During the trial it was revealed that Reader had been involved in the £26m Brinks Mat gold bullion robbery, and Perkins in the £6m Security Express raid which both took place in 1983.
They were arrested after police bugged their cars and heard them bragging.
Perkins was heard saying: ""I'm going to melt my good gold down. The Indian, the 18, that could be my pension.""
Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption Rings worth up to £15,000 each, and other jewels were found by police following the burglary, the court heard.
During the case, prosecutor Philip Evans told the jury: ""These four ringleaders and organisers of this conspiracy, although senior in years, brought with them a great deal of experience in planning and executing sophisticated and serious acquisitive crime not dissimilar to this.
""This offence was to be the largest burglary in English legal history.""
There was no forensic trace left at the vault by the gang, but police found a number of stolen goods during house searches as well as a copy of Forensics For Dummies at Jones's house and a book on the diamond underworld at Reader's home.
All seven are expected to be sentenced on 7 March.
Special reports into the Hatton Garden raid
It can now be reported that Perkins' daughter, Terri Robinson, 35, of Sterling Road, Enfield, also faces being jailed. She pleaded guilty to concealing, converting or transferring criminal property.
Her brother-in-law, Brenn Walters, 43, who is also known as Ben Perkins, admitted the same offence.
The Met Police had faced criticism over its handling of the case after it emerged it had not followed procedures after receiving a call from a security firm about an intruder alert at the premises at midnight on Good Friday.
Following the verdict, Det Supt Turner said: ""We apologise for not actually attending the alarm. It is quite clear that police should have attended. We have reviewed all our systems and processes.""

692929779696275456,non-rumor,Ohio lawmakers want to know why state’s EPA didn’t tell public about lead leaking into water supply of Sebring.  https://t.co/aJyfZKX0az,http://cnn.it/1KeeR4c,True,Sebring lead levels: Lawmakers question Ohio EPA's actions,"(CNN) The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency knew in August that there was lead leakage into the water system of Sebring, Ohio, state lawmakers said Thursday.
State Rep. John Boccieri and state Sen. Joe Schiavoni, both Democrats, called on the director of the Ohio EPA to publicly answer questions regarding recent evidence of lead exposure in the northeast Ohio village.
""We have received no answer to our repeated questions about steps taken by the EPA, which shares a moral and legal obligation to notify the public when such a crisis evolves, to remedy this crisis."" Boccieri wrote in a letter to Ohio Speaker of the House Cliff Rosenberger, a Republican.
Sebring is the latest place to find troubling amounts of lead in city water. The problem caused school closures to allow for further testing.
In a statement to CNN, the Ohio EPA said it believes ""a maximum of six homes"" were affected by lead exposure, based on the department's testing.
A water advisory alert for pregnant women and children was posted on the Ohio EPA website on December 3.
But Boccieri and Schiavoni said the Ohio EPA had knowledge of the lead leakage as early as August, citing reports from Ream & Haager Laboratory, a state-certified vendor that conducted the water tests.
Ream & Haager confirmed to the state legislators and, separately, to CNN that the lab's test results were sent to the Ohio EPA on August 21.
Results were sent back to the Sebring water treatment plant, as well, according to the laboratory.
The timeline of a crisis
The Ohio EPA received incomplete data from the treatment plant in the fall of 2015, which slowed the response to consumers, said Heidi Griesmer, deputy director of communications for the agency.
A September email from an Ohio EPA environmental specialist to Jim Bates, the operator of Sebring's water treatment plant, expresses concern about the samples used by the treatment plant in its lead and copper tests, according to documents obtained by CNN.
Ohio EPA Director Craig Butler said Sebring played a ""cat-and-mouse game"" with the agency during this time. He said in a statement on Sunday that his team was ""too patient"" in dealing with village officials.
Concerns about the town's water samples continued into the fall.
In November, further documents show, the Ohio EPA asked the water system to provide missing documents from the treatment plant's monitoring period between June 1 and September 30.
On December 3, the Ohio EPA sent a letter to Rick Giroux, Sebring's village manager, stating that not only had lead measurements ""exceeded the lead action level,"" but also that the town should have delivered ""public education materials"" about the heightened lead levels by November 29.
The plant has a federally regulated responsibility to notify customers within 30 days of receiving results that show lead levels in excess of the allowable level, according to the Ohio EPA.
The next month, the Ohio EPA continued to talk with village government and the treatment plant regarding further corrosion studies. In mid-January the agency enforced violations against the city for its slow notification of the public. By January 25, schools were closed for further Ohio EPA testing.
The results of that recent testing, released on Tuesday by the Ohio EPA, showed that two water fountains in Sebring schools indicated samples above the federal allowable level for lead. Testing of an additional 28 homes last weekend showed three instances of elevated lead in the water. The Sebring water treatment plant tested 20 homes in the fall.
The homes were chosen in accordance with federal guidelines that ""direct public water systems to sample homes that are known to have lead plumbing or lead service lines,"" said Griesmer, the Ohio EPA spokeswoman.
""Through our investigation, we are still determining if they tested the correct homes and followed federal protocol in selecting those locations,"" Griesmer said.
On Tuesday, the Ohio EPA said in a press release that it issued emergency orders prohibiting Bates, the Sebring treatment plant operator, from operating that plant or any other plant, and also proposing the revocation of his license. The agency also said it had opened an investigation ""as it has reason to suspect the operator falsified reports,"" a measure it had indicated it was pursuing in a press release two days earlier.
The Sebring Water Treatment plant deferred to Giroux, the village manager, to speak on their behalf, but calls for comment have not yet been returned.
Efforts to reach Bates directly were not immediately successful.
What did the Ohio EPA know?
Boccieri and Schiavoni have written multiple letters to Butler, the Ohio EPA director, demanding information. The state representatives question the lack of aggressiveness by the Ohio EPA in its dealings with the city, and want to know why the EPA did not take immediate action after the August 2015 testing results.
""To date, we have received no answer to repeated questions about steps taken by the EPA, which shares a moral and legal obligation to notify the public when such a crisis evolves,"" Boccieri wrote in his letter Thursday.
The agency says it is doing all it can to ensure the best for both the town's residents and the state, including a $25,000 grant to the town for filtration systems.
""We are in the process of developing new protocols and appropriate personnel actions to ensure that our field staff takes action when it appears that a water system is not complying and taking their review seriously,"" Butler said in Sunday's statement.
The Ohio EPA provided CNN with a letter from the regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, dated January 2, showing support for the Ohio EPA's actions and offering no other recommendations.
Rep. Boccieri, in his letter, called on the Ohio House of Representatives to subpoena Butler to testify in front of state legislators to further explain the situation.
""My mission right now is twofold,"" Boccieri wrote. ""I want to make sure that the community has safe drinking water while under this EPA advisory, and that the children who are affected get the best possible care. Second, I want to ensure that we amend the process in which the state responds to such health crises so that this does not happen to another community across the state.""",6352

2015 Data Release

https://t.co/HMYlgtcN1Y

With Love,

Anonymous

. https://t.co/uTIMGvOeeo",http://pastebin.com/wbvP95wg,True,Official OpKKK HoodsOff 2015 Data Release,"Where to Start? The basics. The Ku Klux Klan has approximately 150 active cells, operating in 41 states, with membership concentrated in both the South and the Midwest. The KKK is not what it once was but it does continue to survive in various locations throughout the United States. At its peak, membership was in the millions. Now, membership is likely less than 5,000. It is very important to understand - the KKK does not have a central unified leadership. Instead, they are split off into local cells or groups.
These groups generally oppose interracial relationships, homosexuality and illegal immigration and historically express this ideology through acts of terror. We want to remind you: This operation is not about the ideas of members of the Ku Klux Klan. This is about the behaviors of members of KKK splinter cells that bear the hallmarks of terrorism. When members of the KKK like Frazier Glenn Miller, (founder of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party) murdered three innocent individuals at a Jewish retirement home during Passover - the word ""terrorism"" was seldom found in mainstream media's coverage of the attack. Why? What sort of violence does it take to call *some* factions of Ku Klux Klan what *some* of these cells really are? 
We defend free thought and free speech. The anons responsible for this operation will not support *acts* of terrorism and *acts* of hate inflicted upon the public. The KKK is part of an important cultural landscape and history in the United States.
We need to make room for important, blunt, honest, public, productive conversation. Violent bigotry IS a problem in the United States. This is not a colorblind society. It deeply divided on racial lines.
We hope Operation KKK will, in part, spark a bit of constructive dialogue about race, racism, racial terror and freedom of expression, across group lines. Public discourse about these topics can be honest, messy, snarky, offensive, humbling, infuriating, productive, and serious all at once. The reality is that racism usually does NOT wear a hood but it does permeate our culture on every level. Part of the reason we have taken the hoods off of these individuals is not because of their identities, but because of what their hoods symbolize to us in our broader society.
In media, the Ku Klux Klan is an easy target to pick on. In terms of the KKK, journalists usually print what they want with very little consequence because sensational stories like this generate impressive ad revenue (just like with the bogus OpKKK leak).
We feel it is important to provide accurate information about our observations during this operation. We learned, that aside from our striking differences in overall ideology and behavior, we have found that many members of Ku Klux Klan groups actually have a few important similarities to us. For example, they are mostly poor and pissed off at the the Man. They oppose government surveillance and they generally feel persecuted for free thought. Day to day, some klan members work very hard for very little. This is a common ground we understand all to well. We feel that the ability to find common struggles with those that are very different than ourselves is important. Even if they are filled with hatred. We will never sympathize with the KKK but we do desire to understand them and learn about how they see their world. We do see their humanity, we respect their right to free thought and we know their fear of others is wrong. We also know their behaviors strike fear, anxiety and terror into others. This will no longer be socially tolerated.
In this dox list, you will find official members of various KKK groups throughout the United States as well as their closest associates (most are also in other extremist hate groups). You will see many names with ALIAS beside it. If indicated, these are CONFIRMED aliases. Other names on this list may be aliases, as well. Some aliases we were unable to crack. The klan sometimes hides behind several online identities. Given name or alias, these are the real people underneath the hoods.
It is important to note that many klan members change klan affiliations as well as go back and forth between being klan members and neo nazis etc (sometimes both, if permitted). There is quite a bit of movement between these types of groups (usually due to infighting). For this reason, you will see some names of individuals that are listed as neo nazis and so on. Some members of this list are quite dangerous, sociopathic individuals. Others are not.
Data collected for Operation KKK was gathered over approximately 11 months and those included on this list were identified primarily through HUMINT (human intelligence) data collection strategies. This means that individuals on this list were often identified by human sources of information through both overt (interviewing expert sources) and covert (digital espionage / social engineering) methods. Individuals on our list were also identified through open source intelligence strategies (OSINT). This is a broad array of information and sources that are generally available to the public. This includes: multimedia, academic records and public data. Members often told on themselves to us about their connections with the KKK during various chat conversations we had with klan members and affiliates throughout the course of our operation. You never know who you are talking to on the internet. 
We understand this initiative is extremely controversial and we know we will face much criticism for this operation and our work will be heavily scrutinized. We hope this body of work speaks for itself. This is the OFFICIAL Operation KKK 2015 intel report associated with the @Operation_KKK Twitter account. The anons at @Operation_KKK are responsible for this specific liberation of information and we have done our best to ensure accuracy and avoid collateral damage to innocent parties. Erring on the side of caution, we removed several names from this list for further evaluation.
We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.

Cecil Parkinson has died aged 84 after what his family said was ""a long battle with cancer"".
As Conservative Party chairman under Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, he played a key role in the Tories' 1983 general election victory.
Lord Parkinson quit the cabinet soon after when it emerged his ex-secretary Sara Keays was carrying his child.
Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""a man of huge ability"" who had helped transform the UK in the 1980s.
Paying tribute in Downing Street, Mr Cameron said he had ""learnt a lot"" from Lord Parkinson at the start of his political career, describing him as part of ""a great political generation that really did extraordinary things for our country"".
And Mark Thatcher said Lord Parkinson had been a ""great personal friend"" to his family.
As they confirmed his death, a family spokesman said: ""We shall miss him enormously. As a family, we should like to pay tribute to him as a beloved husband to Ann and brother to Norma, and a supportive and loving father to Mary, Emma and Joanna and grandfather to their children.
""We also salute his extraordinary commitment to British public life as a member of parliament, cabinet minister and peer - together with a distinguished career in business.""

Image copyright PA Image caption Cecil Parkinson briefly returned to frontline politics in 1997, reprising his role as Conservative chairman
The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said Cecil Parkinson was one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies but said that his career was ""undone"" by the scandal that engulfed him following his affair with Ms Keays.
The former chartered accountant and businessman was central to Margaret Thatcher's political agenda and achievements in office, he added.
'Charm'
Lord Parkinson was in the front rank of Conservative politics for three decades, first being elected to Parliament in 1970.
After becoming a junior minister after Margaret Thatcher's 1979 election victory, he swiftly rose through the ranks and was named party chairman and elevated to the cabinet in 1981. He was a member of the war cabinet during the 1982 Falklands conflict.
He was tipped to be named foreign secretary after overseeing the Tories' landslide election victory in 1983. But he was given the more junior role of trade and industry secretary and it later emerged he had fathered a child with his former secretary, prompting him to resign in October 1983.
Former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo said this scandal had ""definitely held back his career"" but the fact that he was offered a cabinet post at all was testament to his closeness to the PM.

Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said Lord Parkinson would have been ""the most natural candidate"" to succeed Margaret Thatcher had events not turned out in the way they did.
""John Major eventually filled the gap that Cecil Parkinson would have had,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""But Cecil Parkinson was in reality a Thatcherite while John Major, as Margaret Thatcher eventually discovered, was not nearly as close to her, as she had hoped and assumed"".
The former prime minister regarded Cecil Parkinson as ""one of us"", Sir Malcolm added: ""He shared her views, thoughts and ideas. She was comfortable with him and had confidence in him, In addition, at a personal level, he was able to charm her.""
'Exceptional talent'
After being brought back into government by Margaret Thatcher in 1987, Cecil Parkinson served as energy and transport secretaries.
He stood down as an MP in 1992 and was elevated to the House of Lords. He briefly made a comeback as Tory Party chairman, under William Hague, after the party's general election hammering in 1997.

Lord Hague described him as ""an exceptional talent and an extraordinarily nice man to work with"".
Other members of the current government have also been paying tribute. Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: ""Sad to hear of death of Cecil Parkinson. I worked with him when he was party chairman in 1997-8 - he was there in our hour of greatest need.""
And former minister Alan Duncan said Lord Parkinson was ""personable, amusing, easy-going and mischievously witty"". ""He started as Margaret Thatcher's great marketing man for overseas trade and turned into one of the great personalities of the Thatcher era,"" he said.
When the scandal over Cecil Parkinson's infidelity broke during the 1983 Conservative Party conference, Ms Keays claimed the politician had agreed to leave his wife Ann for her.
In her book, A Question Of Judgement, Ms Keays claimed that the then Mr Parkinson had ""begged"" her to have an abortion and that he had ""haggled over every pound"" of financial support for their daughter Flora.
But the Conservative politician insisted that he had voluntarily made more than adequate provision for Flora - who was diagnosed at an early age with learning disabilities and Asperger's syndrome, and had an operation to remove a brain tumour when she was four.
In 1993, Cecil Parkinson and Sara Keays secured an injunction to prevent any information being published about Flora or her schooling until she turned 18. The court order was designed to protect her privacy but was later disowned by Miss Keays.
In an interview in 2002, after the gagging order had expired, Flora Keays said her father had ""behaved very badly"" towards her and her mother but hoped that one day he would become ""part of our lives"".",6127

The US has imposed fresh sanctions on Iranian companies and individuals over a recent ballistic missile test.
The new sanctions prevent 11 entities and individuals linked to the missile programme from using the US banking system.
The move came after international nuclear sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of a deal hailed by President Barack Obama on Sunday as ""smart"".
Four American-Iranians were also freed in a prisoner swap as part of the deal.
Among them was Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian - whom President Obama described as ""courageous"". A fifth American was freed separately.
Iran nuclear deal: Key details
Iran is back in business for now
Iran's press ecstatic as sanctions end
What lifting Iran sanctions means for world markets
Released prisoners leave Iran
Rezaian and two of the others freed flew to a US base in Germany via Geneva for medical evaluation.
Another, Nosratollah ­Khosravi-Roodsari, did not fly out with the others, US officials said. A fifth man, Matthew Trevithick, was freed in a separate process.
The US said it had offered clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violations.
Negotiations in December over the prisoner exchange delayed the US Treasury's imposition of the latest sanctions.
They were only announced once the plane containing the former prisoners had left Iran, reports said.
Image copyright Brett McGurk Image caption US official Brett McGurk said he was thrilled to meet Razaian at Geneva airport after ""18 months of unjust imprisonment""
'Significant threat'
They were triggered by Iran conducting a precision-guided ballistic missile test capable of delivering a nuclear warhead last October, violating a United Nations ban.
""Iran's ballistic missile programme poses a significant threat to regional and global security, and it will continue to be subject to international sanctions,"" said Adam J Szubin, US acting under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
Moments later, President Obama hailed the nuclear deal, which is being implemented following verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran had restricted its sensitive nuclear activities.

And he defended a separate settlement at an international legal tribunal which will see the US repay Iran $400m (£280m) in funds frozen since 1981 plus a further $1.3bn in interest - saying there was no point ""dragging this out"".
Earlier, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the nuclear deal opened a ""new chapter"" in the country's relations with the world.
The deal has been welcomed by many governments, the UN and EU - but disparaged by some US Republicans and Israel, which says it allows Iran to continue to ""spread terror"".
What are the sanctions?
Nuclear sanctions have been in place since 2006, on top of other sanctions stretching back decades:
The economic sanctions being lifted now were imposed progressively by the US, EU and UN in response to Iran's nuclear programme
The EU is lifting restrictions on trade, shipping and insurance in full
The US is suspending, not terminating, its nuclear-related sanctions; crucially, Iran can now reconnect to the global banking system
The UN is lifting sanctions related to defence and nuclear technology sales, as well as an asset freeze on key individuals and companies
Non-nuclear US economic sanctions remain in place, notably the ban on US citizens and companies trading with Iran, and US and EU sanctions on Iranians accused of sponsoring terrorism remain in place
A flurry of Iranian economic activity is anticipated:
Nearly $100bn (£70bn) of Iranian assets are being unlocked
Iran is expected to increase its daily export of 1.1m barrels of crude oil by 500,000 shortly, and a further 500,000 thereafter
Iran is reportedly poised to buy 114 new passenger planes from the Airbus consortium
What it means for Iran's economy and world markets
The prospect of Iran doubling its crude oil exports has contributed to the continuing fall in the oil price. Benchmark Brent crude closed below $29 (£20.3) on Friday.
Share prices in Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's largest stock market, fell more than 6% following the lifting of sanctions.
The IAEA said it had installed a device at the Natanz plant to monitor Iran's uranium enrichment activities in real time, in order to verify that uranium enrichment levels were kept at up to 3.67% as agreed in the deal with world powers.
As part of the deal, Iran had to drastically reduce its number of centrifuges and dismantle a heavy-water reactor near the town of Arak, both of which could be used in creating nuclear weapons.

At least 71 people have died in blasts near the Shia shrine of Sayyida Zeinab, south of Syria's capital Damascus.
A bus station and a building housing military headquarters were hit by the blasts, which mangled nearby vehicles.
It happened as the government and opposition groups gathered in Geneva in a bid to start talks aimed at a political solution to the conflict.
The attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, was aimed at disrupting the talks, the EU said.
Both the Syrian government and opposition are in Geneva but the talks have yet to begin. The main opposition group says the government must first meet key humanitarian demands.
US Secretary of State John Kerry urged both sides to seize the opportunity to end the bloodshed.
Mr Kerry said there was ""no military solution"" to the spiralling crisis, which he warned could engulf the region if the tentative UN-sponsored negotiations fail as previous attempts have.
The UN envoy to Syria has scheduled separate discussions with both sides in Geneva on Monday.
What hope for the talks?
International system has failed Syria
The story of the conflict
Image copyright AFP Image caption Correspondents say the destruction is ""huge""
Image copyright AFP Image caption A bus and building housing a military headquarters were hit by the blasts
Image caption BBC journalists at the scene said the air was thick with a sickly smell - a combination of high explosives, blood and burnt fruit
Sunday's attacks near Sayyida Zeinab were carried out by two suicide bombers, but some witnesses spoke of three blasts.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that, of the 71 people killed, 42 were fighters loyal to the Assad regime. The group said another 29 civilians, including five children, died.
The blasts took place several hundred metres from the golden-domed shrine, which was not itself damaged - although it has been previously targeted, most recently in February last year.
It contains the grave of one of the Prophet Muhammad's grand-daughters and continues to draw many Shia pilgrims, despite the civil war.
At the scene: Rami Ruhayem, BBC Arabic, south-eastern Damascus
The destruction is huge. The building in front of me on Koua Soudan Street is charred black in the middle. I'm told that there is a military headquarters on the ground floor and families also lived in the five-storey building.
There is a fruit stall with blackened oranges all over the floor.
I can also see a large number of charred vehicles, including a bus in the middle of the street which is almost completely destroyed and overturned. The smoke is still rising from one of the cars on the side of the street.
BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says Shia fighters from around the region have joined the conflict in Syria on the grounds that they wish to protect the shrine from the civil war.
The Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah has cited it as a key reason that it chose to fight on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, he adds.
More than 250,000 people have died and 11 million have fled their homes in almost five years of civil war in Syria. The violence has also been the biggest driver behind Europe's migration crisis.
Geneva peace talks
Who is attending? Delegates from the Syrian government and the main opposition bloc, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC). Other opposition figures have been invited as advisers.
Who is not attending? Syrian Kurdish group the PYD (regarded by Turkey as a terrorist group); so-called Islamic State (IS); al-Nusra Front.
What is being discussed? A possible ceasefire; release of prisoners; aid deliveries to the worst-hit areas; the threat from IS.
The bombings were ""clearly aimed to disrupt the attempts to start a political process"" in Geneva, said EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.
The initiative got off to a shaky start after the opposition High Negotiations Committee (HNC), backed by Saudi Arabia, only agreed late on Friday that it would travel to Geneva - hours after the Syrian government delegation had arrived and held preliminary talks with UN envoy Staffan de Mistura.
The HNC had been under considerable pressure from Saudi Arabia and the US to attend.
Hostility between key players remains high, with the Syrian government's envoy Bashar al-Jaafari saying the HNC's last-minute decision to take part showed it was ""not serious"".
He said the Sayyida Zeinab attack confirmed the link between the opposition and terrorism.
Nevertheless, he was also quoted as saying the government was ""absolutely"" considering humanitarian moves such as the creation of humanitarian corridors, ceasefires and prisoner releases.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The head of the Syrian government delegation, Bashar al-Jaafari, said the opposition was ""not serious""
Image copyright AFP Image caption HNC spokesman Salim Muslet says government attacks on civilians must stop
The urgent need for humanitarian steps in Syria has been highlighted by the plight of starving residents of the besieged town of Madaya, and the HNC has made them a condition of negotiations.
Mr Kerry had blunt words about the regime's tactics, saying they ran directly counter to the rules of war by forcing residents to choose between surrendering or starving in towns such as Madaya.
Mr Mistura described the talks as ""a good start"" and told the BBC he was ""optimistic"". He said the HNC would give more details later.
The so-called proximity talks are expected to last six months, with delegations sitting in separate rooms and UN officials shuttling between them.
UN chief Ban Ki-moon called on all sides to put the interests of Syrians above their own.
""Children and women in particular have borne the brunt of this fighting and it is time now to see the end of the fighting and other human rights abuses that have dominated the war,"" he said.",6042
728013148788154368,unverified,Report: Caitlyn Jenner will pose nude for Sports Illustrated https://t.co/npOWQdrQHo https://t.co/ZmC64PUot8,http://bit.ly/26V2WQW,True,Report: Caitlyn Jenner will pose nude for Sports Illustrated,"- Caitlyn Jenner will reportedly pose nude on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
According to a US Weekly source, the 66-year-old will be featured on the cover of SI wearing only an American flag and her gold medal.
Jenner became ""the world’s greatest athlete"" after winning gold at Montreal Summer Olympics in 1976.
Jenner’s spokesperson told The Huffington Post that there was ""no comment on any future plans at this time.""
Since coming out a year ago, Caitlyn Jenner has not always been a unifying force in the transgender community. Her latest political remarks — underscoring her conservative outlook and praising Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz — ignited a storm of criticism from supporters of transgender rights, who view most conservative Republicans as adversaries.
""Breathtakingly clueless"" was the rebuke from blogger Monica Roberts. Tennis great Martina Navratilova and country singer Chely Wright were also among the many people denouncing Jenner.
Yet a more nuanced conversation followed, questioning whether transgender Americans must be monolithic in broadly espousing progressive politics, or whether they can make room for differing views in their ranks.
Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said she is grateful there are transgender Republicans and would like to see the issue of transgender rights addressed on a nonpartisan basis. She also said it is inevitable that the ranks of transgender Americans would grow more diverse.
""Trans people need to buckle up,"" she said. ""With all the folks who will be coming out in the next few years, you're not going to agree with all of them.""
While Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have voiced strong support for LGBT rights, Cruz and the other Republican contenders have expressed misgivings about same-sex marriage and supported protections for people who oppose it on religious grounds.
Among those wrestling with the fallout of Jenner's remarks is Jennifer Finney Boylan, a writer and professor at Barnard College. She is a consultant and cast member on Jenner's reality show, ""I am Cait.""
In one episode, Boylan — who has described Cruz as a bigot — became so aggravated with Jenner's political views that she swatted her with a rolled-up newspaper.
""In terms of equality and dignity, the difference between Republicans and Democrats is night and day,"" Boylan said in an interview. ""I don't really get why you'd vote against your own civil rights.""
Yet Boylan remains engaged in the TV series and considers Jenner a friend.
""How is it possible to communicate with people whom we want to smack with a newspaper?"" Boylan asked in recent blog post. ""The question, for me, is not, will Cait become a liberal? There is no operation for that, alas. But she CAN become someone who listens, who opens her heart, who has compassion. And so can I.""
Jenner sparked the furor with comments in a March 2 article in The Advocate, an LGBT-oriented magazine.
""I like Ted Cruz,"" Jenner declared, even while describing the Texas senator as ""one of the worst ones"" in regard to transgender rights.
""The Democrats are better when it comes to these types of social issues. I understand that,"" Jenner told The Advocate. ""So why support Republicans? Number 1, if we don't have a country, we don't have trans issues. We need jobs. We need a vibrant economy.""
Jenner suggested lightheartedly that if Cruz is elected president, she could become his ""trans ambassador"" and seek to sway him on transgender issues.
Jay Michaelson, a rabbi, author and gay activist, urged Jenner to backtrack.
""I'm begging you to do so,"" he wrote in The Daily Beast. ""The Republicans' promised actions — especially those of Ted Cruz — would be absolutely devastating to us, and even to you personally.""
Transgender activist Dana Beyer, executive director of Gender Rights Maryland, said it should not be surprising that the former Olympic decathlon champion retained long-held political views.
""We're probably better off if she remains a Republican,"" Beyer said. ""The Republicans for the most part won't talk to us, and we're not going to make progress unless we persuade some of them. We need access.""
Dru Levasseur, Transgender Rights Project director of the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal, said it would be useful if transgender-specific issues were raised in the GOP debates. He said he'd like to learn where the Republicans stand in the heated debate over transgender people's access to public restrooms.
According to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which supports LGBT political candidates, there are no transgender Republicans currently serving in elective office in the U.S.
U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, has a transgender son, and has cited that as a reason why she's more supportive of LGBT rights than most of her GOP colleagues in Congress.
In 2010, a transgender woman, Donna Milo, unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for a congressional seat in Florida.
Being transgender ""doesn't define my values, my goals, my political ambitions, my conservative positions,"" she told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper during the campaign. ""Just because you are somewhat socially open-minded doesn't mean that you're not fiscally conservative, a strong Christian, and believe in a strong foreign policy.""
In St. Paul, Minnesota, Susan Kimberly pursued a long, bipartisan political career after going public with a decision to transition from man to woman in 1984. She served as deputy mayor under Republican Mayor Norm Coleman.
Kimberly, 73 and retired, says she became a Republican while serving with Coleman and remains one today. She's not enamored of Republican positions on LGBT rights, but believes the GOP best represents some of her core values — including self-responsibility and limited government.
""It's really hard to be a Republican, but it remains impossible for me to be a Democrat,"" she said.",5959
692071267189395457,non-rumor,Here's why @POTUS is taking steps to ban solitary confinement for low-level infractions: https://t.co/0G7tIBnIPH https://t.co/aCWEjgQPDA,http://wpo.st/PKP61,True,Barack Obama: Why we must rethink solitary confinement,"Barack Obama is president of the United States.
In 2010, a 16-year-old named Kalief Browder from the Bronx was accused of stealing a backpack. He was sent to Rikers Island to await trial, where he reportedly endured unspeakable violence at the hands of inmates and guards — and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement.
In 2013, Kalief was released, having never stood trial. He completed a successful semester at Bronx Community College. But life was a constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day. One Saturday, he committed suicide at home. He was just 22 years old.
Solitary confinement gained popularity in the United States in the early 1800s, and the rationale for its use has varied over time. Today, it’s increasingly overused on people such as Kalief, with heartbreaking results — which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem.
There are as many as 100,000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons — including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25,000 inmates are serving months, even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell, with almost no human contact.
In a speech to members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in July 2015 where he called for criminal justice reform, President Obama said that solitary confinement ""is not going to make us safer."" (YouTube/The White House)
Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.
The United States is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. Those who do make it out often have trouble holding down jobs, reuniting with family and becoming productive members of society. Imagine having served your time and then being unable to hand change over to a customer or look your wife in the eye or hug your children.
As president, my most important job is to keep the American people safe. And since I took office, overall crime rates have decreased by more than 15 percent. In our criminal justice system, the punishment should fit the crime — and those who have served their time should leave prison ready to become productive members of society. How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesn’t make us safer. It’s an affront to our common humanity.
That’s why last summer, I directed Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the Justice Department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across U.S. prisons. They found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool, such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates. In those cases, the practice should be limited, applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort. They have identified common-sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system.
The Justice Department has completed its review, and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions, expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10,000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement — and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.
[More coverage: Obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons]
States that have led the way are already seeing positive results. Colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement, and assaults against staff are the lowest they’ve been since 2006. New Mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement, with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs. And since 2012, federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff.
Reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform. Every year, we spend $80 billion to keep 2.2 million people incarcerated. Many criminals belong behind bars. But too many others, especially nonviolent drug offenders, are serving unnecessarily long sentences. That’s why members of Congress in both parties are pushing for change, from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities. And I hope they will send me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter, fairer, less expensive and more effective.
In America, we believe in redemption. We believe, in the words of Pope Francis, that “every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.” We believe that when people make mistakes, they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives. And if we can give them the hope of a better future, and a way to get back on their feet, then we will leave our children with a country that is safer, stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.",5921
765359928361922560,non-rumor,"""People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence."" https://t.co/nTkmvf9Ghn",http://bit.ly/2b984uA,True,"Sean Hannity: Apologize to Those with Epilepsy, or Burn in Hell","For more than two decades, the lunatic fringe has gradually taken control of the Republican Party, thanks to craven media figures like Fox News’s Sean Hannity.
A man who purports to be a dutiful Catholic, Hannity has made a career out of violating the ninth commandment (or eighth in his faith) against lying about others. If Hannity stopped vomiting up falsehoods, his program would be nothing but a test pattern. From him and the others in the “Who cares if it’s false?” conservative media camp, we have heard over the decades that Hillary and Bill Clinton murdered many people, that the Bush administration found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Obama could be on the verge of declaring martial law, and on and on.
They are pretend journalists pumping out propaganda to scared, foolish people.
But now, Hannity and his ilk have gone too far with their recent lies about Hillary Clinton’s health, a conspiracy theory conservative media groups have seized upon with no regard for truth. They have used misrepresented photos, theories from quacks and other nonsense to back up their story line.
And then came a video of Clinton making goofy movements with her head when a reporter held a tape recorder very close to her face. Being pulled in different directions by multiple speakers at once, Clinton playfully acted like a bobblehead doll, smiling and then speaking after the joke was over.
Hannity and his lying pals shrieked: Clinton had a seizure! Right in front of the cameras! “Are there many seizures like that?” Hannity said. “This looks like violent, out of control movements on her part.”
I know this response to Sean Hannity is a little raw, but as someone with epilepsy, I hope my editors will let this slip through: Fuck you, Sean. Your willingness to deceive your viewers—to degrade those of us with epilepsy, to suggest something is a seizure when it looks nothing like one, to leave people dumber about this condition—is unforgivable.
Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now
What kind of seizure do you think it was, Sean? Jacksonian? Tonic-clonic? Atonic? Complex-partial? You have no idea, do you Sean? You don’t even know what any of that means. You just spat it out, and in the process made the lives of tens of millions of people who deal with this condition on a daily basis just a little more dangerous and a little more unpleasant.
Despite having taken anticonvulsants for almost four decades, I–like many, many others–have seizures that are not fully controlled. (Those are called refractory seizures, if you care, Sean.) I have woken up, battered and bruised, when people who thought they were helping did things to me they had learned from the movies or television, things that were totally wrong. I lost a job and was tossed out of college because people were terrified of my seizures. (I only was able to complete my education thanks to the government you hate so much Sean, because the school broke the law when it booted me.)
Some Catholics still view epilepsy as religious punishment, which is why for centuries those with seizures have not been allowed to become priests. Is Sean Hannity now saying we should be blocked from holding public office as well?
Many people have heard that Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court has experienced seizures. Unfortunately, Roberts doesn’t talk about it, robbing the many, many children who suffer with this condition of a possible role model, someone who could show them that they can accomplish anything, even if they have epilepsy. And perhaps he won’t talk about it because of people like Hannity who are sending the clear message that people with seizures are somehow the other, something to fear.
What makes it worse, other than Hannity’s willingness to convey the message to millions of children that their place in society should be limited because of their seizures, is that he has painted a false image of what seizures look like and what to do about them. People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There’s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Instead there is a period of at least 5 minutes (and often much longer) when the person is unable to think clearly, is very confused, can have trouble speaking and other problems.
Worse yet, will epilepsy now become the next area of relentless condemnation for Hannity’s gullible Fox News viewers who believe they have found a new political talking point? Will people with epilepsy be more reluctant to be open about revealing their condition because of Hannity’s deceitful, ignorant attack?
The answer, Sean, is yes. While I know you almost never apologize for anything you do on the air, this sin requires some penance. It can be done in secret if you don’t have the character to make a public pronouncement of regret. Write a check. Make a donation to help those you demeaned and damaged.

Google has agreed to pay £130m in back taxes after an ""open audit"" of its accounts by the UK tax authorities.
The payment covers money owed since 2005 and follows a six year inquiry by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.
Google is one of several multinational companies to be have been accused of avoiding tax, in spite of making billions of pounds of sales in Britain.
Senior figures at the US search giant said it would follow new rules which would see it pay more taxes in future.
Matt Brittin, head of Google Europe, told the BBC: ""Today we announced that we are going to be paying more tax in the UK.
""The rules are changing internationally and the UK government is taking the lead in applying those rules so we'll be changing what we are doing here. We want to ensure that we pay the right amount of tax.""
Tax inquiry
HMRC acted after controversy over the low level of taxes paid by big companies that operate in the UK but have headquarters abroad.
Despite the UK being one of Google's biggest markets, it paid £20.4m in taxes in 2013. The value of its sales in Britain that year was £3.8bn. Google makes most of its UK profits through online advertising here.
The company has been criticised for its complex international tax structures.
Its European headquarters are in Ireland, which has a lower corporation tax rate than the UK.
It has also used company structures in Bermuda - where the corporation tax rate is zero - to shelter profits.
Such moves are legal and Google - a US business, which pays the majority of its taxes there - says it has abided by international tax rules.
Accounting change
The firm has now agreed to change its accounting system so that a higher proportion of sales activity is registered in Britain rather than Ireland.
It has pledged to pay more tax on those sales in the future.
It has also said that it will use a different structure to account for its profits in the UK from 2005 until 2015.
""We are paying £130m in respect of previous years when the rules were to pay in respect of profits you make in a country and then going forward we will also be paying in respect of sales to UK customers,"" Mr Brittin said.
Asked whether the back-payments showed Google's critics were right that the company had avoiding paying tax in the past, Mr Brittin replied: ""No.""
He continued: ""We were applying the rules as they were and that was then and now we are going to be applying the new rules, which means we will be paying more tax.
""I think there was concern that international companies were paying only in respect of profits that they make and those were the rules and the pressure was to see us pay in respect of the sales we make to UK customers - and the same for other companies.
""So, we are making a change because we want to continue to comply with the rules and the rules are changing.""
Stinging attacks
An HMRC spokesman said: ""The successful conclusion of HMRC enquiries has secured a substantial result, which means that Google will pay the full tax due in law on profits that belong in the UK.
""Multinational companies must pay the tax that is due and we do not accept less.""
He added that HMRC enforces tax rules regardless of the size of the company.
Google, along with other US companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Starbucks, have faced heavy criticism for their tax affairs.
Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and former chairwoman of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, described its tax structures as ""devious, calculated and, in my view, unethical"".
She said that Google was avoiding paying its ""fair share"" of tax.
John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the agreement looked like a ""sweetheart deal"" and called for HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google had owed.
He said people will be ""sceptical"" about the firm paying what he called a ""relatively trivial"" amount of money, saying he would raise the issue in Parliament next week.
Conservative MP Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury select committee, said the agreement represented a ""relatively small"" amount of money compared with Google's UK profits.
'Strong' market
Global tax rules have been tightened over the last year, with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which produces guidance on world tax agreements, saying that multinational companies should not deliberately move profits to different countries to avoid tax.
""I think the international rules are quite complicated and the OECD has just gone through a big process to try to simplify them and that is why the rules are changing,"" Mr Brittin said.
""If we were British, we would make most of our profits in the UK and we'd be paying a lot more tax in the UK.
""The facts are we are an American company and that is where we pay the majority of our taxes, that is where we make the majority of our profits.
""But what is changing is outside the US, in international markets, we will be paying now in respect of our sales, not just our profits.""
Mr Brittin also said the UK was a strong market for Google.
""I think it is right that where there is public concern and where politicians and the press are concerned about international companies - not just us - when the rules change you should change with them and we have done that,"" he said.
""Of course what you want to be doing as a business is focusing on building amazing products and hiring people and helping the UK make the most of the internet opportunity, and that is what we want to spend our time doing.""",5758
642145732435292160,false,Poll: @HillaryClinton's lead over @BernieSanders shrinks as her edge over GOP vanishes http://t.co/TaMch3jQ2s http://t.co/BGz6wgRMQY,http://cnn.it/1NsDRVu,True,Clinton's lead over Sanders shrinks as her edge over GOP vanishes,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination has fallen to just 10 points, and at the same time, her advantage in hypothetical general election matchups against the top Republican contenders has vanished, a new CNN/ORC poll has found.
The new poll finds Clinton with 37% support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, down 10 points since August, followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 27% and Vice President Joe Biden at 20%. Sanders' support is about the same as it was in August, making Biden the only candidate to post significant gains in the last month. His support is up 6 points in the last month as he weighs making a run for the presidency.
Behind the top three, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley holds 3%, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb is at 2% and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee logs less than 1% support.
In the general election matchups, Clinton trails former neurosurgeon Ben Carson by a significant margin (51% Carson to 46% Clinton among registered voters) while running about evenly with both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (49% Bush to 47% Clinton) and businessman Donald Trump (48% back each).
READ THE POLL RESULTS
The shift away from the former secretary of state stems from shrinking support among women. Clinton's advantage among women has disappeared in matchups against Bush and Carson. Facing Trump, Clinton still carries women by a large, though tighter, margin. In August, 60% of women favored Clinton to 37% for Trump, but that's narrowed slightly to 55% Clinton, 41% Trump now. Clinton's advantage among women against Trump is fueled by independent women, despite that group shifting away from Clinton in the head-to-head against Bush.
The poll suggests Republican women have consolidated their support around their party's front-runners in the last month, and are now more apt to back both Bush and Trump than they were a month ago. At the same time, the near-universal support for Clinton among Democratic women has softened slightly, bringing it more in-line with her support among Democratic men.
With Biden's consideration of a run for the White House gaining attention, the poll finds he outperforms Clinton in these hypothetical general election matchups, topping Bush and Trump while falling just slightly behind Carson. Biden tops Trump by 10 points (54% to 44% among registered voters), leads Bush by 8 points (52% to 44%) and is 3 points behind Carson (50% Carson to 47% Biden). Biden's advantages against Bush and Trump rest on the same kind of gender gap that Clinton appears to have lost: Biden leads Bush by 16 points among women while tying him among men, he tops Trump by 26 points among women while trailing him by 7 among men, and he leads Carson by 5 among women while trailing by 10 among men.
The poll also finds Democrats' overall enthusiasm for Clinton has waned. In April, shortly after she launched her campaign, 60% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they would be enthusiastic about her candidacy should she win the party's nomination for president. Now, just 43% feel that way. But neither Biden nor Sanders has mustered that level of enthusiasm among the Democratic faithful, 37% say they would be enthusiastic about Biden, 31% about Sanders. And Sanders prompts the greatest potential dissatisfaction, with 30% saying they would be dissatisfied or upset if he eventually won the party's nomination.
Clinton 'pleads guilty' to being a moderate
Clinton's fade in the Democratic race comes as an ideological divide within the party grows into a chasm. In August, Clinton held support from 43% of moderates and 46% of liberals. In the new poll, her support among moderates holds at 47%, while among liberals, it has plummeted to just 23%. Sanders has increased his share of the liberal vote (from 42% to 49%), while falling 9 points among moderates (from 24% to 15%). Meanwhile, Biden has gained ground in both groups.
And enthusiasm for Clinton among liberals has fallen nearly 40 points. Just 29% of liberal Democrats say they would be enthusiastic if she were the party's nominee, down from 68% in an April poll.
Asked why they back their candidate, most Clinton supporters said her experience is the draw: 58% say it's mostly on account of her on the job experience, 32% because of her positions on the issues, and 9% because they don't like the other candidates. Among those Democrats backing her rivals for the nomination, 55% say their choice was driven by the candidate's positions on the issues, while 27% cite experience and 17% say it's due to dislike of the other candidates.
Donald Trump: Debating Clinton 'would be one of the easy challenges of my life'
There is some good news for Clinton in the poll, however, since most Democrats still say they expect her to be the party's eventual nominee and the more enthusiastic Democratic voters are more apt to be Clinton backers. Among Democrats and Democatic-leaning voters, 65% expect Clinton to top the party's ticket in 2016. And among those Democratic voters who say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president next year -- a group which may be more likely to cast ballots in next year's primary contests -- 42% back Clinton, 29% Sanders and 15% Biden.
The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone September 4-8 among a random national sample of 1,012 adults. This sample included 930 interviews with registered voters, 395 of whom were self-identified Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. For results among all registered voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Among Democratic voters, it is plus or minus 5 points.",5677

Lisa Lerer, a reporter covering Clinton's campaign for the Associated Press, was on hand for the latest moment conspiracy theorists have latched onto in an attempt to discredit the Democratic nominee.
In the video, which was shot on June 10 at a muffin shop in Washington DC, Lerer was one of the reporters who 'shouted' questions at Clinton about a meeting she had recently had with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
In Lerer's words, Clinton: 'perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume [she] responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds.'

In the video, which was shot on June 10 at a muffin shop in Washington DC, Clinton 'responded with an exaggerated motion', after being asked questions by reporters
'Video of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her, laughing and stepping back in surprise,' she wrote for the Associated Press.
'After the exchange, she took a few more photos, exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside.'
However, almost two months after the 'innocuous' incident took place, it was being broadcast and analyzed by right-wing host Sean Hannity and a 'Fox News Medical A-Team'.
By devoting a week of his show to the conspiracy theory, the host exposed it to more mainstream attention than ever.
Hannity, who has publicly endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump and previously supported the debunked Barack Obama 'birther' movement, told his hand-picked panel of medical experts Clinton's movement in the video appeared 'seizure-esque'.
'This looks like violent, out of control movements on her part,' the Fox News host said.

Fox News host Sean Hannity has dedicated a week of his show to 'Hillary's Health', including many segments about Clinton's response in the video (right)
Hannity also referenced an old picture that was wrongly circulated by right-wing websites recently that showed the Democratic nominee slipping while walking up a flight of stairs.
A host of anti-Clinton blogs and websites falsely presented the image as proof the 68-year-old candidate is in poor health.
However, the picture that they claimed to be new, was taken at the top of a staircase in South Carolina on February 24.
Right-wing blog American Mirror started its conspiracy-theorizing post by stating Clinton's health should be 'a major issue of the 2016 campaign'.
Right-wing websites are circulating an old picture of Hillary Clinton slipping while walking up a flight of stairs (pictured) to question the Democratic nominee's health ahead of the election
It then went on to wrongly say the photograph in question is, 'the latest evidence', to support its conspiracy - despite the picture being almost seven months old.
The blog post was then shared by the Drudge Report, a more well-known right-wing website, along with the headline: 'Hillary conquers the stairs'.
The website also linked the incorrect story to other 'incidents' with Clinton in the past, such as the time she tripped while getting on a plane in 2012, when she fractured her elbow after slipping over in the White House in 2009, and when she was treated for blood clots in 2012 and 2013, to try to add more weight to the health conspiracy.
CNN host Brian Stelter attempted to correct the blog posts after the surfaced on Twitter.

' Pro-Trump accounts shared the out-of-context pic last night. Then American Mirror wrote a ""SHOCK PHOTO"" blog post.
'Now it's the lead on Druge Report - ""PHOTOS REVEALED."" Huh? ""Clinton slips"" pics were published in February.'
Clinton has long insisted she is in good health in an attempt to put an end to the conspiracy theories, and in September 2015 she took the extraordinary step of releasing a letter from her doctor proving her fitness.
The conspiracy theories linked the photograph of Clinton slipping to when she fractured her elbow in 2009, and had to wear a sling (pictured)
The right-wing theories also referenced previous treatment Clinton had for blood clots in 2012. Pictured, Clinton leaves hospital in January 2013 after treatment
Doctor Lisa Bardack, from New York, detailed the candidate's health history, including previous treatments for concussion, complete family history of heart disease, an analysis of blood clots, and a thyroid gland examination, according to the New York Post.
Doctor Bardack found Clinton's cancer screening tests were normal, as were her electrocardiogram and her blood lipids.
Right-wing websites and outlets have regularly attempted to push conspiracy theories designed to undermine Democratic candidates in recent years - such as the 'birther movement' that questioned where President Barack Obama was born, and former President Bill Clinton had a 'body count' of questionable deaths linked to him.",5632
778681502825451520,unverified,"Black men have legitimate reason to run from police – #Massachusetts supreme court
https://t.co/MUQpXjSyyR https://t.co/AuWYZ93U91",http://on.rt.com/7px6,True,Black men have legitimate reason to run from police – Massachusetts supreme court,"Based on the disproportionate number of police stops of black males in Boston and a state law that does not require individuals to speak to police or remain in their presence, Massachusetts’ highest court ruled that a black man had reason to flee police.
The case before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was based on the gun conviction of Jimmy Warren, who was arrested in December 2011 while Roxbury police investigated a break-in. Based on a description of ""dark clothing,"" police approached Warren and another man. The pair ran from the cops, but were later searched and arrested. Warren was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm even though he was not armed at the time of his arrest. An unlicensed gun had been recovered by police in a nearby yard, WBUR reported, and Warren was eventually convicted.
In throwing out Warren's conviction, the high court said that police did not have a reason to stop and search Warren, as they did not have reasonable suspicion for the stop.
""Lacking any information about facial features, hairstyles, skin tone, height, weight, or other physical characteristics, the victim's description 'contribute[d] nothing to the officers' ability to distinguish the defendant from any other black male' wearing dark clothes and a 'hoodie' in Roxbury,"" the court said in its ruling.
The court added that the description of the clothing was too ""vague,"" and thus there was no evidence for police to ""reasonably and rationally"" target Warren or any other black man wearing dark clothing.
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court can understand why black men run from police. https://t.co/fitjdd8e3b — Anthony De Rosa (@Anthony) September 21, 2016
Citing state law that gives individuals the right to avoid speaking with police and to walk away from police if they are not charged with a crime, the court also ruled that running from police does not indicate guilt.
Furthermore, the court said that black men have more of a reason to flee based on racial profiling. To back up its point, the court referenced data on police stops released by the Boston Police Department and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts that showed black individuals have been disproportionately stopped by Boston-area police.
The court said it considered 2014 Boston police data, which found that black persons were 8 percent more likely to be stopped repeatedly and 12 percent more likely to be search and frisked no matter certain conditions like criminal history, and a 2014 ACLU report, which found disproportionate police attention was paid to black persons in Boston from 2007 to 2010, that documented ""a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston.""
""We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop,"" the court wrote in its ruling. ""However, in such circumstances, flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt. Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted for FIO [Field Interrogation and Observation] encounters suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt.""
The court added: ""Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity. Given this reality for black males in the city of Boston, a judge should, in appropriate cases, consider the report's findings in weighing flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.""
Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans said the court's decision relied too heavily on the ""tainted"" ACLU report.
In contrast to a ruling by state’s high court, Boston police insisted that they did not engage in racial profiling https://t.co/zYAoW23D01 — The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) September 21, 2016
""I think they relied heavily on an ACLU report that I think was clearly way out of context,"" Evans said Tuesday, according WBUR. ""I’m a little disappointed that they relied heavily on a report that didn’t take into context who was stopped and why. That report clearly shows that we were targeting the individuals that were driving violence in the city and the hot spots.""
Evans insisted his department's report did not indicate racial bias in police stops.

Matthew Segal, legal director of the state's ACLU chapter, hailed the court's ""powerful ruling.""
""The state’s highest court, in talking about people of color, it’s saying that their lives matter and under the law, their views matter,"" Segal said. ""The reason that’s significant is that all the time in police-civilian encounters there are disputes about what is suspicious and what is not suspicious. So this is an opinion that looks at those encounters through the eyes of a black man who might justifiably be concerned that he will be the victim of profiling.""

As these policies proliferate across the country, the number of stories of predators threatening women and children in public restrooms is also growing by the day.
The Target department store chain drew the ire of millions of Americans after it announced it was opening its bathrooms to transgender shoppers and employees and allowing them to choose whatever bathroom they feel like using at any given time.
Days later a #BoycottTarget petition effort launched that drew over 200,000 signatures in a day and over 300,000 by the weekend.
The current imbroglio should not be a surprise, as for years Target has been a big purveyor and supporter of gay-friendly policies and causes. So, this current bathroom policy issue is not the first time the chain waded into left-wing issues.
On its corporate website, for instance, there are many posts and announcements celebrating the LGBT lifestyle.
Furthermore, last year, Target was a corporate sponsor of the “Out & Equal” conference, a summit aimed at forcing corporations into adopting gay-friendly workplace policies.
The company was also praised by gay groups for its “It Gets Better” campaign meant to boost the status of homosexuality in the U.S.
In addition, Target raised the ire of many with its decision to re-engineer its kids’ sections, when in August of 2015 the chain announced it was eliminating “gender specific” labels and store signage for kids’ clothing and toy sections.
The radical homosexual agenda is not the only liberal issue Target has taken on. Two years ago the company demanded that customers “not bring firearms” into stores, despite legal concealed-carry laws saying gun owners may do so.
The company also has a long list of political causes and candidates it has donated to over the years.
Still, in defense of such polices, liberals ask what harm could come to anyone if bathrooms are opened up to men dressed as women, or others who claim to be transgender? On the other hand, those who reject these policies ask why the nation should put women and children in danger by allowing predators to more easily enter and install video cameras in bathrooms and changing rooms or otherwise threaten and harass people using the restroom?
Target itself has had incidents of predators threatening children in its bathrooms. Only weeks ago such an incident occurred in a Cedar Park, Texas store.
But there are dozens of such stories over the last 16 months or so highlighting the problem with setting policies that would make access to public restrooms easier for predators.
First up are five incidents in which predatory men were discovered committing criminal actions in public restrooms. Some of these men were arrested while dressed as women; others claimed to be transgender women.
Man in women’s locker room cites gender rule Seattle Parks and Recreation is facing a first-of-a-kind challenge to gender bathroom rules. A man undressed in a women’s locker room, citing a new state rule that allows people to choose a bathroom based on gender identity. Man Dressed as Woman Arrested for Spying Into Mall Bathroom Stall, Police Say A man dressed as a woman was arrested in Virginia on Monday after police say he was caught peeping into restroom stalls three times in the past year. Richard Rodriguez, 30, filmed a woman in a bathroom stall at the Potomac Mills Mall, Prince William County Police said on Tuesday. A 35-year-old woman was in the stall when she saw a bag moved toward her under the stall divider. Rodriguez apparently had been filming her, police said. Palmdale man arrested for videotaping in women’s bathroom PALMDALE – A 33-year-old Palmdale man who allegedly dressed as a woman while secretly videotaping females using a department store bathroom was charged with several misdemeanor counts Tuesday, authorities said. Jason Pomare was charged with six counts of unlawful use of a concealed camera for the purposes of sexual gratification, according to Sergeant Brian Hudson of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau. Sexual predator jailed after claiming to be ‘transgender’ to assault women in shelter A biological man claiming to be ‘transgender’ so as to gain access to and prey on women at two Toronto shelters was jailed “indefinitely” last week after being declared by a judge a “dangerous offender.” Pro-family leaders are pointing out that this is exactly the type of incident they warned of as the Ontario government passed its “gender identity” bill, dubbed the “bathroom bill,” in 2012. University of Toronto Dumps Transgender Bathrooms After Peeping Incidents The administration at the University of Toronto was recently enlightened on why two separate washrooms are generally established for men and women sharing co-ed residencies.
Here are nineteen more stories of predators using public bathrooms to criminally victimize women and children:
With all these stories, it is also apropos to ask just how many Americans these transgender polices would affect. By even the most generous estimations only .3 percent of the nation claims to be transgender. So, in the end, these extreme policies of bending over backwards for people who claim to be transgender are designed for less than half of one percent of Americans.

GREEN BAY, Wisconsin — After saying on Wednesday that he believes there should be punishment for women who undergo abortions if the procedure was outlawed, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walked back the comment hours later.
In an exclusive interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, the GOP front-runner described himself multiple times as “pro-life” but struggled to define what the legal ramifications of that position should be. When continually pressed for what the answer is regarding punishing women who would break any theoretical ban, Trump said the “answer is that there has to be some form of punishment, yeah.”
Later in the day, his campaign released a statement refocusing who would be punished should abortion become illegal. “If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,” the statement said. “The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.”

When asked what kind of punishment he had in mind, Trump lacked specifics and said that he has “not determined what the punishment would be.” Trump noted that he does “take positions on everything else, but this is a very complicated position.""
“If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law,” Matthews stated, making the pivot from the moral position of being pro-life to the practical implications of implementing that position in the law.
Trump asked Matthews, “are you going to say, well wait, are you going to say put them in jail? Is that the punishment you’re talking about?”
Matthews responded that that’s the question he was asking the front-runner himself. Trump responded that he was pro-life.

The MSNBC host followed up wondering if a man should bear responsibility for abortions as well, to which Trump said “no,” he didn’t think so.
Trump asked repeatedly about the Catholic church’s position on abortion, at multiple points trying to turn the questions on the interviewer himself in relation to how he squared the moral position of the church with the real life implications.

Should the United States change the law of the land on abortion as set by the landmark SCOTUS ruling Roe vs Wade Trump said, “you’ll go back to a position like they had where people will, perhaps, go to illegal places.” Still, he maintains “you have to ban it.”
Ohio Republican John Kasich, who participated in an MSNBC town hall moderated by NBC's Chuck Todd earlier in the day, was asked if he agreed with Trump on the prospect of punishing women for abortion. ""Absolutely not,"" Kasich responded. ""I do have exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother but of course women shouldn’t be punished,"" he added.

In Wednesday's town hall meeting, Trump also continued the defense of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, saying that he didn’t think an initial apology from his campaign manager would’ve changed the current situation.
“I think if he called up to apologize I think we’d be in the exact same place,” he told Matthews, wondering if Lewandowski may have even apologized in the moment. “They’re destroying a very good person…over nothing” Trump said. “He’s a good person with a wonderful family.""
Trump called the incident in question “so minor"" before continuing to discredit former Brietbart reporter Michelle Fields by attacking the premise of her story. “What’s contact?” he hedged, noting that her facial expression didn’t change despite saying she was almost pulled to the ground by Lewandowski. Trump later added that he was “skeptical” about her.
Related: Trump on Campaign Manager -- ""I Can't Destroy a Man.""
The GOP front-runner says “nobody respects women” more than he does. That respect, however, doesn’t necessarily translate to Fields. “I would say I don’t have great respect for her,” Trump told Matthews. He also dodged when asked why he didn’t have sympathy for Fields, instead pointing out that the tape being used by the police investigation was his tape and saying that there are more pressing issues at play, like ISIS and foreign threats.

Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear President Obama,
In the wake of another round of appalling terrorist attacks, I write to express great sadness at the events in Paris, as well as my grave concern about the unreported diffusion of Syrian refugees in the United States.
Last week, the city of New Orleans began receiving its first wave of Syrian refugees. As with former immigration crises and federal relocation policy, Louisiana has been kept in the dark about those seeking refuge in the state. It is irresponsible and severely disconcerting to place individuals, who may have ties to ISIS, in a state without the state’s knowledge or involvement.
As Governor of Louisiana, I demand information about the Syrian refugees being placed in Louisiana in hopes that the night of horror in Paris is not duplicated here. In the wake of these atrocities, I also ask for details on the below:
What level of background screening was conducted prior to entry in the United States?
In light of the fact that some of those responsible for last night’s attacks held Syrian passports, what additional protections and screenings will be put in place?
Will all Syrian refugees seeking relocation in the United States now be cleared by the Terrorist Screening Center?
What degree of monitoring will be sustained after initial placement in Louisiana?
As Americans, we embolden freedom and opportunity to the rest of the world, but by opening up our borders and refusing to collaborate or share information with states, you are threatening that reality.
Mr. President, in light of these attacks on Paris and reports that one of the attackers was a refugee from Syria, it would be prudent to pause the process of refugees coming to the United States. Authorities need to investigate what happened in Europe before this problem comes to the United States.
Sincerely,
Governor Bobby Jindal (Source Link)

While the SJW crowd cheered the decision, realists around the country signaled their collective displeasure with a boycott of the store spearheaded by The American Family Association. In a relatively short time, more than one million people had signed on to the protest. (Fox News)
More than one million people have decided they will no longer buy their Nutter Butters or Wet Wipes at Target. The American Family Association launched a boycott of the nation’s second largest retailer a week ago – over Target’s corporate policy allowing men who identify as women to use the bathrooms and fitting rooms of their choosing. “We believe that everyone – every team member, every guest, and every community – deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally,” the company wrote in a statement. “Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.”
Is the boycott having any sort of effect in such a short period of time? These things are often hard to gauge, but in this case there seems to be a strong hint provided in the fact that the company’s stock has taken a precipitous drop during the same period. (Daily Caller)
On Friday, the shares of Target Corporation Common Stock (TGT) fell 2.52 percent in one day, according to recent reports. In addition since April 19th, the day they announced the new policy, the stock went from a share value of $84.14 to $79.27 per share. That’s a drop of 5.8 percent in 10 days. The Family Policy institute says they estimate that to be a loss to the company of $2.5 billion dollars… As previously reported, in addition to signing the “boycott pledge” the group is encouraging people to post on Target’s Facebook page that they are upset about the new policy.
While I’m not generally a fan of boycotts as a means of enacting political change, this one is understandable and, as I said above, predictable. I also find the focus of the protest message to be a bit off the mark as well, while understanding the concerns being raised. Opponents of this misguided policy at Target continue to stress the danger of sexual predators using the open bathroom access as an invitation to perpetrate assaults. While I suppose it’s possible, it also seems unlikely that a determined predator would allow a gender designation sign on a door stop them from pursuing their victims, and incidents of such attacks seem to be rare. These scenarios are less disconcerting than cases where women are forced to share locker rooms and showers with men, opening the door to creepy voyeurs breaking out their cell phone cameras and worse.
Running the debate immediately to these worst case scenarios overshadows the underlying argument to be made. What about the simple concept of propriety and privacy which any civilized person should accept? Women should not be forced to use the bathroom, change in a locker room or take a shower in front of a strange man. Is that really so difficult to understand or express in a public policy statement?
This isn’t the first time Target has dipped a toe into the troubled “gender identity” waters. Last summer we talked about the store’s new policy of “de-gendering” the toys and clothing aisles so as not to offend anyone. The sad part of all this is that this stupid, pointless battle (which was clearly going to affect the company’s sales no matter which way they went on it) was completely unnecessary. Just as with public, government facilities, there is a simple (if still costly) solution, assuming one believes that a solution is required. In fact San Francisco (of all places) hit on the idea very early in the national debate. If a company or public facility truly feels that they must jump into this entire “degendering” fiasco, then in addition to traditional facilities for each gender, simply add on a third, gender neutral bathroom or other facility. Then anyone going in can be informed that there is no gender requirement for occupancy and, likewise, the owner/management offers no guarantee as to the gender of the other patrons you may encounter in there. Alternately, when new facilities are constructed, put in multiple, single user facilities and just label them as “shower” or “bathroom” or “changing room.”
Problem solved. Then, if someone wants to insist that they must be allowed in public facilities with people of the opposite gender, their true agenda is exposed. (You will be made to not only care, but to participate.) This is an important aspect of the conversation which the SJW all to often succeeds in suppressing. We aren’t having a conversation here about discrimination or the suppression of anyone else’s rights. Dress however you wish. And for that matter, the vast majority of us aren’t going to care one way or the other what you call yourself despite the obvious denial of basic genetics and science on display. The real motivation of the SJW is to force such twisted claims on everyone else and mandate their participation even when it comes at the expense of the rights of the majority.",5338
693071538896162816,non-rumor,Orphanage Saved By Bikini Car Wash https://t.co/BXcBGnAjnH https://t.co/VSYOmbdbFK,http://onion.com/1PDRPjg,True,Orphanage Saved By Bikini Car Wash,"VAN NUYS, CA—The forces of morally upstanding civic involvement and partial nudity won out over corporate greed Saturday when a group of charitable, concerned citizens—all voluptuous young women between the ages of 19 and 23—saved a local orphanage from foreclosure at the hands of uncaring real-estate agents by holding a bikini car wash.
""By slapping each other's firm, curvaceous, tanned bodies with sopping, sudsy sponges and cavorting gleefully as we lathered cars to a gleaming sheen, my friends and I were thankfully able to generate enough community interest to raise the funds necessary to save the orphanage,"" said Van Nuys-area bleach-blonde bombshell Kelli Dee, the woman credited with leading the charity effort, at a poolside press conference Monday. ""I'm just glad the people of this city rallied so enthusiastically around our cause. They have proven that, even in these cynical times, people still care about what's truly important: helping kids.""
For her efforts, Dee was given the Van Nuys Civic Association's Upstanding Citizen Award, during the acceptance of which her left breast briefly spilled from her sun dress, momentarily revealing her taut nipple to the cheering crowd.
Dee, sources said, first became involved in the fight to save the orphanage just one week ago, when she arrived in Southern California to live with her long-lost Aunt Muriel while pursuing her dream of becoming a model and actress.
""Imagine my surprise,"" a smiling Dee told reporters, ""when, upon showing up at the address I'd been given by my aunt, I found that it was actually a church orphanage, and that Aunt Muriel, who had quite a reputation as a 'party girl' back in her day, was now Sister Muriel the nun!""
But the mood of jubilant reunion quickly turned sour when Dee learned that the orphanage, Holy Mother Of Christ In Heaven Nunnery And Home For Wayward Waifs, was in danger of being bulldozed by heartless real-estate developer J. Phineas Thadwick III to make room for a celebrity-themed chain restaurant and bar.
""He said we only had one week to pay the overdue mortgage,"" Sister Muriel said. ""Kelli, God bless her, wanted to help, but she was penniless. Every last cent she had left over after her extensive series of breast-augmentation surgeries went toward paying for the bus ticket here from Iowa.""
All seemed lost, Dee said, until she convinced her new friends from the beach to help raise the money by holding a car wash. ""At first they didn't accept me and were sure my idea would never work,"" she said. ""But after a giggly pillow fight, during which we playfully tugged off each other's flimsy nighties, I was able to earn their trust.""
Defying the odds, the girls' entrepreneurial fund-raising scheme ultimately paid off.
""Normally, I'd feel a sick sense of self-abasing shame for ogling such blatantly gratuitous female nudity,"" said customer Norm Radchek, who had his car scrubbed clean an estimated two dozen times during the weekend event. ""But luckily, the knowledge that it was all for the sake of the orphanage enabled me to maintain the moral high ground while doing so.""
Sister Muriel praised her niece's generosity and dedication to the orphanage. ""It was very brave of Kelli to selflessly press her soapy, thonged butt cheeks against the cars' windshields for a good cause,"" she said. ""I thank heaven that the young ladies' skimpy swimwear was able to raise so much awareness and help these poor children.""
Despite the overwhelmingly positive response generated by the car wash, success did not come easily. Before the money could be raised, the girls first had to overcome a number of attempts by Thadwick and his real-estate cronies to sabotage the event.
Among the developers' more ruthless ploys to lure potential customers away from the fundraiser: the organization of a wet T-shirt contest across the street using a rival group of ""slutty"" topless women who stood in sharp contrast to the wholesome topless women of the car wash.
Additionally, an 11th-hour attempt by the developers to revoke the girls' car-wash license was defeated when Thadwick, brandishing a fistful of intimidating-looking forms from the County Assessor's office, was pushed into a swimming pool by pro-orphanage community members.
""Kelli and her bimbo friends haven't heard the last of J. Phineas Thadwick III!"" a visibly humiliated Thadwick told reporters during the victory volleyball celebration that immediately followed his soaking-wet defeat. ""Just look at this suit! It's ruined!""
Dee said she couldn't be happier with the way things worked out. ""We saved the orphanage, I made a lot of new friends, and practically everybody in town saw me naked from the waist up on multiple occasions,"" she said. ""What more could a simple Iowa girl want?""
Dee's future plans include taking voice lessons, helping her aunt around the orphanage, and dating a boy so shy and nerdy that he assumed a sexy dreamgirl like her would never even look at him.
""Ironically, the fact that he is so shy and nerdy is the very reason I like him,"" she said.
A documentary about the struggle to save the orphanage is currently being filmed by New Line Cinema and should be available in the ""Wild Comedy"" section of Blockbuster Video by the end of the year.",5338

Three to four million people could be infected with Zika virus in the Americas this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts.
Most will not develop symptoms, but the virus, spread by mosquitoes, has been linked to brain defects in babies.
Meanwhile, the US says it hopes to begin human vaccine trials by the end of 2016.
The head of the International Olympic Committee says steps are being taken to protect the Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Thomas Bach said the IOC would issue advice this week on how to keep athletes and visitors safe in Brazil, the worst affected country.
WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said Zika had gone ""from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions"".
She has set up a Zika ""emergency team"" after the ""explosive"" spread of the virus.
It will meet on Monday to decide whether Zika should be treated as a global emergency.
The last time an international emergency was declared was for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people.
Zika: What you need to know
Zika was first detected in Uganda in 1947, but has never caused an outbreak on this scale.
Brazil reported the first cases of Zika in South America in May 2015.
Most cases result in no symptoms and it is hard to test for, but WHO officials said between 500,000 and 1.5 million people had been infected in the country.
The virus has since spread to more than 20 countries in the region.
At the same time there has been a steep rise in levels of microcephaly - babies born with abnormally small heads - and the rare nervous system disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.
The link between the virus and these disorders has not been confirmed, but Dr Chan said it was ""strongly suspected"" and was ""deeply alarming"".
And she warned the situation could yet deteriorate as ""this year's El Nino weather patterns are expected to increase mosquito populations greatly in many areas"".
The BBC's David Shukman, reporting from Recife in north-east Brazil, said doctors were ""overwhelmed"" by cases of microcephaly.
One hospital in the city had gone from dealing with an average of five cases a year to 300 in the past six months.

Emergency team
Earlier, doctors writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association said Zika had ""explosive pandemic potential"" and said the WHO's failure to act swiftly on Ebola probably cost thousands of lives.
In a statement to the executive board meeting of the WHO, Dr Chan said: ""The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty.
""Questions abound - we need to get some answers quickly.
""For all these reasons, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee.
""I am asking the Committee for advice on the appropriate level of international concern and for recommended measures that should be undertaken in affected countries and elsewhere.""
Vaccine
Officials from the US National Institute of Health said they had two potential Zika vaccines in development.
One that is based on an experimental West Nile vaccine could be repurposed for Zika and enter clinical trials by the end of 2016, Dr Anthony Fauci from NIH said.
He said talks were already taking place with pharmaceutical companies, but a vaccine would not be widely available for several years.
Meanwhile Dr Anne Schuchat, from the Centers for Disease Control confirmed there had been 31 cases of Zika in the country - all linked to travel to the affected areas.
At a news conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the country's response to the virus so far had been ""consistent with the kind of threat that could be out there"".
""At this point, here in the United States, the risk of a disease spread by mosquitoes is quite low, the January temperatures in North America are quite inhospitable to the mosquito populations.""
""But, obviously that's going to change,"" he added.
Dr Carissa Etienne, the regional-director for the WHO Pan American Health Organization, said the link between the abnormalities and Zika had not been confirmed.
But she added: ""We cannot tolerate the prospect of more babies being born with neurological and other malformations and more people facing the threat of paralysis.""

693013768738115584,non-rumor,UK heterosexual couple who want to enter civil partnership rather than marry lose challenge at London's High Court https://t.co/iUSFxDhdJa,http://bbc.in/1QK4fez,True,Heterosexual couple lose civil partnership court challenge,"Image copyright PA Image caption Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld want their relationship recognised in law, but they do not want to get married
A heterosexual couple who want to have a civil partnership rather than get married have lost a legal challenge.
Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, from London, were told in 2014 that they could not have a civil partnership because they did not meet the legal requirement of being of the same sex.
They took their case to the High Court, saying they faced discrimination.
But Mrs Justice Andrews dismissed their claim for judicial review. The couple have said they intend to appeal.
One of the government's arguments was that now gay couples are able to marry, civil partnerships might be abolished or phased out in the future, and changing legislation before then would be ""costly and complex"".
A government spokesperson welcomed the ruling, saying the ""current regime of marriage and civil partnership does not disadvantage opposite sex couples"".
Family values
Ms Steinfeld, 34, and Mr Keidan, 39, said they wanted to commit to each other in a civil partnership as it ""focuses on equality"" and did not carry the patriarchal history and associations of marriage.
However, the Civil Partnership Act 2004 - which applies throughout the UK - requires that partners be ""two people of the same sex"". It grants gay couples legal rights similar to those given to married couples.
The introduction of same-sex marriage - which became legal in England, Wales and Scotland in 2014 - has since given gay couples a choice between that and civil partnership.
Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan argued that, as a heterosexual couple, they did not have the same choice as gay couples and were therefore discriminated against.
Current legislation was ""incompatible"" with their right to a private and family life, they said.
The government argued that civil marriage was an institution that protected the core values of family life and was entirely egalitarian, and that where the objection was ideological there was no infringement of rights.
Analysis
Image copyright PA
By Clive Coleman, BBC legal affairs correspondent
Some observers will be surprised by today's ruling. An important part of the foundation of modern human rights and equality law is the protection against discrimination on grounds including sexual orientation.
The Civil Partnership Act 2004 appears to fly directly in the face of that.
It requires civil partners to be ""two people of the same sex"", meaning gay couples can now choose marriage or a civil partnership, whilst heterosexual couples can only marry.
However, Mrs Justice Andrews ruled that the different treatment of gay and opposite-sex couples didn't infringe the right to a private and family life enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
And even if it did, maintaining the different treatment is justified, essentially because opposite-sex couples can enter civil marriages, which are egalitarian and encompass the core principles of family life.
After the ruling, Ms Steinfeld said the government was ""barring us, and many thousands of opposite-sex couples like us, from the choice of forming a civil partnership"".
She told the BBC: ""We are very disappointed in the judge's ruling today, which we think undermines equality in the United Kingdom.
""And we know that that disappointment will be shared in the court of public opinion because we have 36,000 people who've signed our change to all petition supporting opening up civil partnerships to all.""
Mr Keidan said ""the fight goes on"" and there was still a chance ""for this wrong to be righted in time"".
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who has championed the case for equal civil partnerships for more than a decade, said the ruling was ""a sad defeat for love and equality"".
Meanwhile, Ava Lee, campaign manager of the Equal Civil Partnership campaign, said it was time the government reconsidered its position on civil partnerships
'Not disadvantaged'
At a hearing earlier this month, the government said the future of civil partnerships had not been decided.
It said it would wait ""to see how extending marriage to same-sex couples impacts upon civil partnerships before reaching a final decision on the future of civil partnerships"".
Dan Squires, counsel for the government, said ministers had decided it was ""not necessary to undertake the costly and complex exercise of extending civil partnerships in the interim where they may be abolished or phased out in a few years"".
Mrs Justice Andrews said the government was ""acting well within the ambit of discretion afforded to it with regard to the regulation of social matters"".
""Opposite-sex couples are not disadvantaged by the hiatus, because they can achieve exactly the same recognition of their relationship and the same rights, benefits and protections by getting married, as they always could,"" she said in her ruling.
She concluded: ""The government's decision to wait and see serves the legitimate aim of avoiding the unnecessary disruption and the waste of time and money that plunging into a programme of legislative reform without waiting is likely to produce.""",5210

Now classmates who attended the same school as the shooter in Port Lucie have claimed that teachers often had to deal with his unruly behavior and threats of violence against other pupils.
The claims come just a day after classmates at his high school said that Mateen openly cheered on 9/11 as they watched in horror as two hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York.
Lesley Hall, who was a 5th grade classmate of Mateen at Marisopa Elementary School in Florida told TMZ she recalls one occasion where he threatened to go on a shooting spree.
She explained that he told a group of children that he planned to bring a weapon into the school and open fire, killing everyone.
Ms Hall added that when students told teachers at the school about the threats, they were taken extremely seriously and Mateen was suspended for two weeks.
The former classmate also claimed she lived in constant fear of Mateen due to his relentless bullying of her, and even in middle school, he threw chair and spat at teachers.
The school district have so far refused to comment on the claims.
They come after reports that while Mateen was a sophomore in high school, attending a Spectrum Alternative School, a school for students with poor grades or behavioral issues, he cheered during the 9/11 attacks.
According to the Washington Post, Mateen's class was watching broadcast video of the first plane hitting one of the towers that morning when the second plane hit on live TV.
After the second plane hit, a former classmate recalls that Mateen 'stood up in class and...started jumping up-and-down cheering on the terrorist'.
Classmates say Mateen threatened to bring a gun and shoot everyone while attending Marisopa Elementary School in Port Lucie, Florida
'Mateen was smiling. It was almost like surreal how happy he was about what happened to us,' the student recalls.
The former student, who spoke anonymously to the Post for fear of his business clients learning that he attended an alternative school, said Mateen also claimed that Osama bin Laden was his uncle.
Another former classmate told the Post that Mateen started misbehaving after the two towers were hit, and that he was sent to the dean's office.
'I was sleeping in class and woke up to see people jumping off buildings, so I started swearing and they sent me up,' the former student said. 'But Omar was saying some really rude stuff. Stuff like, ""That's what America deserves."" That kind of thing. It wasn't right.'
Robert Zirkle, who was a freshman at Martin County High School at the time but who rode the same bus as the shooter, says that Mateen began taunting other students on the ride by making plane noises.
Mateen, 29, was shot dead in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Sunday morning after opening fire inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more
Zirkle says he believes Mateen was suspended or expelled from his school shortly after 9/11.
On the day of 9/11 itself, another student recalls seeing Mateen's father pick him up from school and slap him across the face in public.
'They had to escort him out of the school,' Zirkle said. 'Other kids were trying to fight him. A couple days after, they had to take him off the bus.'
'A few of my friends wanted to fight him because he kept doing it and saying crazy things,' he added. 'It's weird. He was totally cool before 9/11, and then something changed.'
Mateen's lasting fascination with terrorists was obvious when he called 911 from inside the Pulse nightclub on Sunday.

FBI Director James Comey said in a statement on Monday that the shooter was involved in precisely three calls to a 911 dispatcher at approximately 2:30am.
Comey said: 'He (Mateen) called and hung up. He called again and spoke with the dispatcher and hung up.
'And the dispatcher called him back and they spoke briefly.
'During the calls he said he was doing this for the leader of ISIS, who he named, and pledged loyalty to.
'But he also appeared to claim solidarity with the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombings and solidarity with the Florida man who died as a suicideb bomber in Syria for Al-Nusra Front - a group in conflict with the so-called Islamic State.",5177

I didn't say anything on the way back from the stadium, because I was collecting my thoughts. But now, I think it's time we clear the air. Look, you know I've always loved and supported you. I believe you are, at heart, sweet, romantic, intelligent, capable, and wise. But something happens when the eyes of an entire stadium are on you, and it makes me wonder whether I even know you. Dave, I don't like the person you become when you're on the Jumbotron.
The Dave I know is polite, modest, and content. Jumbotron Dave is crass and loud. The Dave I know has a sweet, gentle smile. Jumbotron Dave has a tongue that waggles and undulates lasciviously. Accompanied by your red cheeks, your bulging eyes, and that ""metal"" gesture you do with your hands—it's horrifying. What comes over you, Dave?
Don't give me that ""I like the attention, but I don't need it"" stuff. I know you think you don't get on the Jumbotron often enough for it to be a problem, and I know you think that your little display doesn't hurt anyone. But seeing you that way hurts me. Because I know you're better than that disco-dancing lunatic up on the screen.
I never said you control the cameraman, but once he chooses you, you are responsible for your actions. Wouldn't a grin and a wave do the job? Couldn't you just hold up a team pennant? Even a tasteful sign? I think the Seahawks would prefer the image of a well-mannered fan to some screaming guy who pulls up his shirt to flash a pair of chalky-white man-breasts planted with sprigs of chest hair and nipples the size of saucers. What's ""fun"" or ""funny"" about that, Dave?
And the sounds you make! The Dave I know has a voice so gentle and sweet that I often save his phone messages. Jumbotron Dave has a voice that I would hesitate to call human. It's more a series of guttural whoops and bellows. You do realize that they can't hear you, right, Dave? Okay, well, if you're going to yell anyway, why not at least yell something simple, so people can read your lips? You could try ""Seahawks!"" or ""Touchdown!"" instead of those nonsense words you were yelling earlier tonight when you were gesturing from your beer to the field to the air. Honestly, Dave, why? No one watching the jumbotron can hear you, you know.
You never think about my feelings. I'm on that Jumbotron, too, you know. I have as much right as you to jab my index finger in the air and shout, ""We're No. 1! We're No. 1!"" Earlier this evening, in your haste to fill the Jumbotron screen with your pasty expanse, you blotted me out of the picture completely. Not only did you prevent me from raising a finger into the air and shouting, ""We're No. 1!"" but you also jabbed me in the eye with your elbow and sent my pretzel nuggets flying.
No, I'm not asking that you hide your face in the event you do get on the Jumbotron. That's silly. All I ask is that you use the Jumbotron responsibly, like Ellen's fiancé Jack. When Jack gets on the 'tron, he smiles, gives the thumbs up, and points to his Matt Hasselbeck jersey. Then he looks back at the game. Very classy and dignified. Like you, he's at the game to have fun and it shows. But unlike you, he doesn't let the Jumbotron change him into a screaming lunatic. He's an adult. And, like an adult, he knows he doesn't need to outdo everyone else who's ever been on the Jumbotron before. He knows that that sort of one-upmanship leads to trouble. That rainbow-wigged John 3:16 guy is in jail right now. Did you know that, Dave? Prison.
I remember the first time I saw your darker, LED-displayed side. It was the Mariners-Brewers game at the Kingdome in 1996, and I was thrilled just to be close to you. We'd been dating for two months, and I was head-over-heels in love. Then, suddenly, we were on that gigantic screen together. Before I could even react, you leapt onto your seat and poured a beer over your head.
At the time, I laughed. A half-thought, ""something is very wrong here,"" scuttled through the back of my mind, but I ignored it. Around the start of the seventh inning, the fact that my date was drenched in beer began to trouble me. But you weren't troubled a bit. It was as though you'd shut out reality. I watched you. You glanced up at the Jumbotron every few seconds, Dave. You were dying to unleash the monster again. Looking back, I don't think the Mariners' victory even mattered to you.
The Jumbotron is a way for fans to express their excitement and show pride in their favorite teams. Jumbotron appearances can be beautiful and sweet. People hold up their children. Some fans use the Jumbotron to send greetings to their mothers or propose to their girlfriends. They let the Jumbotron blow up the good aspects of their personalities. They don't let their most grotesque and vile characteristics take over.
Dave, I am only trying to help you. But I must warn you that I can't tolerate this side of you. Next month, we have tickets to see Mannheim Steamroller. I happen to know there's a Jumbotron in the arena. If you apply any red and green paint to your face before we go, you and I are through.",5128
552802654641225728,true,Charlie Hebdo shooting latest: 12 dead and gunmen still at large http://t.co/6jRqXgPogM http://t.co/hO7lvftma5,http://i100.io/W5R7DKe,True,Charlie Hebdo attack: What we know,"Twelve people have been killed and five seriously injured after masked men stormed the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The incident is France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades. Paris police have said multiple shots were fired and three gunmen were involved.
Two policemen are among the dead and the gunmen remain unaccounted for. In video from the scene the words “Allahu Akbar” can be heard as shots are fired. Footage of the scene outside the magazine's offices shows the gunmen moving slowly and calmly, with one attacker bending over to toss a fallen shoe back into the small black car before fleeing the scene. The car was later found abandoned in the 19th Arrondissement of northern Paris, police said.
High profile figures at the magazine including its editor and chief cartoonist, Stéphane Charbonnier, known as “Charb”, and Jean Cabut, or “Cabu”, a veteran of several French newspapers and reportedly the highest paid cartoonist in the world, were both killed.
Charlie Hebdo's editor in chief Gérard Biard was in London at the time of the attack. He said he was ""shocked"" at the attack, adding ""a newspaper is not a weapon of war"".
Speaking from the scene, French president François Hollande said the shooting was ""undoubtedly"" a terrorist attack.
""Journalists and police officers were cowardly murdered,"" he said.
Later on Wednesday he announced a national day of mourning for France.
By Wednesday evening the gunmen were still at large despite a large scale police hunt.
Here is what we know and what we don't know.
What has been reported
One of the magazine's cartoonists Corine Rey, who is known as ""Coco"", told newspaper Humanite she let the armed men inside Charlie Hebdo's offices after being ordered to at gunpoint when she arrived there with her young child.
She said the gunmen ""spoke perfect French,"" adding ""they said they were Al Qaeda"".
The journalists were in an editorial meeting and the gunmen headed straight for the paper's editor, killing him and his police bodyguard first, according to a police union spokesman.
Four journalists (Stéphane Charbonnier, Jean Cabut, Georges Wolinski and Bernard Verlhac) have been confirmed dead and French media also reports economist Bernard Maris was amongst those killed.
The Guardian reports that it was the magazine's press day and the ""important staff"" were all there. ""We have not seen carnage like this since the Second World War,"" a police spokesperson told the newspaper's reporter Kim Willsher.
An unverified video posted by journalist Martin Boudot shows men in black firing weapons and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"".
A separate video uploaded to Facebook shows gunmen roaming the streets, with one gunman shooting a policeman in the head as he writhed on the ground. Europe1 News Journalist Pierre de Cossette has reported that several ""men in black hoods were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged'"".
Witness Benoit Bringer said: ""About a half an hour ago two black-hooded men entered the building with Kalashnikovs (guns).
""A few minutes later we heard lots of shots.""
He said two officers arrived on bicycles, then - apparently unarmed - they left.
This tweet appears to show the attackers pointing their guns at a car.
The Independent's defence correspondent Kim Sengupta reported the gunmen showed ""military precision"".
The advance of the killers down the street is deliberate and synchronised in army fashion, one covering the other before swapping positions. This gives them maximum protection, especially in an urban environment, where opponents can hide behind cars and in alleyways.
Images from the scene of the shooting at French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo
What we know
The magazine is a Private Eye-style publication whose offices were once fire-bombed in 2011 after they published a spoof issue “guest edited” by the Prophet Mohamed.
Isis has threatened to attack France, and Charlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Mohamed, among other controversial sketches.
This was the magazine's final tweet before the shooting, which translates as ""best wishes, in fact"". The cartoon caption translates as ""best wishes and to Al-Baghdadi as well"", and in the speech bubble the Isis leader is saying ""and mostly good health"".
The political reaction
The government in Paris is raising the terror alert to France's highest level.
No barbaric act will never extinguish the freedom of the press.
François Hollande
Christophe DeLoire of Reporters Without Borders said: ""This is the darkest day of the history of the French press.""
The murders in Paris are sickening. We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending freedom of press.
David Cameron
A White House spokesperson also condemned the shooting in the ""strongest possible terms"".

China's economy grew by 6.9% in 2015, compared with 7.3% a year earlier, marking its slowest growth in a quarter of a century.
China's growth, seen as a driver of the global economy, is a major concern for investors around the world.
The news comes as the International Monetary Fund said it expected China's economy to grow by 6.3% this year and 6% in 2017.
Beijing had set an official growth target of ""about 7%"".
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has said weaker growth would be acceptable as long as enough new jobs were created.
But some observers say its growth is actually much weaker than official data suggests, though Beijing denies numbers are being inflated.
Analysts said any growth below 6.8% would likely fuel calls for further economic stimulus. Economic growth in the final quarter of 2015 edged down to 6.8%, according to the country's national bureau of statistics.

Dangerous push?
After experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China's economy has experienced a painful slowdown in the last two years.
It's come as the central government wants to move towards an economy led by consumption and services, rather than one driven by exports and investment. But managing that transition has been challenging.
Some argue that China's focus on creating an economy driven by consumption is misplaced. They say as the country attempts to rebalance its economy, it should focus on productivity in order to sustain high growth.
""While higher consumption can support growth in the short run, there is little in economic theory that emphasises the expenditure side of GDP as a driver of growth,"" HSBC's John Zhu said in a note.
Mr Zhu also said that China's current stage of development would require more investment, not less, and that the country would rebalance naturally towards consumption and services in time.
""Pushing the economy along those paths too soon would be dangerous,"" he said.

Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business correspondent
It's said so often that it has become a financial markets cliché - when China sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.
The drama of China's stock market crash over the last year has affected investor sentiment and data out today is unlikely to improve matters. But frankly, news that China is slowing down shouldn't come as a surprise.
The government has been broadcasting this for some time now as it attempts to transition from a state-led investment and manufacturing economy to one more dependent on services and consumption. Those two aspects now make up 50.5% of the economy, up from 48.5% in 2014.
But the real concern is just how badly China's economy is likely to do in the future, and whether these figures can be trusted at all.
Critics say China's data is unreliable and that real growth figures may be much weaker. Recent provincial economic data has indicated that growth could be much lower than what the government says it is.
Not a meltdown

China's headline annual economic growth numbers are important to the rest of the world - but so too are other monthly economic data as they can provide a more in-depth look at the economy and where it's heading.
Monthly industrial production (IP) and retail sales numbers for China were also released on Tuesday, with both December numbers coming in just slightly worse than expected.
Industrial production - or factory output - expanded 5.9% in December, down from 6% in November. Retail sales grew 11.1%, down from 11.3% in November.
""[The] health of the labour market, retail sales and industrial production data are all key indicators for growth,"" said Catherine Yeung from Fidelity International in a note.
""Like any economic data, it's important to look at the themes and trends that drive them and not just the headline figure.
""When you look at China with this lens, we're not seeing a meltdown, just a slowdown,"" she added.
Others said Tuesday's numbers were actually a relief.
""GDP was generally in line with what many, including the IMF, expected,"" said economist Tony Nash.
""China's growth in 2015 was equivalent to the size of the entire economy of Switzerland or Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""That's not an easy feat and shows the magnitude of the accomplishment,"" he added.",5002

French authorities have named the three suspects who they believe are responsible for the shooting deaths of 12 people, U.S. law enforcement officials told ABC News.
Officials identified the suspects as Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, two relatives both in their 30s and still at large, and 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, who police say is cooperating after his surrender in the French town of Charleville-Mezieres, about 140 miles north of Paris.
Cherif Kouachi, 34, is listed in a private database, ABC News has confirmed.
Kouachi, along with six others, was sentenced in May 2008 to 3 years in prison for terrorism in Paris. All seven men were accused of sending about a dozen young Frenchmen to join Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, after funneling them through radical religious establishments in Syria and Egypt. French authorities believed Kouachi had been planning to go to Syria for training in 2005.
Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman earlier today told ABC News that two of the assailants went inside the offices of Charlie Hebdo and listed off the names of their targets before shooting them execution style. The third man was waiting outside the building.
The French president called the attack a ""terrorist operation.""
The shooting at the office of Charlie Hebdo was a ""cowardly attack,"" said President Francois Hollande when he was at the scene this morning.

""This is a terrorist operation against an office that has been threatened several times, which is why it was protected,"" he said, without going into the specifics of the police protection at the office in the center of Paris. Photos from the scene show a police car riddled with bullet holes.
The newspaper had been targeted in the past over its content, often aimed at religious groups.
French officials confirmed that there are believed to be three attackers, all of whom were seen in videos wearing black from head-to-toe. Their identities and affiliations have not been revealed but one of the men is heard screaming ""Allahu Akbar,"" an Islamic phrase meaning ""God is great,"" in one of the scene videos.

This morning's turmoil punctured an otherwise normal day in the French capital, with the gunshots audible from nearby buildings, sending bystanders cowering. The masked gunmen were later seen fleeing the scene and hijacked a car, authorities said. They have not been caught and a search is underway for the shooters.
The tragedy marks France's deadliest terror attack in decades. The government raised its terror alert to the highest level and reinforced security at houses of worship, stores, media offices and transportation.
The New York City Police Department ordered extra security to the French consulate in Manhattan and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that they are closely monitoring the events in France and are ready to adjust their ""security posture, as appropriate.""

Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, has come under attack before. Their office was firebombed in 2011 and its website was hacked after its cover featured the prophet Muhammad. Nearly a year later, the publication again published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations from around the Muslim world.
The cover of this week's issue of the newspaper focuses on a new book by Michel Houellebecq, “Submission,” which depicts France led by an Islamic party that bans women from the workplace.

701975210044497921,unverified,Study concluded that the Clinton camp has “no statistical basis” to back claims that it won Latino vote in NV. https://t.co/UTXQCQBX2y,http://fusion.net/story/271686/bernie-sanders-latino-voters-nevada/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialshare&utm_content=theme_top,True,Did Bernie Sanders really win the Latino vote in Nevada?,"The Sanders campaign is sticking to its guns and insisting that it won the Latino vote in Nevada—a claim contested by the Clinton camp following the former Secretary of State’s win in that state’s democratic primary last Saturday.
An analysis of publicly available voter data distributed to the press by the Sanders campaign concluded that the Clinton camp has “no statistical basis” to back claims that it won most of the Latino vote in Nevada. It maintains that support from young voters helped Sanders win “the Latino vote.”
Both campaigns are hungry to prove their proposals are resonating with Latino and other nonwhite voters. Though Sanders lost Nevada, it was the first battleground state where Latino voters played a significant role. Claiming victory with Latino voters there could boost either candidate’s chances of solidifying Latino support in other key states.
Soon after caucuses closed in Nevada on Saturday, the Bernie Sanders campaign sent a statement to journalists declaring Sanders had won the state’s Latino vote.
Ultimately Hillary Clinton carried the state by 5.3%, but the Sanders campaign stressed the vote returns show their campaign is gaining traction with Latinos and other non-white voters.
“What we learned today is that Hillary Clinton’s firewall with Latino voters is a myth,” Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for the Sanders campaign, wrote in the statement sent to the press.
“According to entrance polls Sanders won among Latino voters by 8 points,” read the email. But those numbers may not add up.
Clinton won about 60% of delegates in areas with a heavy Latino population, according to The New York Times, a figure that raises questions about the credibility of the entrance polls cited by the Sanders campaign.
UPDATE: In Nevada's Latino-majority precincts, Clinton won 207 delegates and Sanders won just 130. Proves entrance polls were wrong. — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) February 21, 2016
The Times cited a report, issued by a leading research group that focuses on Latinos, showing that “Mrs. Clinton was victorious in the majority of the 40 precincts in Nevada that have more than 50 percent Latino registrants.” Given that dominance, the entrance polls cited by Sanders “do not add up,” according to the report from Latino Decisions for the Clinton campaign.
The Sanders campaign is discrediting the methodology used by Latino Decisions.
“The methodology of using heavily Latino or ‘barrio’ precincts to represent Latino voting behavior has been considered ineffective and discarded for more than 30 years due to non-barrio residential patterns common among Latino voters since the 1980’s,” said Antonio González, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute (WCVI), a nonpartisan Hispanic research and public policy organization in San Antonio.
“Simply put there is no relevant statistical inconsistency between Edison’s Entry Poll results for Latinos, Whites, and Blacks and the overall election results. Based on this fact WCVI concludes that there is no statistical basis to question the Latino vote breakdown between Secretary Clinton and Sen. Sanders.”
The Sanders campaign says its findings are consistent with Latino voter patterns in other states.
“It is not surprising that we received the support of the Latino community in Nevada, especially since the majority of those that turned out were young Latinos,” said Erika Andiola, a Sanders spokeswoman. “We have consistently seen that the under-35 age group overwhelmingly supports Sen. Sanders, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. It’s also important to remember that young Latinos live all across Nevada and not just in Clark County.”
The median age of all Latinos in Nevada is 26 years old, compared with a median age of 44 for whites and 33 for blacks, according to Census data.
Here’s what we do know: Nevada doesn’t track voter registration or results by race, so both campaigns are making claims based on their best guesses. There isn’t much evidence that Clinton won Latino voters by a landslide either.
We also know that entrance polls are notoriously unreliable. In Iowa, for example, entrance polls projected a six-point margin of victory for Clinton when in fact she squeaked by on less than 1%. The entrance poll cited in the Sanders email had a margin of error of plus or minus seven points, according to The Washington Post.
The Clinton campaign has been active in Nevada much longer than the Sanders campaign, with Clinton unveiling a glimpse into her immigration policy at a Las Vegas high school in May 2015.

656870311057575936,false,The 5 most accurate predictions from the decade-jumping adventures in #BackToTheFuture: https://t.co/m2bDjDR3Lb https://t.co/3PCeeBshZL,http://onforb.es/1LLyGOM,True,Five Things 'Back To The Future Part II' Got Right About 2015 Technology,"In 1989's Back to the Future Part II, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox ) travels to October 21, 2015, to save the fortunes of his future children. The time-traveling cinematic sequel made many assumptions about the world we live in today--and some of them were spot on.
""I always hated--and I still don't like--movies about the future,"" director Robert Zemeckis writes in a new book, ""Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History."" ""I just think they're impossible, and somebody's always keeping score.""
Indeed we are. Adobe's Digital Index (ADI) team, which tracks social listening, has been monitoring sentiments around technology mentioned in Back to the Future Part II to see whether the film's tech stood the test of time.
""We wanted to create a digital scorecard looking at the predictions they made compared to where we are now,"" said Joe Martin, analyst with Adobe Digital Index. ""This is based off 100 million social engagements related to Back to the Future and technology.""
When Back to the Future Part II premiered 26 years ago, it grossed $332 million worldwide and helped propel the trilogy to nearly a billion dollars in box office receipts. These are the five most accurate predictions from Doc Brown and Marty's decade-jumping DeLorean adventures:
1. Wearable Tech
After Marty and Doc first land their DeLorean time-traveling car in 2015, Doc glances at his watch when Marty points out that it's raining. Doc says, “Wait five more seconds,” after which the rain stops. Doc's watch-based premonition suggests screenwriter Bob Gale was anticipating the invention of wearable tech such as the Apple Watch back when Apple had only just introduced the original Macbook. ADI looked at social media mentions and found that the Apple Watch, FitBit and Google onHub have had the most social buzz in the past 60 days. We also feel pretty good about them: average sentiment for those devices is 60% joy, admiration, or anticipation.
2. Videoconferencing
In Back to the Future Part II, Marty talks to his former high-school classmate and work colleague, Needles, via videoconferencing software on a flat-screen smart TV. Gale and Zemeckis may have hit on the genesis of Skype, which was bought for $8.5 billion in 2011. Skype is now used worldwide, earning 7 million social mentions since June with the U.S., U.K., France, Brazil and Spain talking most about Skype on social media.
3. Mobile Payments

Back To The Future II's Missing Scene: 5 Things That Would Surprise Marty About Vaccines In 2015
4. Virtual Reality
Remember the scene where Marty and his sister are wearing virtual reality (VR) glasses and they're using them to answer the phone while watching TV? We may be a ways off from such ubiquitous domestic integration of VR, but with the impending release of Oculus Rift's consumer-targeted headset the future as predicted in the film could arrive sooner than we might think. The public is certainly excited: When looking at social mentions, Facebook’s Oculus VR has the most buzz in 2015's third quarter, while 47% of the chatter relates to joy, admiration and anticipation.
5. Drones
Back to the Future Part II featured drone-like technology that was used widely by news outlets including a USA Today drone that's videotaping Doc. While media companies may be toying with using drones, they aren't yet commonplace in the newsroom arsenal. Still, drones are widely talked about today, with about 3 million mentions since June. Most of the talk relates to military use, and 60% of the buzz is negative.
Technological Self-Fulfilling Prophecies From 'Back To The Future'
Though Marty and Doc got many things right--including our obsession with hoverboards--there are several things the future surprised us with. Among the gadgets Gale failed to predict: the smartphone.
""It's the Swiss Army Knife of today,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""The fact that everyone can have one device that's a computer, that's a camera, that's a recording device, that's a calculator, that's a flashlight ... we didn't think of that.""
The filmmakers also overplayed the importance of fax machines--a messaging system we have long since replaced with email. With 80% of millennials checking email on their smartphone, their future has no time for the clunky fax machine.

634404792241143809,false,New SeaWorld Show Just Elephant Drowning In Large Tank Of Water With No Explanation http://t.co/LoZz4XLFcs http://t.co/VyCKGoJ1M0,http://onion.com/1hOfvZ7,True,New SeaWorld Show Just Elephant Drowning In Large Tank Of Water With No Explanation,"ORLANDO, FL—Noting that the show had simply appeared on the park’s schedule last week without an announcement or fanfare of any kind, visitors to SeaWorld told reporters Thursday that the theme park’s latest attraction consists solely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water with no explanation.
The most recent addition to the amusement park’s slate of entertainment—listed on brochures and signs simply as “Elephant Drowning”—reportedly features an adult African elephant that is led out by trainers into the main amphitheater, where it is immediately shoved into a 36-foot-deep aquarium and left to slowly die, all without the music, lighting cues, or narration that typically accompany other SeaWorld shows.
“After they pushed it into the pool, it swam around for a little while, which was cool because I didn’t even know elephants could swim, but then it started really struggling to keep its head above water,” said visitor Katie Hayes, 32, who attended the 1 p.m. Elephant Drowning performance with her family after seeing a sign advertising the show simply as “SeaWorld’s Newest Experience.” “My kids were cheering for it at first, and we all thought it might do some tricks or something. But it just sort of thrashed around the whole time, trying to get out of there.”
“And then it drowned,” Hayes added.
“Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”
Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced, silently forced the full-grown elephant into the tank, and then walked out through the backstage door, all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way. Additionally, many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring, or at least mention the elephant’s name, but noted that no one ever did.
Over the course of the half-hour show, the 12,000-pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked, making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure. Sources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank’s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself.
“It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point, which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety, which would have been incredible—but nope,” said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern, 22, who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced, given the animal’s continuous, ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass. “Eventually, the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling, trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely.”
“I really wasn’t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule,” she added. “But, yeah, it was pretty much just an elephant drowning.”
Visitors said that following some violent, last-ditch floundering, the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed. Guests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank, where it came to rest in a heap, its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling.
“No one really told us when the show was over,” said season-pass holder Mariam O’Neill, 57. “After the elephant didn’t move for a while, people got up and started leaving. A few people stuck around for the Clyde & Seamore’s Sea Lion High show, which was coming up next.”
According to sources, the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well-attended since its introduction earlier this month, with the Saturday afternoon show in particular, which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf, regularly filling to capacity.
When reached for comment, SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park’s website.
“SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand-new attraction to its visitors,” company representative Nancy Klemmer said. “Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you’ve come to expect from SeaWorld, and it’s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages.”
“Plus, the elephants absolutely love it,” Klemmer added.",4759

Interested in Hillary Clinton? Add Hillary Clinton as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hillary Clinton news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
The documents were not among the 30,000 work-related emails turned over to the State Department by her attorneys in December 2014.
The State Department confirmed it has received ""tens of thousands"" of personal and work-related email materials — including the 14,900 emails found by the FBI — that it will review.
The number of emails provided by the FBI to the State Department for review is much higher than the ""several thousand"" that FBI Director James Comey said in July were uncovered as part of his agency's investigation.
""We found those additional emails in a variety of ways,"" Comey explained in July. ""Some had been deleted over the years, and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private e-mail domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton ... Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of email fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013.""
Meanwhile, the State Department, in response to a Freedom of Information lawsuit, released call logs of top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, whose name has been attached to efforts to get a Clinton donor placed on a government intelligence advisory board.
One of the callers, Laura Graham, the COO for the Clinton Foundation, called Mills frequently — sometimes several times a day.
“Urgent question as it relates to security and asks to speak with you bf you meet with the PM,” Graham said in a message on Feb. 8, 2012.
Regarding Mills, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, ""Again, we have seen no evidence of any behavior, any relations with the Clinton Foundation that weren't completely aboveboard, and in this case it's likely that what they were dealing with during many of these calls was the immediate aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.""
The State Department committed last week to publicly releasing the Clinton emails uncovered by the FBI as part of an existing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch.
At a status hearing Monday before U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing that case, the State Department presented a schedule for how it will release the emails found by the FBI.
The first group of 14,900 emails was ordered released, and a status hearing on Sept. 23 ""will determine the release of the new emails and documents,"" Boasberg said.
“As we have previously explained, the State Department voluntarily agreed to produce to Judicial Watch any emails sent or received by Secretary Clinton in her official capacity during her tenure as secretary of state which are contained within the material turned over by the FBI and which were not already processed for FOIA by the State Department,"" Toner said in a statement issued Monday.
""We can confirm that the FBI material includes tens of thousands of nonrecord (meaning personal) and record materials that will have to be carefully appraised at State,"" it read.
The FBI uncovered the documents as part of its investigation into Clinton's use of private email at the State Department.
""State has not yet had the opportunity to complete a review of the documents to determine whether they are agency records or if they are duplicative of documents State has already produced through the Freedom of Information Act"" said Toner, declining further comment.
""We are not sure what additional materials the Justice Department may have located, but if the State Department determines any of them to be work-related, then obviously we support those documents being released publicly as well,"" said Brian Fallon, the press secretary for the Clinton campaign.
""As we have always said, Hillary Clinton provided the State Department with all the work-related emails she had in her possession in 2014,"" he said.
At a July news conference announcing the FBI's recommendation that no criminal charges be filed against Clinton, Comey disclosed that investigators found ""several thousand work-related emails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.""
Three of those several thousand emails were classified at the time they were sent or received, he said.

US Olympic swimmer Jimmy Feigen has agreed to pay nearly $11,000 to a Brazilian charity over his involvement in a dispute about an armed robbery.
He was one of four gold medallists who hit the headlines after teammate Ryan Lochte claimed that the group had been robbed at a Rio petrol station.
CCTV footage contradicted their story, showing the swimmers had vandalised the petrol station after partying.
The United States Olympic Committee has since apologised to Brazil.
""The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members,"" a USOC statement said.
Mr Lochte left Brazil on Tuesday but Mr Feigen stayed behind and was detained.
The two other members of the group, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, were pulled off a flight in Rio on Thursday night and questioned by police.
They deny any involvement in the false robbery claim and were allowed to leave for the US on a later flight.
US cringes at Lochte's ""bro"" antics
Breno Melaragno, Feigen's lawyer, said: ""After a long deliberation, this agreement was reached… he will donate 35,000 reais ($10,800) to an institute, and with that the case is resolved.
""After this donation is done, his passport will be given back to him, and he will be free to return home.""
Mr Melaragno did not say which charity, or institute, would receive the donation.

The bizarre story began when Mr Lochte told a reporter that the four men were robbed at gunpoint by thieves disguised as police officers.
In a colourful description of the 14 August robbery, the swimming star said he refused to get on the ground despite having a gun pressed to his forehead.
But when police began to investigate, the evidence appeared to tell a different story. Rio's civilian police chief Fernando Veloso has now ruled out any possibility that the crime occurred.
""No robbery was committed against these athletes. They were not victims of the crimes they claimed,"" Mr Veloso said.
He told reporters that one or more of the athletes had instead vandalised a toilet in a petrol station and then offered to pay for the damage.

The Americans paid and left after armed security guards intervened, he said.
One guard had justifiably drawn his gun after one of the swimmers began behaving erratically, Mr Veloso added.
He warned that the swimmers, who had repeatedly changed their accounts of what happened, could ""in theory"" face charges of giving false testimony and vandalism.

But later on Thursday, the men's lawyer Sergio Riera said Mr Bentz and Mr Conger had been allowed to leave the country by a special Olympic court.
Mr Feigen ""provided a revised statement this evening (Thursday) with the hope of securing the release of his passport as soon as possible,"" said the US Olympic Committee (USOC).
The USOC statement also confirmed Mr Veloso's version of events.

""When you start working, your heart opens up."" https://t.co/AQxhGzEhHV",http://nyti.ms/1SkHy2x,True,"In India, a Small Band of Women Risk It All for a Chance to Work","Subinspector Chauhan, for his part, was not in a hurry to return to this corner of his precinct twice in the same night. He found the reports of serious injury to be dubious. Where the Nats were concerned, he reasoned, injuries could be caused by any number of things.
“These people are all drunkards,” he said. “They are so drunk that even if you push one of those guys into a drain, he will fall down. These women try to exaggerate, they say, ‘This person attacked us, that person attacked us.’”
Mr. Siddiqui, their defense lawyer, saw no need to report the incident to the magistrate who had issued the restraining order. Sometimes, he said, it is better to allow a community to settle its own differences rather than initiate a laborious investigation. Anyway, he added, the police are very busy.
“This is a country with 1.4 billion people,” he said. “The police can’t stand behind every single person.”
The women were alone. When it became clear that Geeta’s friends were securely barricaded, Dharmender gathered a few men and made his way to the other end of the village.
Coursing through him, he explained later, was a certain kind of anger that he associated with being part of a mob. He had felt it before; it is gone after 15 minutes. But for that period, anger can make ordinary men strong enough to flip over a truck. Geeta had already called the police, and Dharmender saw no further reason to avoid violence.
Geeta’s husband, Sanjay, was in his undershirt at a neighbor’s house, watching a television serial, the children asleep under mosquito nets. When he looked up he saw that the door was blocked by bodies. He recalls the sight of his niece, slumped beside a drain, crying, and a heavy blow to the back of his head, and then nothing.
Dharmender felt pity as he beat Geeta’s husband: Sanjay was a poor boy, a decent boy. It was not his fault.
“If he was a bad person, we would feel O.K. that he had gotten hurt. But he’s a good guy,” Dharmender said. But the beating was necessary, he said, with a heavy sigh. “Until someone gets hurt, people don’t learn.”
The crowd dispersed some time later, leaving Sanjay unconscious in a pool of blood, with a deep cut on his arm, a slit snaking across a cheekbone, and a red knot on his forehead. His neighbors recalled seeing him lying unconscious on a woodpile. The police, when they finally arrived, recommended that he be taken to the hospital.
Sanjay would spend five days in a hospital bed. He had always been a small and quiet man, but when he returned to the village, he was somehow smaller and quieter. He took to slipping in and out in the half-light, trying to avoid crossing paths with the men who had beaten him.
“Anyone who has beaten you in the night can do it again,” he said.
Geeta, too, had lost her swagger. When people asked about Sanjay, she told them that he had fallen off the roof. She denied that she had been trapped in the house with the other women. She was no longer eager to boast about her campaign against the village council.
“They are powerful,” she said. “They are stronger. They beat us up like dogs.”
On the day Sanjay was discharged, Roshan was lounging with his male relatives on a rope cot outside the temple. The heat was soporific, and beside them, two buffaloes nosed through a pile of dung, quietly grunting.
All told, it had been an expensive night, Roshan said. To avoid criminal charges, he had had to pay 3,000 rupees for Sanjay’s medical care and an additional 4,000 to ensure there would be no investigation. But it was worth it, they all agreed.
Even Roshan’s concession — allowing the women of the village to return to work in the factories — had turned out in his favor. Though the Nat women had headed out almost immediately, nearly all of the factories were now shuttered: China had closed its markets to Indian meat, and Brazil’s currency had declined so sharply that its meat was now cheaper than Indian buffalo.
So that was that. No one was hiring.
Roshan could not help preening a little. “See, in our community, a woman is a woman and a man is a man,” he said. “This is what it is here. Women have lower status and men have higher status.” If any more women propose to challenge that principle, he said, “we will quietly, politely tell them this is not a good thing.”
And that night, as the sun slipped down over the sugar cane, Roshan and the others laughed and laughed.",4501

Today, to honor the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service, President and Mrs. Obama participated in a community service project at Leckie Elementary School on MLK Avenue in Southwest Washington D.C., joined by their mentees in the White House Mentorship and Leadership Program, AmeriCorps members and students, parents and teachers at the school.
The President and First Lady helped construct moveable planters with grow lights, planted vegetables, and created labels to place in the planters, which will be part of a long-lasting “MLK Garden” at the school. They also assembled backpacks filled with books related to healthy eating and Dr. King's life story for all 530 Leckie students. Other students and mentees joined in physical fitness activities led by AmeriCorps members that demonstrated how play is used to help youth resolve conflicts and develop leadership skills.

Leckie Elementary is located near the Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, which houses Air Force, Navy, and Army service members, and about 30 percent of the students are from military families. Like many schools across the country, Leckie is the nerve center of community involvement. Long after the final bell rings, parents work with staff on school activities, ranging from robotics competitions to community gardens to art projects to fitness classes.
And like 10,000 other public schools across the country, Leckie is a shining example of how national service programs—combined with the buy-in of school leadership, parents, and community leaders—help students achieve their academic goals and learn lifelong skills that make them healthier.

City Year and FoodCorps AmeriCorps members have helped Leckie improve student attendance and behavior while increasing literacy skills, physical activity, and healthy eating habits. In fact, Leckie is proud to be recognized for closing the achievement gap for students of color in both math and reading for three consecutive years.
Tomorrow, as students pick up their new backpacks and walk passed the additions to the school garden, they will be inspired to become the engaged citizens that Dr. King envisioned and the President described in his final State of the Union of Address:
“We need every American to stay active in our public life -- and not just during election time -- so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. It is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far.”

672828403016429568,false,Obama Plans Executive Action On Gun Control; White House Admits It Will Not Prevent Mass Shootings https://t.co/ySFLprzAXz,http://www.infowars.com/obama-plans-executive-action-on-gun-control-white-house-admits-it-will-not-prevent-mass-shootings/,True,Obama Plans Executive Action On Gun Control; White House Admits It Will Not Prevent Mass Shootings,"President Obama has once again threatened to use executive action to ensure that background checks become mandatory on all gun sales. However, the White House has admitted such a law would have done nothing to prevent this week’s San Bernardino shooting.
As several gun control measures proposed by Democrats were shot down in the Senate yesterday, the White House continues to look to a possible executive order that would change the meaning of the existing law to force all gun sales, even private ones, to go through the background check system.
It is unclear how this would be enforced. Currently, it is estimated that upwards of 40% of guns that change hands, do so without background checks. Many are not even sales.
In addition, the majority of mass shooters in recent years all actually PASSED background checks.
The shooters at Virginia Tech, the Aurora Colorado movie theater, Fort Hood, Isla Vista, the Washington Navy Yard, the attempted mass killing at Arapahoe High School ALL passed background checks.
The shooter at Washington Navy Yard even managed to buy his firearm after the background check system was supposedly strengthened following the incident at Virgina Tech.
The BATF has determined that Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the two shooters in San Bernardino, also legally purchased two of the weapons at a gun shop in Corona. Two others were legally purchased and given to him by a friend, federal officials said Thursday.
When asked Thursday if he believed that Obama’s proposed executive action on background checks would have prevented the massacre, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said, “Of course not.”
ABC News reporter Jon Karl asked, “Did [Obama] have any indication… if Congress instituted stronger background checks, it would have prevented this incident?”
Earnest responded, “In this incident, of course not.”
“But the president is confident, and I think common-sense-thinking Americans are confident, that if there are things that Congress can do to make it harder for individuals who shouldn’t have guns from getting them, then Congress should act and pass a law accordingly, because that law can be implemented in a way that doesn’t undermine the the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans,” Earnest added.
The reporter kept on at Earnest, asking him why the White House continually says it makes sense to institute more background checks, while admitting that would do nothing to prevent mass shootings.
“The president made these comments specifically when asked about this shooting. So I’m wondering why he kind of immediate fell back to Congress needs to pass more gun legislation.” Karl stated.
“Because the president is determined to ensure that these kinds of incidents of mass shootings aren’t considered routine, and he’s determined to press Congress at every turn to take steps –” Earnest said.
“But you just acknowledged that his proposal wouldn’t have done anything to prevent this incident,” Karl replied
Earnest then again claimed ”we are talking about future incidents,” and added that there are “too many members of Congress that are terrified of the NRA.”
The reporter still didn’t let up, asking “What is the relevance to what happened in San Bernardino if the provisions you are talking about, as you acknowledged, would have done nothing to prevent this shooting? Why is it part of this discussion?”
Earnest said, “This discussion is about what we can do to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them.”
He also claimed that while it is “hypothetical,” tougher background checks “could” prevent terrorist incidents. Earnest did not expand on the point when asked how so.
While the Obama administration is seemingly hell bent on going after stricter gun control, research from Pew Research Center, the FBI, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveals that gun violence in the US is actually on the decline, and is at its lowest since the 1960s.
In addition, gun crime, despite an exponential increase in privately owned firearms over the same period, has steadily declined for about 20 years, except for high-profile shootings in gun-free zones.

649974380416618496,true,"Vatican official says there is ""a sense of regret"" that Pope Francis met with Kim Davis: http://t.co/5ZcAYUT6mL http://t.co/OWxpyi0bpY",http://reut.rs/1Lo2YJc,True,'Sense of regret' in Vatican over pope meeting with gay marriage opponent,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis’ meeting last week with an American woman at the center of a row over gay marriage was not something he had sought and should not be seen as an endorsement of her views, the Vatican said on Friday.

One Vatican official said there was “a sense of regret” that the pope had ever seen Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who went to jail in September for refusing to honor a U.S. Supreme Court ruling and issue same-sex marriage licenses.
The encounter in Washington was originally kept secret and has sparked widespread debate since it became public this week, proving something of a misstep for the pontiff.
Looking to smother the fierce controversy, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Davis was one of “several dozen” people who had been invited by the Vatican ambassador to see Francis during his visit to the U.S. capital.
“The Pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects,” Lombardi said in a statement.
“The only real audience granted by the Pope at the Nunciature (Vatican embassy) was with one of his former students and his family,” the statement said.
The Vatican later confirmed on Friday that the pope met with Yayo Grassi, a U.S.-based Argentine caterer who is gay and brought his male partner of 19 years to the meeting.
Grassi, 67, has known the pope since Francis taught him literature and psychology at a high school in Argentina in the 1960s and has stayed in touch.
“What I can say is that he met with me knowing that I am gay, and we had an extraordinary, very moving conversation,” Grassi told Reuters.
EMBASSY UNDERESTIMATED SIGNIFICANCE
The meeting with Davis disappointed many liberal Catholics but delighted conservatives, who saw it as a sign that the pope was clearly condemning a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage.
Davis said on Wednesday that the pope had thanked her for her courage and told her to “stay strong,” adding that knowing that he agreed with what she was doing “kind of validates everything.”
While Lombardi declined to take questions on the incident, his assistant, Father Tom Rosica, a Canadian priest, laid the blame on the Vatican embassy in Washington, saying it had underestimated the impact of Davis’s presence at the reception.
“I’m not sure that they (the embassy) realized how significant it would be,” he told reporters.
Rosica said he did not believe the pope was even indirectly involved in inviting Davis, adding that the greeting was very brief and that she and her husband were among the many guests at the Washington embassy before the pope left for New York.
Rosica said he did not know if there had been a private meeting. Davis’ lawyer, Mat Staver, said the couple were not in a line, that the meeting was private and seen only by Vatican personnel and security.
“Had Kim Davis been in a line of people or been seen by anyone outside of Vatican personnel, we would not have been able to keep her visit secret,” he said in a statement.
Rosica said the pope was most likely not fully aware of how controversial a figure Davis had become.
“I would simply say her case is a very complex case. It has all kinds of intricacies. Was there an opportunity to brief the pope on this beforehand? I don’t think so. Was an in-depth process done? No, probably not,” Rosica said.
Asked if the pope had been set up intentionally by someone in the embassy, Rosica said: “No, reading all of the information, listening to all of the facts, these things happen.”
Rosica said he also doubted that Davis and her husband spent 15 minutes with the pope, as her lawyer had reported, saying “there simply was not enough time”.
Davis has said her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian prevent her from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Her church belongs to a Protestant movement known as Apostolic Pentecostalism.
Rosica said he hoped the Davis incident and its aftermath would not distract from the significance of the U.S. trip.
“The visit was extraordinary ... so to allow this to kind of overshadow it would be very unfortunate. This is not the centerpiece of the papal visit. This is one small part of it, but it is a loaded centerpiece.”",4462

727116900983934976,unverified,. @target stock plunges in early days of @AmericanFamAssc boycott. https://t.co/HugeQYvFN8,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/29/one-million-americans-vow-to-boycott-target-over-transgender-bathrooms.html,True,One million Americans vow to boycott Target over transgender bathrooms,"More than one million people have decided they will no longer buy their Nutter Butters or Wet Wipes at Target.
The American Family Association launched a boycott of the nation’s second largest retailer a week ago – over Target’s corporate policy allowing men who identify as women to use the bathrooms and fitting rooms of their choosing.
Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!
“We believe that everyone – every team member, every guest, and every community – deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally,” the company wrote in a statement. “Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.”
American Family Association, one of the most prominent and respected family advocacy groups in the nation, warned that Target’s policy puts women and children in danger.
“Nearly everyone has a mother, wife, daughter or friend who is put in jeopardy by this policy,” AFA President Tim Wildmon said. “Predators and voyeurs would take advantage of the policy to prey on those who are vulnerable.”
And it’s pretty clear that more than a million customers agree with the American Family Association.
“Everybody knows it’s wrong for men to use the same bathrooms and fitting rooms with little girls,” Wildmon told me. “Target has decided they don’t care about the vast majority. They only care about the tiny, tiny minority.”
The American Family Association stressed that their boycott has nothing to do with the transgender community.
“We want to make it very clear that AFA does not believe the transgender community poses this danger to the wider public,” Wildmon said. “Rather, this misguided and reckless policy provides a possible gateway for predators who are out there.”
I’ve never been one to tell you how to spend your hard-earned money. It’s not my place. But I don’t mind telling you that the Starnes family has joined the boycott.
Granted, Target has every right to determine its corporate policies. But I also have a right to buy my Cocoa Puffs at a place that respects common sense.
For the sake of inclusivity, would Target allow a 16-year-old who identifies as a 21-year-old to purchase a six-pack of beer? Would Target provide a senior citizen discount to a 30-year-old who identifies as a 70-year-old?
Wildmon told me the Target boycott struck a nerve with a significant section of the country. Many people have grown tired of Hollywood and Big Business trying to bully and intimidate local governments.
“Corporate America must stop bullying people who disagree with the radical Left agenda to remake society into their progressive image,” he said. “This boycott is a reaction to the bullying we’ve seen in places like North Carolina and Mississippi.”
Among the most vocal supporters of AFA’s boycott is evangelical leader Franklin Graham.
“A man shouldn’t be able to enter the women’s restroom or dressing room because he says he ‘feels like a woman today,’” Graham wrote on Facebook. “That’s ridiculous. The fact is, gender identity isn’t something we choose or feel. We are the sex God created us to be – male or female. How a person feels doesn’t change the facts.”
It’s as if an anatomical fog has rolled across the fruited plain – causing befuddlement in bathroom stalls from coast to coast.
So perhaps I can provide some clarity to the Great Latrine Wars of 2016. Those of you with man-parts should use the men’s room and those of you with lady-parts should use the ladies room.
I suspect that right about now you’re probably thinking your friendly neighborhood columnist is a bit politically incorrect. Well, it’s true – I am.
When I was growing up we just had boys and girls (him and her, not ze and zir). Our bathroom choices were limited to our God-given plumbing.
So maybe Target ought to consider going old school.
It’s pretty much a fool-proof system -- unless you happen to be at Long John Silver’s – and then the men should use the buoys room and the ladies should use the gull’s room.
And no matter if you identify as a him or her or ze or zir -- be sure to courtesy flush.

Monis, who was killed during the final minutes of the siege in Sydney's CBD, was no stranger to police; with a long rap sheet including allegations of sexual abuse and organising the murder of his ex-wife.
Monis was born Manteghi Bourjerdi and fled from Iran to Australia in 1996 where he changed his name to Man Haron Monis and assumed the title of Sheik Haron.
Lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis when he was charged last year with being accessory to the murder of ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, described the self-declared sheik as a ""damaged-goods individual"".
Sheik Man Haron Monis. (AAP)
Sheik Man Haron Monis. (AAP)
""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness,"" he told the ABC. ""Knowing he was on bail for very serious offences, knowing that while he was in custody some terrible things happened to him, I thought he may consider that he's got nothing to lose.""
""Hence participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.""
The self-styled sheik was shunned by Australia's Muslim community who disputed his claims of being a Sheik, according to community leader Dr Jamal Rifi
He had gained media attention in the past for a ""hate mail"" campaign, protesting the presence of Australian troops in Afghanistan by sending abusive letters to the loved ones of dead Australian servicemen.
Late last year he was charged with being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife and mother of two.
More recently he was charged with a raft of offences in relation to indecent and sexual assault while operating as a self-proclaimed ""spiritual healer"" in Sydney's west more than a decade ago.
Mr Conditsis said Monis claimed to have been abused while in prison ""involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell"".

He added that he did not believe Monis was a member of any organised terrorist group.
""This is a one-off random individual,"" he said. ""It's not a concerted terrorism event or act.""
""It's a damaged-goods individual who's done something outrageous.""
The High Court had recently rejected Monis' latest appeal in relation to letters he had sent to the families of Australian servicemen.
The family of Brett Till, an Australian solder killed by a roadside bomb in 2009, was one of the families who received a letter from Monis and his partner Amirah Droudis.
""We sat in our homes, reading these letters ... This man accusing my husband of being a child killer,"" widow Bree Till said at the time.
9NEWS was given police clearance to release Monis' name.
In November 2009 Monis appeared in court claiming to be a peace activist but later chained himself to the courthouse in protest of charges laid against him.
Monis escaped jail time but was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and placed on a two-year good behaviour bond in September 2013.
He again received attention from police in November last year when he allegedly organised the murder of his ex-wife and mother-of-two Noleen Hayson Pal.
Ms Pal had been stabbed and her body set alight in a Werrington apartment block, allegedly by Ms Droudis.
Monis was charged with being an accessory before and after the fact to the murder while Ms Droudis was charged with murder. The couple won bail in Penrith Local Court after a magistrate noted the prosecution case was weak, News Corp reports.
In April this year he was charged with sexually assaulting seven women while working as a spiritual healer in Wentworthville, where he claimed to be an expert in ""astrology, numerology, meditation and black magic"".
In October Monis, who most recently had been living at Bexley North in Sydney's south, was charged with an extra 40 sexual offences relating to his work as a spiritual healer.
He was on bail at the time of the siege and due to appear in court over indecent and sexual assault charges in February 2015.
Earlier this month Monis announced via his website he used to be a Rafidi, one who rejects legitimate Islamic authority and leadership, but ""now I am a Muslim"".

RATING
Mixture
WHAT'S TRUE
Target confirmed a chain-wide policy allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identity.
WHAT'S FALSE
Target made the decision due to pressure placed on the chain by President Obama or LGBT groups; Target announced ""transgender restrooms.""
ORIGIN
Public debate around transgender individuals and bathroom use hit a fever pitch in April 2016, largely due to the controversial passage of HB 2 (otherwise known as the “bathroom bill“) in North Carolina. On 19 April 2016, Target released a statement confirming a new policy about transgender customers and bathrooms:
Continuing to Stand for Inclusivity Recent debate around proposed laws in several states has reignited a national conversation around inclusivity. So earlier this week, we reiterated with our team members where Target stands and how our beliefs are brought to life in how we serve our guests. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It’s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day. We believe that everyone—every team member, every guest, and every community—deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination. In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.
Bathroom controversies weren’t new in April 2016, but HB2, which was by far the highest profile legislation of that nature, provoked a huge response across the country. Target was not the first large and well-known entity to clarify its policy about transgender bathroom use, and the brand responded to some feedback on Twitter:
@Kusau Everyone is welcome at Target. ❤️ — Target (@Target) April 20, 2016
Not all of the public’s response was positive. Target’s Facebook page was flooded with critical responses similar to the (heavily satirized) comments that appeared when the chain announced gender-neutral toy aisles:
Some misinformation also circulated about the development. The web site The Political Insider reported that the retailer released the statement under pressure from the President and LGBT groups:
Target just caved to pressure from the Obama administration and liberal activists. They have announced that any “transgendered” person can use the bathroom in their stores, according to the gender they associate with. Now in Target stores, men are allowed to use the restroom next to your daughter. Once called perverted, this is now a “civil right.”
No information we could find substantiated the claim that Target was pressured to institute the chain-wide policy, and no retailers of a similar size and scope have reported any organized push to enact similar policies. While HB2 is an enforceable law, Target’s bathroom policy is simply a brand’s policy decision based on its own ethics and belief structure.
It is true that Target announced on 19 April 2016 that transgender shoppers and staffers were welcome to use the bathroom that best matched their gender identities. However, neither President Obama nor any groups appeared to have forced the retailer’s hand in issuing the policy, and no “transgender bathrooms” were included in the details of the announcement.",4327

""Then it was quiet. I looked out of the window and saw a police car and paramedics and neighbours looking along the road.""
Mrs Younger went outside and asked what had happened.
""They told me the dog had attacked the little boy and he was in a bad way.""
She said the family involved had not lived in the street for very long and ""kept themselves to themselves"".

Dexter Neal's death comes just days after a 52-year-old man was attacked and killed by a dog which had been returned to its owner despite concerns that it was dangerous.
David Ellam was out walking with his Yorkshire terrier close to his home in Huddersfield on Monday when he was attacked by another dog. He later died in hospital.
West Yorkshire Police said the animal had been seized by police following a visit by a dog warden in June, but had been returned to its owner on 8 August after it was determined that it was not a banned breed.
Pet owners convicted of dangerous dogs offences will face harsher punishments under new sentencing guidelines in England and Wales.
The guidelines, which came into force from July, reflect 2014 changes to the law that increased maximum sentences.
The Sentencing Council said sentences were ""likely to be higher than in the past"" but must be ""proportionate"".

Image caption Reggie Blacklin was bitten by a terrier
Changes to sentencing guidelines in 2014 raised the maximum jail sentence for a fatal dog attack from two years to 14.
The amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act also extended the law to include attacks which happen on private property and introduced a new offence of attacks on assistance dogs such as guide dogs.
Banned breeds are pit bull terriers, the Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Braziliero.",4325

A black man who runs from police shouldn't necessarily be considered suspicious — and merely might be trying to avoid ""the recurring indignity of being racially profiled,"" the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court says.
The court made that observation as it overturned the conviction of a man who was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit after he ran from a Boston police officer who, the court says in its ruling, ""lacked reasonable suspicion"" to try to stop him in the first place.
As member station WBUR reports, the court cited ""Boston police data and a 2014 report by the ACLU of Massachusetts that found blacks were disproportionately stopped by the city's police"" as it threw out the 2011 gun conviction of Jimmy Warren.
The court also cited ""a factual irony"" in how flight from police is viewed and said that in this instance, a Boston police officer decided to approach Warren and a companion despite important factors: The officer was looking for three, not two, suspects, and he had been given only vague descriptions that the suspects were wearing dark clothing and a hoodie.
Some 30 minutes after the crime was reported, Officer Luis Anjos was driving in his police cruiser when he spotted Warren and another man, rolled down the passenger-side window, and yelled, ""Hey guys, wait a minute.""
Rather than talk to the officer, the court said, ""the two men made eye contact with Anjos, turned around, and jogged down a path"" into a park. They were apprehended after Anjos called for assistance.
The court wrote:
""Where a suspect is under no obligation to respond to a police officer's inquiry, we are of the view that flight to avoid that contact should be given little, if any, weight as a factor probative of reasonable suspicion. Otherwise, our long-standing jurisprudence establishing the boundary between consensual and obligatory police encounters will be seriously undermined.""
Discussing how a person's race can also be a factor, the Massachusetts court said it's important to consider a recent Boston Police Department report ""documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston.""
Noting that black men were more likely to be targeted by Boston police for encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations, the judges wrote, ""We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop.""
But the judges went on to say that flight alone does not prove ""a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt.""
The targeting of black males by police for ""field interrogation and observation"" — FIO — changes the equation, the court said, and ""suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt.""
The court wrote:
""Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity. Given this reality for black males in the city of Boston, a judge should, in appropriate cases, consider the report's findings in weighing flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.""
According to WBUR, Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans was unhappy with the court's ruling, saying that the judges failed to consider the broader context and gave too much weight to the ACLU's analysis of the department.
The Boston police study says that since 2010, the force has made ""significant changes"" in the way it operates, including new training, documentation requirements, and meeting with community members and the ACLU to discuss best practices.
Some of the changes have been relatively simple, such as Evans urging officers to hand out business cards after encounters with the public. But others have been more complicated: Earlier this month, a judge sided with Evans in his dispute with the city's largest police union over the commissioner's plan to institute a police body camera program.
As The Associated Press reported, a compromise deal had called for 100 officers to volunteer to wear the cameras in a pilot program — but after no officers stepped forward, Evans issued an order requiring officers to wear them.",4321

Mayor Madeline Rogero (D) of Knoxville, Tennessee also denied the allegations.
“I’m not even sure this is worth responding to, but for the record: There is a list circulating online purporting to “out” elected officials as members of the KKK. For reasons unfathomable to me or anyone who knows me, my name is on the list. Given my background, my interracial family, my public record and my personal beliefs, this would be hilarious except that it is probably being seen by a lot of people who have no idea who I am,” Rogero wrote on Facebook.
“So, just to be clear, for anyone who doesn’t know me: Don’t be ridiculous,” the mayor continued. “I began my political career working for the rights of farm workers with Cesar Chavez. I have spent decades working for causes of social justice and equality. As Mayor, I have pushed for diversity in our workforce and outreach to and inclusion of people of all backgrounds in our community. In concert with President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper program, I began the Save Our Sons initiative to increase opportunities and reduce violence-related deaths among boys and young men of color. I have advocated publicly for LGBT civil rights, and I was the only mayor in Tennessee to sign onto the mayors’ amicus brief for the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court’s marriage equality case. In short, I don’t think the KKK would want anything to do with me.”
“I strongly request that anyone associated with the creation and dissemination of this false and defamatory accusation retract it immediately,” Rogero wrote. “It is irresponsible and slanderous. (Although, on a positive note, I do appreciate that they are using a picture of me from 12 years ago. Very flattering!)”
Ocala, Florida Mayor Kent Guinn (R) told WKMG-TV reporter Erik Sandoval he wasn’t a KKK member.
Fort Wayne, Indiana Mayor Tom Henry denied the accusations as well.
“Claims that I have ties to the KKK are totally false and irresponsible,” Henry wrote on Twitter. “Our City celebrates and appreciates diversity and acceptance. Racism has no place in our society and my life.”
Anonymous posted the names in a Pastebin account on Monday. Other politicians named by the group include Georgia Sen. Johnny Isaacson (R) and North Carolina’s Sen. Thom Tillis, a Tea Party Republican.
Twitter user Amped Attacks, who began attacking racist websites last month, took credit for posting the list, claiming he created it after hacking KKK websites.
“I worked for nine days to gather and verify all the information that was gathered before its release,” Amped Attacks told TechCrunch. “I got the information from several KKK websites when I [hacked] them and was able to dump their database. I went through many emails that was signed up with these sites and a few of the emails that sparked my interest was the ones of the politicians in question there would be no reason for them to be signed up on any KKK website unless they supported it or was involved in it.”
(Editor’s note: This article was updated to include Tom Henry’s statement. Also, Newsweek reported on Monday night that Anonymous has denied responsibility for the link published by a Twitter user identified as “Amped Attacks.” The online activist group did, however, say it would release its own list of Klan members on Thursday.)",4267
731093044460683264,unverified,Target CEO responds to nationwide boycott of the store over transgender bathroom policy https://t.co/wmxiOA5POH https://t.co/uBtayITDRI,http://wapo.st/1Ta9HIF,True,Target CEO responds to nationwide boycott of the store over transgender bathroom policy,"After Target's position on transgender customers using restrooms spurred calls for a boycott, here are just a few companies that also have strong policies protecting trans rights. (Gillian Brockell,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)
Target CEO Brian Cornell has now spoken publicly about the backlash the company experienced after releasing a statement declaring that transgender individuals shopping at the retail giant can use whichever bathroom corresponds with their gender identity. Among that backlash is an online petition by the American Family Association, a Tupelo, Miss.-based religious non-profit organization founded by First United Methodist pastor Donald E. Wildmon.
Thus far, that petition has received 1.2 million signatures. It argued that “Target’s policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims. And with Target publicly boasting that men can enter women’s bathrooms, where do you think predators are going to go?”
[‘A danger to wives and daughters’: Petition to boycott Target over transgender-inclusive bathrooms claims growing support]
Target’s original statement read, in part:
We believe that everyone — every team member, every guest, and every community — deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination. In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.
[Target: Customers welcome in fitting rooms, bathrooms corresponding with ‘gender identity’]
Cornell, appearing Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” confirmed the company would not be reversing its policy. He called to mind the civil rights movement of the 1960s by evoking Target’s past in using African American models in its advertising when it was socially unpopular to do so.
“We’ve had a long history of embracing diversity and inclusion,” Cornell said. “A couple of weeks ago, one of our team members sent me a note reminding me that if we went back to the mid-60s, our company was one of the very first to use African American models in their advertising. And back then, you know, it wasn’t well received. We had a lot of tough feedback, but sitting here today, we know we made the right decision.”
He went on to point out that many of Target’s stores have family bathrooms available to customers, and that the company will soon be expanding the option to all retail locations. He didn’t specify whether he considered these places for parents to take children or unisex bathrooms to be used by anyone.
“What’s been lost in this story is the fact that, what we also talked about, is that the vast majority of our stores — actually over 1,400 of our stores — already have a family restroom,” Cornell said. “And we’re committed over the next few months to make sure every one of our stores has that option, because we want our guests to be welcomed in our stores.”
He concluded by stating that safety remains a top priority for the company. The comment seemed to be in direct response to the AFA’s petition, which stated, “Clearly, Target’s dangerous new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters.”
“We took a stance, and we’re going to continue to embrace our belief of diversity and inclusion, just how important that is to our company, but we’re also going to make sure our focus on safety is unwavering,” Cornell said.
In a statement on its website, the AFA claimed one of its members met with Target executives on Wednesday, asking them to create a unisex bathroom “for the trans community and for those who simply like using the bathroom alone.”
“Target representatives were gracious and respectful, but sadly, they rejected our offer,” the statement read.
The AFA is also asking for a “tax-deductible” donation of $5 to reach those “who have not heard about the boycott” in an attempt to gain two million signatures. The statement contains a claim that one anonymous donor gave the association $50,000.",4245

""We were surrounded by an endless layer of garbage,"" sad Serena Cunsolo, an Italian marine biologist who works for The Ocean Cleanup. ""It was devastating to see.""
Cunsolo, 28, was one of a team of 15 researchers and volunteers aboard the Ocean Starr who a month ago set out from San Francisco to study the plastic waste as part of the ""Mega Expedition,"" a major step in the organization's effort to eventually clean up what's known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
The 171-foot mother ship returned on Sunday to San Francisco, carrying massive white bags filled with plastic garbage along with two sailing boats with volunteers who helped collect the garbage samples.
Boyan Slat, a Dutch entrepreneur and inventor, is the brains behind The Ocean Cleanup and the 'Mega Expedition' that returned to San Francisco with data from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. (The Ocean Cleanup via AP) Most of the trash they found, including a one-tonne fishing net, is medium to large-sized pieces,rather than the confetti-like plastic shards that are often ingested by fish and birds, said Boyan Slat, who founded The Ocean Cleanup and has developed a technology that he says can start removing the garbage by 2020.
""It was a good illustration of why it is such an urgent thing to clean up because if we don't clean it up soon then we'll give the big plastic time to break into smaller and smaller pieces,"" Slat said. The minuscule particles can easily enter the food chain after being eaten by small fish and birds and are extremely difficult to clean up, he said.
Tonnes of plastic
Volunteer crews on 30 boats have been measuring the size and mapping the location of tonnes of plastic waste floating between the West Coast and Hawaii that according to some estimates covers an area twice the size of Texas.
Slat said the group will publish a report of its findings by mid-2016 and after that they hope to test out a 1.6-kilometre barrier to collect garbage near Japan. The ultimate goal is construction of a 100-kilometre barrier in the middle of the Pacific.
The expedition was sponsored by The Ocean Cleanup, an organization founded by Slat, a 21-year-old innovator from the Netherlands who has envisioned using long-distance floating barriers that will attach to the seabed and target swirling ocean currents full of waste and skim garbage from the surface while aquatic life and the currents themselves pass underneath.
He became passionate about cleaning the oceans of plastic while diving in the Mediterranean Sea five years ago. ""I was diving in Greece and realized that there were more plastic bags than fish, and I wondered why can't we clean this up,"" Slat said.
Innovative solution
After dropping out of university after his first six months, Slat dedicated his life to developing the technology the group will start testing next year.
After a 2012 Ted Talk about his idea was viewed more than two million times, Slat decided to launch a kick-starter campaign and raised two million euros (about $2.27 million US) that helped to launch his organization. Soon, his innovative solution got the attention of major philanthropists in Europe and Silicon Valley, including Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, who are helping pay for the data-gathering efforts and the technology's development.
The Pacific expedition, which will end in mid-September, will gather data that will be more extensive than what has been collected in the past 40 years. It also will give a better estimate of how much plastic waste is in the Pacific Ocean, Slat said.
The boaters are using GPS and a smartphone app to search for and record the plastic. They take samples and ship them to the Netherlands, where the plastics are counted and recorded.
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch was discovered by Charles J. Moore in 1997 as he returned home from the Transpacific Yacht Race, which starts in Los Angeles and ends in Honolulu.",4228

The city of Ottawa is on lockdown as police try to locate culprits.
UPDATE:Ottawa gunman ‘identified’ as recent Muslim convert, high-risk traveler
-1 soldier dead, at least 2 other people injured -1 gunman shot and killed by police -At least 2 separate shooting sites -At least one gunman possibly still at large
""Incidents occurred at National War Memorial, near the Rideau Centre and Parliament Hill this morning,"" Ottawa Police said on their Twitter feed. Later police retracted their statement about a third shooting incident near the Rideau Centre shopping mall.The shootings began just before 10am on Wednesday when a soldier was wounded in the war memorial shooting.
One CAF solider has been killed, reported Conservative MP John Williamson. He was a reservist serving in Hamilton from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, reported the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Government Caucus received confirmation shortly ago that one CAF soldier was killed. A moment of silence followed. — John Williamson (@JohnW_MP) October 22, 2014
Several shots rang through Parliament Hill, prompting concern over the ease with which the gunman apparently accessed the site.
“So I’m locked down in Center Block on Parliament Hill after at least one shooter burst in and opened fire,” local reporter Josh Wingrove stated. “I heard dozens of gunshots and the smell of gunpowder is heavy in the hallways right now.”
Williamson made a sombre statement amid the chaos:
Parliament Hill is never going to be the same. — John Williamson (@JohnW_MP) October 22, 2014
""PM was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,"" Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement told Reuters.
Wingrove also reported seeing a motionless body inside the parliament building, which he could not confirm to be either dead or alive. Dozens of shots were fired throughout the building. The gunman was subsequently chased by police into its center block.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper managed to exit the building safely. Ottawa Hospital received three patients - two of whom had non-life-threatening injuries, according to a hospital statement seen by Reuters.
Canadian Armed Forces bases across the country are in lockdown and all Ottawa Police stations are currently closed to the public as gunmen remain at large. One shooter has been confirmed dead, according to senior CBC news reporter Aaron Saltzman.
Canadian police are investigating Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as possible suspect in Ottawa shooting, Reuters reports citing a source familiar with matter.
Ottawa police said they believe that two or three gunmen might have been involved in the incident.
Associated Press Television News journalist Jorge Barrera reported that police are in possession of a photograph of one of the gunmen, who reportedly has dark skin and long black hair. Barrera also tweeted that police have the suspect’s cellphone.
All three locations are within a few hundred meters of one another.

688366079396163584,non-rumor,Iran announces that Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and three Iranian Americans have been freed from prison https://t.co/vQ3w28vFo6,http://bbc.in/1Zro1Mc,True,Jason Rezaian and three other US prisoners leave Iran,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC News looks at what led to Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian's captivity
Three released Iranian-American prisoners, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, have left Iran after being freed on Saturday.
Rezaian, 39, was jailed on charges, including espionage, last November.
The United States said it was offering clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violation.
On Saturday evening, after talks in Vienna, international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of the nuclear deal agreed last year.
The lifting of the sanctions was announced by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.
Three of the US citizens - Rezaian, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati - were released from prison on Saturday and were flown to Switzerland then to Germany on Sunday. They were expected to receive medical treatment at a US base there.
A fourth, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, did not fly with them, US officials said.
US citizens released by Iran
The four prisoners are all dual US-Iran citizens.
Jason Rezaian: aged 39, Tehran correspondent for the Washington Post. Detained in Iran for more than a year before his sentencing last November.
Saeed Abedini: aged 35, a Christian pastor who had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organising churches in people's houses.
Amir Hekmati: aged 32, former Marine who spent more than four years in prison on spying charges following his arrest in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother.
Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari: Little is known about the fourth US citizen.
Iranian citizens released by the US
Of the seven Iranian citizens being released, six are also citizens of the US. The Iranian state news agency listed them as: Nader Modanlo, Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghani, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun.
They are all accused or convicted of violating US sanctions on Iran.
A US official said a diplomatic channel was established ""with the focus of getting our detained US citizens home"".
""Iran has also committed to continue co-operating with the United States to determine the whereabouts of Robert Levinson,"" the official said.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Mr Levinson is a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007 while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence mission.
A further 14 Iranians sought by the US would be removed from an Interpol wanted list, the US and Iran said.
A fifth American, writer and student Matthew Trevithick, was also released from jail in Iran on Saturday, but his release was not part of the prisoner exchange.
His family said in a statement published on the Iran Primer website that he had been held at Evin prison in Tehran for 40 days. He had been studying languages in Iran, they said.
Analysis: Sebastian Usher, Middle East Editor, BBC World Service
For months after his arrest in 2014, there was uncertainty over what accusations Jason Rezaian was facing. He was held in the notorious Evin prison before finally being found guilty on charges that his lawyer said included espionage.
His newspaper vigorously denied this. President Barack Obama said he would not rest until he was freed. Now, his release has been announced in what Iran calls a prisoner swap - an indication he might have been used as a bargaining chip.
His release removes a shadow that had lain over relations between Tehran and Washington even as they were thawing with the nuclear deal.
Jason Rezaian - Now a free man
The media freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders welcomed Rezaian's release, saying he ""was just doing his job as a reporter and was unlucky enough to have dual US and Iranian nationality at a time when the two countries were conducting tense negotiations about Iran's nuclear programme"".
""We are thrilled to see Jason finally free, but he should have never been imprisoned in the first place. Jason was innocent. It is outrageous that he has been used as a bargaining chip,"" said Christophe Deloire, the organisation's secretary general.",4146
656825206045020160,false,"#BackToTheFuture fans, it's October 21, 2015 — the future is finally here! https://t.co/hvDzzGbCmH https://t.co/lJtrchJrAn",http://cbsn.ws/1W45qUO,True,"What ""Back to the Future II"" got right about the future","October 21, 2015 marks an exciting day in cinematic history -- the future is finally here.
In the sequel to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel thirty years into the future, to this very date in their DeLorean time machine. In the real 20-teens, it's all about self-driving cars, but many of the film's other predictions for the future have finally become present, reports Vladimir Duthiers of CBS News's digital network CBSN.
Screenwriter Bob Gale had a clear vision for the future. Inside the Cooper Union Clock Tower, Gale told us he wanted 2015 to be recognizable.
""We knew going in nobody successfully predicts the future accurately, can't be done,"" said Gale. ""We want the future to be a positive, optimistic future. We want people to see this movie and say, 'Hey I like that future, I'd like to live there.'""
In the film, a gang chased Marty around town in 2015, each flying on their own personalized hoverboard. Visual effects art director John Bell designed many of the movie's futuristic elements, including hoverboards and the nostalgic Café 80s.
""All we know is we go thirty years in the future and there's something called the hoverboard,"" said Bell. ""I'll take something that's 85 percent familiar -- it could be a shape, it could be a color, it could be a pattern -- and then if I'm projecting the future, throw something that's just a little 15 percent twist.""
Today, companies are still testing how to make a reliable, working hoverboard for the general public. On the real streets of 2015, toys like swagways are the closest we've gotten to gliding around.
""There were a lot of old predictions that we made where maybe that'll come true, that has a good chance. Hoverboards? We never thought that,"" said Gale. ""They say life imitates art...so kids like you saw ""Back to the Future part 2"" back in the day and said well, if I can't have a hoverboard...I'm going to make one.""
Even the movie's fantasy about drones have made it to reality.
""They're being used by everybody, they're all over the place,"" said Bell. ""We started out thinking this was this gag technology, its just a joke. Little did we know people are using them all over the world.
""We're not thinking about 'we're making it an important statement about the future here"" - No, no, no, no -- we're having a good time,"" said Gale.
While nobody uses fax machines anymore for instant communication as in the movie, it nails other everyday technology--like finger print scanners, which unlock the front door and pay for things like taxis in the film. Today we use biometric technology to open doors, unlock smartphones and even authorize digital payments.
The McFlys also use a giant flat screen TV that responds to audio commands and makes video calls. Flat screens have been around for a while now, but Samsung's Smart-TV now even has a voice recognition.
As for video calls, there's Facetime and Skype. Duthiers spoke to Executive West Coast Editor of Vanity Fair, Krista Smith via Skype.
""I think [the movie] still holds up, absolutely...the stuff that they were talking about in 85 to 90 is stuff that's actually a reality now,"" said Smith. ""As a teenager it's still very relevant...because you're still going through the same things. It doesn't matter if you have an iPhone or if you can fly around the world -- 15-year-olds are feeling the same thing 15-year-olds were feeling in the 50s.
If we wait just a bit longer, we will see whether the movie's ultimate prediction will come true -- whether the Cubs will win the World Series, marking the first time in 107 years since the Cubs won their last World Series title.
Three decades later, ""Back to the Future II"" still has a lasting impact and resonates with viewers, which Gale attributes to the ""humanity"" in the film.
""The movie says you have some control over your own destiny, the things that you do today can have a life changing effect in your future...,"" says Gale.
To celebrate the movies, a 30th anniversary DVD is out, and the trilogy is being re-released in select theaters nationwide.",4080

The hostages were being held in the Lindt Chocolat Café, a chocolate shop and cafe in Sydney's Martin Place, the city's financial district where the Reserve Bank of Australia and several commercial banks have their main offices. The area is also close to the New South Wales state parliament.
New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn confirmed that three people had gotten away.
""The first thing we will do is make sure they are OK and then we will work with these people to find out some more information,” Burn said. “Our No. 1 aim is to resolve this incident peacefully.""
Police negotiators are in contact with the armed hostage-taker, but the motive remains unclear, Burn said.
Earlier in the day, video emerged showing people being held inside the shop with their hands held in the air. Two women were also seen inside the cafe holding up what appeared to be a black flag with white Arabic writing on it.
New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said there is at least one armed person holding an undisclosed number of hostages in the cafe. Police have not yet had contact with the hostage taker, he said, adding that the situation began Monday at 9:45 a.m. local time.
In a statement on Facebook, Lindt said, ""We would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and kind support over the current situation at the Lindt Chocolate Café at Martin Place. We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families.

Several nearby offices were evacuated as a precaution, police said. People in buildings in the neighboring streets were directed to remain indoors and stay away from open windows.
""There's a real sense of alertness, awareness, and a bit of shock to be honest,"" said Lisa Martin, who works in an office nearby the cafe and was in lockdown.
""To know that there are so many people just having coffee and a chocolate are now in a hostage situation is really sobering.""

Earlier, video that aired on Channel 9 Australia showed police with weapons drawn, their attention focused on the cafe. Police said emergency services had responded and streets around the area had been closed.
""New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police are currently responding to a reported hostage-taking incident in Martin Place in Sydney,"" Abbott said.
He said the National Security Committee of Cabinet has convened for briefings on the situation.

And some people couldn’t help but turn to Twitter, wondering if there would ever be a Steve Jobs or Apple if the most restrictive ""keep-them-out"" policies were in place.
“Those who propose sweeping bans on refugees might want to consider this: Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant,” tweeted The Nation writer John Nichols @NicholsUprising.
""Worthy reminder: Steve Jobs biological father was also a #SyrianRefugee,"" tweeted Hanna Norberg, a Swedish trade economist.
Steve Jobs’ biological father, Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, was born in 1931 to a prominent Syrian family, the youngest of nine children. He grew up in Homs, Syria, a city since ravaged by the nation’s civil war.
According to the authorized Steve Jobs biography written by Walter Isaacson, in the early 1950s, Jandali went to study at the American University in Beirut, and eventually on to the University of Wisconsin.
While serving in Wisconsin as a teaching assistant, he met the woman who would become Steve Jobs’ biological mother, Joanne Schieble.
Jandali and Schieble would eventually marry, but not until they put the future co-founder of Apple up for adoption, the year he was born, in 1955. The couple later had a daughter as well, the writer Mona Simpson.
In the Jobs biography, Isaacson writes that they initially decided not to get married because Schieble’s father, who was dying at the time, “threatened to disown her if she wed Abdulfattah.”
Years later, Jobs would “bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his `adoptive’ parents or implied that they were not his `real’ parents,” Isaacson wrote. Jobs, who died in 2011, instead referred to his biological parents as “my sperm and egg bank.”
Jandali ended up in Nevada, working in the restaurant business. That's where he apparently met his son by happenstance, though he didn't know it at the time.
Jobs told Issacson that he didn’t have any interest in meeting his biological father, though Simpson eventually tracked him down. And one of the most fascinating reveals in the Isaacson book comes in an episode in where Jandali tells Simpson that “he wished she could have seen him when he was managing a Mediterranean restaurant north of San Jose. `That was a wonderful place,’ he said. “All of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs.’ “
Isaacson writes that Steve Jobs did maintain a friendly relationship with his biological mother, who after divorcing Jandali remarried for a short time to ice skating instructor George Simpson.
And Jandali, who is still living, has been married four times.
In a 2011 interview published by the Lebanese site, Ya Libnan, Jandali talked about his kids. “Steve is my biological son, but I didn’t bring him up, and he has a family that adopted him. So if it’s said that I’m the ‘father of invention’, then that’s because my biological son is a genius and my daughter a brilliant writer. I thank God for my success in life, but I’m no inventor….I’m proud of my son and his accomplishments, and of my work. Of course I made mistakes, and if I could go back in time I would have put some things right. I would have been closer to my son, but all’s well that ends well. Steve Jobs is one of the most successful people in America, and Mona is a successful academic and novelist.”

Don't expect to see a Dark Supercouple anytime soon.
On Sunday's Once Upon a Time winter finale (8/7c, ABC), Dark Swan Emma (Jennifer Morrison) will once again try to reason with her boyfriend, whom she had to turn into Dark Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) in order to save his life. ""Hook is so angry with her for doing the one thing he asked her not to do, turning him dark, when he knew he would have no power over it,"" O'Donoghue tells TVGuide.com. ""He's like a really pissed off-boyfriend.""
That said, Hook's feelings for Emma make the situation complicated. The actor says, ""You'll get to see some of that in this week's episode. You see with Rumplestiltskin and Belle and even with how Emma is with Hook, they still can love even within that darkness.""
Unfortunately, no one can hurt us as well as our loved ones. They know your weaknesses, what matters to you the most, and unfortunately, the episode description promises, ""Hook's actions will devastate Emma in a way no one saw coming."" Just great.
Once Upon a Time casts Greg Germann for a devilishly mysterious role
Check out the rest of our interview with O'Donoghue and watch the sneak peek of Hook confronting Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) at the end:
Hook left Excalibur behind on the ship where he dueled Rumple. Will we see Excalibur come back to haunt him?
Colin O'Donoghue: Excalibur is the only thing that can kill him. He left it behind. That's a very dangerous thing to happen. Excalibur is definitely something that Hook is aware of and it plays a bit of a part in the episode.
Opening a portal to the Underworld doesn't sound too safe. What sort of fallout can we expect from opening the portal?
O'Donoghue: You saw that the object was to bring back all the Dark Ones into the real world. Hook knows that the darkness is using him to get what it wants. As long as he gets his revenge on Rumplestiltskin, he doesn't mind that he's being used. And he might be blinded by that darkness, if you know what I mean. He essentially doesn't have control over it.
It seemed that his revenge against Rumple was to kill him, but now it involves the past Dark Ones?
O'Donoghue: They want to open a portal to the Underworld essentially and banish people there, which eventually — I can't reveal too much in talking about it because it's part of the second half of the season, but it's worse than death.
The dog days are over! Cruella de Vil is returning to Once
Fans are loving Dark Hook! What do you think the appeal is?
O'Donoghue: I guess it's similar to who Hook was when he first came on to the show. [Dark Hook] is slightly more manic and a little bit crazier and darker. Sometimes people like the bad boy. He's fun though for me to play. Maybe people are enjoying that side of him when we've had so much of the last season or so when he was trying to become a good person. It's always interesting to see somebody struggling with two different sides of their personality.
It was also hilarious to see Dark Hook impersonate Rumplestiltskin.
O'Donoghue: Yeah, what happened was that when I read that scene, I remember thinking that that was one of the first things that Rumple says to Hook. I know it was like my first time on the show, and so I thought it would be funny to try and do it exactly like he did. It was also a good jab at Rumple, who is no longer dark. The thing is that once you taste that darkness, it's hard not to want it.
Hook has magic now. Will we see him perform more magic?
O'Donoghue: Yes, you'll see a little bit more magic, not a huge amount. A few more with the red smoke, which is nice ode to the Disney Hook.
How prepared are our heroes in Storybrooke for what's coming?
O'Donoghue: I mean, how can you ever be prepared for all the most evil people in history coming back to Storybrooke? They're as prepared as ever. But then they've fought snow monsters and wraiths, so it's safe to say that they shouldn't be surprised by anything.

Together, we must rid our society of the injustice that is pay discrimination and restore the promise that is the right of every American: the idea that with hard work, anyone can reach for their dreams and know no limits but the scope of their aspirations. President Obama
Today -- April 12 -- is Equal Pay Day. What does that mean exactly?
In the U.S., the typical woman who is working full-time still earns just $0.79 for every 41 a man earns. That gender pay gap is even larger for women of color, and can result in the loss of hundred of thousands of dollars over a woman's lifetime.
In short, this is less a day to celebrate and more a day to recognize that work remains to make equality a reality for millions of women across the country.
Since taking office, President Obama has made equal pay a top priority. Here's a few of the steps he's taken to make progress on that goal:
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed on January 29, 2009, is the very first piece of legislation that President Obama signed into law. The law, named after a woman who discovered her employer was paying less than men doing the same job, makes it easier for women to effectively challenge unequal pay. The law amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that unfair pay complaints can be filed within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck -- and that 180 days resets after each paycheck.
The National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force
In his first official State of the Union Address, President Obama pledged to crack down on violations of equal pay laws. So he created the National Equal Pay Task Force that year to bring together the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management to help understand the full scope of the wage gap, to enforce laws already prohibiting pay discrimination, and ensure the employees and employers are educated on their rights and obligations with respect to wage discrimination.
You can read the Task Force's full report here.
An Equal Pay Executive Order
In 2014, President Obama used his own executive authority to prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation. It provides a critical tool encourage pay transparency, so workers have a potential way of discovering violations of equal pay laws and are able to seek the appropriate remedies.
Building the Data on Equal Pay
The Obama administration is working to annually collect summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from businesses with 100 or more employees. This step will cover 63 million employees and help focus public enforcement of our equal pay laws and provide better insight into discriminatory pay practices across industries and professions.
The Paycheck Fairness Act
The President has taken a number of steps within his power to help narrow the wage gap between men and women in this country -- but he cannot accomplish this alone. That's why he's calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act -- commonsense legislation that updates the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to give women additional tools to fight pay discrimination.
When President John F. Kennedy signed the original Equal Pay Act into law, women were paid 59 cents for every dollar paid to men. After more than 50 years, that gap has narrowed to 79 cents. We need to close this gap for good. As President Obama said in a State of the Union Address,
It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode. This year, let’s all come together – Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall to Main Street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves. Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds.

Courtesy Nine News
LIVE: AT least two people have been killed — including gunman Man Haron Monis — in the Martin Place cafe siege after heavily armed police stormed the location.
As a result, the siege at the Lindt cafe in the centre of Sydney’s CBD is over.
A man was seen running with his hands up before as many as 15 hostages followed running from the cafe just after 2am. A short burst of gunfire and flash grenades were heard as police stormed the building before police declared the siege over at around 2.45am.
At least four hostages are believed to have been injured, perhaps three critically, as hostages fled the cafe and police stormed the building just after 2am.
Reports are emerging a third person may have died possibly suffering a heart attack after the siege.
Two of those required CPR at the scene and a woman in her 40s has reportedly been transported to hospital and is being treated for gunshot wounds.
One of those injured is believed to be a place officer who was seen with an amount of blood streaming from his head, Sky News reports.
Authorities are currently attempting to assess the damage and arrange urgent medical attention for the hostages and police.
It is believed the area has now been cleared for risk of explosives.
Shortly before 2.45am (AEDT), police confirmed the siege was over.
Sydney siege is over. More details to follow. — NSW Police (@nswpolice) December 15, 2014
Hostages fled from the Sydney cafe where a gunman had been holding an unknown number of people for more than 16 hours just after 2am.
Television footage initially showed a man running from the eatery with his arms raised, shortly after 2am (AEDT), before being patted down by police and escorted to safety.
Minutes later, two more men and two women raced outside and were directed away by police.
Their escape was followed by 10 seconds of rapid gunfire as heavily-armed police stormed the cafe in numbers, managing to release others.
A woman, apparently middle-aged, was carried from the scene injured.
A second volley of shots erupted before the cafe filled with police and paramedics.
A number of stretchers were wheeled into the building, however, it was unclear how many people may have been injured.
According to unconfirmed reports aired by Sky News, at least four people were injured.
There was no word on the fate of the gunman, earlier identified as 50-year-old self-styled sheik Man Haron Monis.
Meanwhile, a bomb disposal robot was sent into the cafe by police.
Monis was known to police and as a self-styled preacher of Islamic State on bail for accessory to murder, as the gunman who was holding 15 terrified hostages in Sydney’s Lindt cafe.
Haron was also charged this year with indecent and sexual assault of women in 2002. Monis was hit with an additional 40 charges in October.
The 49-year-old, originally from Iran who lived in southwest Sydney, had previously sent offensive letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers, calling them ‘murderers’, The Daily Telegraph says.
He had a sawn-off shotgun and was a fringe Islamist, The Australian and Sky News reports.

As the siege exploded in Sydney’s Lindt Cafe, the world watched.
In the United States, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and other 24-hour news channels had already dedicated most of their Monday morning programming to coverage of the emergency.
When the situation climaxed with hostages fleeing and heavily armed authorities storming the cafe in Sydney’s central business district, people around the world watched live.
CNN switched programming to the Seven Network’s coverage, while FOX News switched to Australia’s Sky News.
The New York Times, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, the UK’s Independent and Times, France’s Le Monde and other news websites also were dominated by the harrowing photos of hostages running for their lives.

As verified by multiple eyewitness reports from supermarkets across the Northampton area, the real estate agent and mother of three is capable of scanning the contents of any low-income person’s basket and rapidly identifying those items which people like that don’t need to be buying, based on the products’ nutrition and cost. Additionally, Gaither, 48, is widely regarded as a leading expert in determining which groceries they would purchase instead if they had any common sense or restraint.
“There’s no reason she should be loading up on those pricey TV dinners if she’s getting the government to pay for it,” Gaither told reporters at a local Super Stop and Shop, training her prodigious faculties on a welfare recipient using a benefit card in front of her in the checkout line. “If I were on food stamps, I’d just buy two whole chickens and a bag of potatoes—you could feed a family for a week on that and still have money left over.”
“All that junk she’s buying is just loaded with sugar, too,” said Gaither, identifying with uncanny speed another critical flaw in her fellow shopper’s grocery selection. “No wonder her kids are acting out like that.”
Sources said that Gaither, in addition to being a noted scholar of how the indigent squander her tax dollars at the supermarket, is able to detect with astonishing frequency instances in which poor people claim they are unable to pay their own grocery bills yet, seconds later, pull out a brand-new cell phone that’s far nicer than the one Gaither herself owns. Moreover, as one of the most respected voices concerning the poor’s flawed eating habits, Gaither reportedly possesses the ability to instantly assess when people on public assistance keep coming back to the same fatty foods that pretty much explain how they came to look like that in the first place.
Despite her stature, Gaither has never shared her insights with any of these individuals, sources confirmed.
“The other day, I saw a woman who bought a box of name-brand Frosted Flakes because, apparently, the generic kind wasn’t fancy enough for her,” said Gaither, swiftly and decisively calculating that bagged cereal would have cost half as much. “And guess who’s going to be paying the difference in the end?”
“But then again, what do you expect?” Gaither added, making eye contact with the reporter.
As noted by her acquaintances, Gaither’s unrivaled expertise extends far beyond her appraisal of poor people’s shopping lists. Indeed, sources confirmed that she is also nothing short of a savant on such matters as whether young children should be given electronic gizmos to play with instead of a book, what homeless individuals are doing with the spare change you give them, and what on earth would motivate someone to go out in public like that.
Additionally, Gaither has earned wide commendation for putting forth a clear, straightforward solution to the behavioral problems she has identified as plaguing the poor population, suggesting simply that needy families stop popping out babies and focus on raising the ones they already have.
“No matter where you go, it always seems like Carol has some amazing new piece of insight about people around her,” said friend Gloria Ferris, who told reporters that she has often marveled at Gaither’s abilities on trips to the mall, the movies, and especially in restaurants. “Whether she’s analyzing exactly how a parent should go about disciplining their child or methodically dissecting the laziness of obese people who ride around in motorized carts, Carol’s on top of it. She just has a gift.”
“If only these people could be as perceptive as she is,” Ferris added.",4004

In an online posting, the group said they would be posting a ""tweetstorm"" on Wednesday and would then release the names of the alleged Klansmen the next day.
The release coincides with Anonymous' planned Million Mask March, an annual event held on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day).
Ahead of the planned release, one Twitter account long associated with the collective shared what it said was several data dumps containing the phone numbers and email addresses of alleged KKK members. One named several U.S. senators and mayors. The account said the information was ""found on KKK website databases.""

It wasn't immediately clear who was behind the documents. A member of Anonymous' ""Hoods Off"" team told Mashable that the list was not part of their efforts. A Twitter account associated with that group said it hadn't released any information, and it believe in ""due diligence and will NOT recklessly involve innocent individuals.""

Still, some of the politicians named in the initial documents took to social media to deny their involvement with the KKK, including Jim Gray, Mayor of Lexington, Kentucky, and Madeline Rogero, mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee.

Meanwhile, one mayor who is facing heat over KKK affiliations is Theresa Sharp in Lahoma, Oklahoma.
Sharp's husband was captured on camera in what resembled a KKK robe, alongside others, in what is being dismissed as a ""Halloween prank.""
The incident gained traction when the photo made its way onto social media.

Mayor Sharp apologized and told News 9 how the photo came to be: ""Sit around the bonfire and drink a couple of beers and thought well my buddy his last name is White and the subject got brung (sic) up. We just thought it'd be something to do and it's not something to do. I am embarrassed. I've shamed my family and friends and I apologize for that.""
She added, ""I just don't condone it regardless of who it is... It's not anything that I think needs to be represented for our community at all.""
In its press release announcing the forthcoming leaks, the group said it wasn't ""oppressing"" the Ku Klux Klan nor stripping its members of freedom of speech. ""You are legally free to live and be any which way you choose to live and be. Keep in mind, it is not illegal nor oppressive to hurt your feelings,"" the release said. ""With that said, we are stripping you of your anonymity. This is not a threat, but rather a promise.""",3977

Shareholders took a deep breath when Apple released its quarterly financial report Tuesday. IPhone sales rose last quarter, as did profits and overall sales. Sales in China were also strong.
But the iPhone's growth has slowed dramatically. The strong dollar is hurting Apple too: the iPhone is now too expensive for many potential Chinese customers.
Apple said it was a rough time to have two-thirds of its sales come from outside the United States.
""The challenging global macroeconomic environment is leading to constrained conditions unlike anything we've seen, everywhere we look,"" CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts.
And even though Apple (AAPL) managed to beat its record quarter from a year earlier, Apple said it believes sales in the current quarter will fall for the first time in 13 years.
Shares fell 3% in after-hours trading.
Here's how Apple's past quarter stacked up against the previous year.
iPhone
Final quarter of 2014: 74.5 million iPhones sold
Final quarter of 2015: 74.8 million, up less than 1%.
Apple posted record iPhone sales in the last quarter -- barely.
Demand for the latest iPhone isn't quite as strong as many had hoped. Cook said about 60% of iPhone customers haven't yet upgraded to the iPhone 6 or 6S (or the 6 Plus or 6S Plus).
Yet Cook vigorously defended the iPhone, noting that Apple sold 34,000 iPhones an hour last quarter. That ""speaks to the immense popularity of the iPhone,"" he said.
He also noted that people are currently using more than 1 billion Apple devices worldwide.
iPad
2014: 21.4 million iPads sold
2015: 16.1 million, down 25%
IPad sales have fallen for eight straight quarters.
Mac
2014: 5.5 million Macs sold
2015: 5.3 million, down 4%
Wall Street analysts were expecting Apple to sell a record 6 million Macs. PC sales fell broadly last quarter, but Apple had been bucking the overall trend
Profit
2014: $18 billion
2015: $18.4 billion, up 2%
Apple's quarterly profit was better than expected and the most profitable quarter in corporate history.
Sales
2014: $74.6 billion
2015: $75.9 billion, up 2%
Sales were also a quarterly record for Apple. In 2014, Apple ranked No. 5 on the Fortune 500 list of companies with the most revenue.
Apple figures that if global currencies hadn't plunged against the dollar, Apple would have posted more than $80 billion in sales, growing 8% from the previous quarter.
China sales
2014: $16.1 billion, making up 22% of Apple's total sales
2015: $18.4 billion, up 14%, making up 24% of Apple's total sales
China is still growing, just not as strongly as it had been. Sales in China nearly doubled a year earlier.
This quarter's sales
First quarter of 2015: $58 billion
First quarter of 2016: $50 billion to $53 billion
The last time Apple's sales fell year over year was March 2003. As much as investors were concerned about what Apple will say about the past quarter, many are even more focused on the current quarter.
Cook said he expects iPhone sales will fall for the first time in history this quarter.
Apple suppliers have been cutting production of iPhone components left and right, citing weaker demand. Cook chalked it up to a really great quarter a year earlier, leading to a difficult comparison, on top of a ""dramatically different"" economic environment now versus 2015.
Cash

Despite the simple explanation, the latest sightings have got conspiracy theorists excited.
YouTube channel Paranormal Crucible said in a video report: 'The footage captured by a local resident appears to show a huge city floating in the clouds
'The apparition, which was witnessed by hundreds of shocked residents, only lasted a few minutes before completely disappearing.'
The channel speculated it could be 'the result of a project blue beam test.'
Project Blue Beam is a conspiracy theory which claims Nasa will someday simulate an alien invasion of Earth or second coming of Christ through holograms.
Serge Monast, a conspiracist from Quebecois, first predicted in the 1980s it would happen by 1983, 1996 and then 2000.
One online poster noted: 'Notice the group of buildings is repeated three times? If it isn't someone making it on their computer, it seriously could be project blue beam.'
The Paranormal Crucible video added: 'But added: 'Or a temporal vortex, a possible parallel universe material briefly into our own reality.'
'It is also possible, considering China's technological achievements that a top secret holographic technology was tested over a heavily populated area in an effort to gauge the public reaction.'
A similar phantom city was seen over China in 2011. The phenomenon is a relatively common occurrence but still gets conspiracy theorists excited",3950

Transgender Bathroom Policy

#BoycottTarget https://t.co/UIAQ7jCqIi",http://po.st/wyGaBi,True,"Target Backlash Over Transgender Bathroom Policy Hits 'Boiling Point,' Business Insider Says","(Photo: Reuters/Fred Thornhill) A view of a Target store in Lindsay, Ontario January 15, 2015. Target Corp will abandon its ill-fated expansion into Canada less than two years after launch, the U.S. discount retailer said on Thursday, in a surprise retreat that will put more than 17,000 employees out of work and cost it billions. The company is shutting all of its 133 Canadian stores and said it expects to report about .4 billion in pre-tax losses for its fourth quarter, which finishes at the end of January. Losses are mostly due to the writedown of the Canadian investment, along with exit costs and operating losses.
The massive Target boycott by over a million consumers over its decision to allow customers and employees to use the bathroom of their chosen identity rather than biological sex has reportedly reached a ""boiling point,"" with customers deciding to bring their business elsewhere.
The Business Insider reported on data supplied by YouGov BrandIndex, measuring consumer perceptions of major brands, and revealed that while 42 percent of consumers considered shopping from Target before the boycott, that number has now fallen to 36 percent.
""Consumer perception of the brand has also dropped sharply. It's at its lowest point in two years,"" the report noted.
Despite the drop, more people still hold a positive view of Target rather than a negative one, it added.
""There's a very large group out there that supports Target's decision,"" said crisis-management expert Kevin Dinino, CEO of San Diego-based KCD PR.
Dinino said that close to 80 million people shop at Target's stores nationwide each month, and estimated that 1.5 percent of its total customers, or 1.2 million shoppers, have been left due to its bathroom controversy.
Target explained that it wants to be more inclusive by allowing customers and employees to use the bathrooms of their choosing, and said in a statement: ""In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.""
Concerned parents have protested at several of the chain's stores nationwide, however, while a petition by the American Family Association has gathered over 1.2 million signatures, calling on the policy to be reversed.
""Target's policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims. And with Target publicly boasting that men can enter women's bathrooms, where do you think predators are going to go?"" the AFA's petition states.
""Clearly, Target's dangerous new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters. We think many customers will agree. And we think the average Target customer is willing to pledge to boycott Target stores until it makes protecting women and children a priority.""
Consumer backlash against Target also manifested itself in plummeting stock prices earlier this month, with the Family Policy Institute of Washington observing that the company's stock fell from $84.10 per share on April 19 to roughly $79.36 in the days surrounding the AFA petition, explaining that a loss of $4.74 per share ""would represent a corporate loss of over $2.5 billion,"" if constant.
Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell responded to the backlash last week by stating that the company will not be reversing its policy, but sought to assure customers that safety is a major priority for the company.
""Our focus on safety is unwavering. And we want to make sure we provide a welcoming environment for all of our guests,"" Cornell said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week.
He added: ""What's been lost in this story is the fact that the vast majority of our stores, over 1,400 of our stores, already have a family restroom. We are committed over the next few months to make sure every one of our stores has that option.""",3948
673581371458199552,false,Men from #Pakistan security forces told reporters to stop probing #TashfeenMalik background or face arrest https://t.co/nypi6YPZiL,http://www.reuters.com/article/california-shooting-pakistan-idUSL3N13V08520151206#u9SRKUccfvB2242j.99,True,Pakistani security seeks to tamp down reporting on California shooter,"MULTAN, Pakistan, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Pakistani security forces appeared to be trying to dampen down reporting this weekend on the background of Tashfeen Malik, who mounted an attack alongside her husband that killed 14 people in California.
Three professors at Malik’s university said they had been advised not to talk to the media, while men claiming to be from Pakistan’s security agencies told reporters to drop their investigations into her background on pain of arrest.
An official at the interior ministry later said this was due to a “misunderstanding”.
U.S. authorities are treating last Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Bernardino as an “act of terrorism”. Malik, 29, and husband Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, were killed two hours later in a shootout with police.
The Iraq- and Syria-based Islamic State jihadist group has claimed the couple as its followers, although it has not said it was in contact with them or that it directed the attack.
Malik was born in Pakistan but spent most of her life in Saudi Arabia before she came to the United States to marry her husband, a U.S. citizen. She had a degree in pharmacy from a university in Pakistan’s central city of Multan.
On Sunday, three professors at Bahauddin Zakariya University, which Malik attended, said they had been instructed by security agencies not to speak to reporters.
One, who asked not to be named, said security officials visited the university on Saturday and removed records and pictures of Tashfeen.
“She was a very reserved person, a very quiet girl, she kept to herself,” the professor said. “I could have never imagined she was capable of something like this. And there was nothing on the surface to suggest she had such extremist tendencies.”
“I think this change in her mind, whenever it happened, must be very recent. The girl I remember ... she could not have the guts to do this.”
Another former professor said he did not remember her at all. “She was probably not someone who stood out, academically or otherwise,” he said.
UNSPECIFIED OFFENCES
Men claiming to be from security agencies, but who refused to provide identification, also sought to discourage Reuters from further reporting on Malik’s background, threatening journalists with arrest for unspecified offences.
“Whether you consider this a request or a dictation (order), I would advise you not to pursue this story,” one said.
Tim Craig, a reporter from the Washington Post, tweeted that police had prevented him from leaving his hotel in Multan.
“I’ve lost track of how many different security/intel officials I’ve had to talk to, copy my passport, etc in past 17 hours - think 12 to 16,” he tweeted.
Reuters was eventually allowed to continue reporting with a police escort provided for security reasons.
An interior ministry official later told Reuters the situation had been the result of a misunderstanding by over-enthusiastic local police.
“This is not our policy. We have nothing to hide, and we want to facilitate journalists,” the official, who did not wish to be named, said.
Several security officials said the restrictions on the press were partly due to Pakistani fears that the country would be blamed for Malik’s actions.
“Pakistan has nothing to do with this but it will be used to malign Pakistan. So of course we have to care about how this is being seen and reported,” one official said.
On Sunday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar said Pakistan was willing to give any assistance that the United States required to investigate Malik, and highlighted that she spent most of her life in Saudi Arabia.
“Such acts of terrorism which take place across the world bring a bad name to Islam,” he said. “You cannot blame the religion and the nation due to the personal actions of one person.” (Additional reporting by Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Richard Balmforth)",3909

Ted Cruz apparently.
In a move that reflected just how desperate the right-wing has become to call the Planned Parenthood terrorist attack about any but their own anti-abortion rhetoric, Republican presidential contender Ted Cruz floated the idea that the shooter was a “trangendered Leftist.”
When asked – point blank – by a reporter whether he felt his party’s violent rhetoric about Planned Parenthood could have led to the shooting, Cruz did some of the most surreal spindoctoring in American political history. No, it was the “left” that was to blame for everything, he suggested.
“Well I think there has been some vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro-life.” He later added: “This murder that occurred in Colorado is tragic, it is a criminal act we don’t fully know the motivations of this deranged individual, we know that he was a man who was registered to vote as a woman and the media promptly wants to blame him on the pro-life movement when at this point there is very little evidence to indicate that.”
To be clear there is a LOT of evidence to indicate that the killer was inspired by the pro-life movement. For one thing, he took a high-powered rifle and walked into a Planned Parenthood full of innocent strangers and started shooting. For another, he literally told the police afterwards that he did it so there would be “no more baby parts.”
Cruz wasn’t done demonstrating that he was grasping at straws. When the reporter noted all of the above evidence, Cruz went all-in with his “this was a transgender leftist” defense.
“Well it is also reported that he was registered as an independent and as a woman and a transgendered leftist activist if thats what he is…um…I don’t think it is fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left this is a murderer.”
Setting aside the fact that Cruz’s own brain seemed to shut down midway through that thought, his “reports” that the killer, identified as Robert Lewis Dear Jr., was a transgendered leftist are based on an internet rumor started by a conservative blogger named Jim Hoft who is known by many as the “dumbest man on the internet.” It’s a title he has repeatedly proved he deserves with an ever-growing series of baseless lies he writes from his right-wing conspiracy website. Ted Cruz is apparently Hoft’s biggest, and perhaps only, fan.
Not pictured below: A “transgendered leftist activist.”
Suspect confirmed as Robert L. Dear date of birth of 4/16/1958 pic.twitter.com/4v2GtIsUgT — Springs Police (@CSPDPIO) November 28, 2015
The rumor about Dear’s sexual identity began because internet sleuths noticed that a voter registration card bearing his name listed his gender as “female.” Was it just a typo? Probably. But from that evidence alone, conservatives concluded that the person was transgender and also a leftist (?) and proceeded to run with it. The rumor was debunked almost immediately when acquaintances of Dear were tracked down and not one mentioned him being anything but a violent, disturbed man. Some did remember him being firmly anti-Obama though.
Zigmond Post, who told BuzzFeed News he was a neighbor of Dear’s in Hartsel, said the man once gave him anti-Obama pamphlets. Post said he once went to Dear’s home to retrieve two dogs that had gotten loose. “We were there for a minute and the guy was already handing us anti-Obama pamphlets,” he said. According to Post, Dear said “Obama was ruining the country and needed to be impeached.”
So we reach a very puzzling existential question: If Ted Cruz has no problem gobbling up everything the Dumbest Man on the Internet writes, is he therefore dumber than the Dumbest Man himself?
I’ll leave you to ponder it.

12 July 2016 - WHO and partners today launch 7 interlinked strategies to reduce violence against children. The approaches have all been tested and all have shown concrete results. By bringing them together, WHO hopes to dramatically reduce instances of violence against children.
Over the past year, up to 1 billion children have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence, according to a recent study published in “Pediatrics”. Homicide is among the top 5 causes of death for adolescents. 1 in 4 children suffer physical abuse, and nearly 1 in 5 girls are sexually abused at least once in their lives.
The 7 strategies highlighted in the “INSPIRE” package are:
Implementation and enforcement of laws: such as those limiting access by young people to firearms and other weapons (South Africa) and those criminalizing the violent punishment of children by parents (many European countries).
Norms and values: by changing beliefs and behaviours around gender roles (India, South Africa, Uganda and the United States).
Safe environments: by targeting violent “hotspots” and enhancing the built environment, for example, by improving housing (Colombia, United Kingdom, and the United States).
Parent and caregiver support: such as the provision of training in parenting (Kenya, Liberia, Myanmar, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States).
Income and economic strengthening: including microfinance combined with training around gender norms (Afghanistan, Cote d’Ivoire, South Africa, Uganda, and the United States).
Response and support services: such as treatment programmes for juvenile offenders (many European countries and the United States).
Education and life skills: for example, establishing a safe school environment and improving children’s life and social skills (China, Croatia, South Africa, Uganda, and the United States).
“Knowledge about the extent and harms of violence against children is growing, together with evidence about effective strategies for prevention”, notes Dr Etienne Krug, Director at WHO. “Now we need to build on that knowledge to work collectively to create the safe, stable, and nurturing environments that protect children and adolescents from violent harm.”
The new package has been produced in collaboration with partners including: End Violence Against Children, Together for Girls, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), US Agency for International Development (USAID), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank. The package is being released in the context of the worldwide launch of the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children.
The partnership aims to bring together governments, UN agencies, civil society, the private sector, researchers, and academics to build political will, promote solutions, accelerate action and strengthen collaboration to prevent violence against children. WHO is a founding member of the partnership, and will support work to implement strategies in countries.
The initiative also aims to support achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDG target 16.2 to “end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children”, and implementation of World Health Assembly resolution WHA69.5 on the “WHO global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children”.

In the Maury County School District, students were assigned a Five Pillars of Islam project that included the translation of the pillar of “Shahada” as being, “There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.”
Joy Ellis, the mother of a seventh-grader at Spring Hill Middle School, said that Christian children should not be instructed to write the Shahada.
“This is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP,” Ellis said. “I didn’t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.”
Another mother of a seventh-grade girl, Brandee Porterfield, complained to officials at Spring Hill Middle School because of its overemphasis on Islam to the exclusion of Christianity and Judaism.
Porterfield said she has no objections to her daughter learning details of the Islamic religion, but she objects to the fact that the history unit didn’t devote similar time to Christianity or Judaism.
“It really did bother me that they skipped the whole chapter on the rise of Christianity and they spent three weeks just studying Islam,” she said.
Porterfield and other parents were also concerned with the school’s decision to have children write and recite the Islamic creed.
“But what really did bother me,” Porterfield said, “was that they did this assignment where they wrote out the Five Pillars of Islam, including having the children learn and write the Shahada, which is the Islamic conversion creed.”
“I spoke with the teacher and the principal,” she said. “They are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter. Even though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.”
Porterfield said the class skipped Christianity because it’s not required by the state’s standards. Those standards, TN Core, are very similar to the national Common Core standards, though in May Gov. Bill Haslam signed a bill eliminating Common Core.
In Tennessee, 85 percent of the residents identify as Christian, according to a comprehensive U.S. Religious Landscape Survey conducted by the Pew Center in 2008. Only one percent of state residents identify as Muslim.
Jan Hanvey, Maury County Public Schools’ middle school supervisor, said that most of the three-week unit discussed things like government, culture, geography, and economics, rather than theology. She also said that the chapters on Christianity and Judaism are scheduled to be taught at the end of the year with the “Age of Exploration” unit.
Maury County Director of Schools, Chris Marczak, defended the curriculum in a statement, saying that the school system is in no way endorsing Islam over other religions or trying to “indoctrinate” students.
“It is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate,” Marczak said.
Porterfield, however, finds Marczak’s assurances unconvincing.
“They are not going over anything else. So for the students to have to memorize this prayer, it does seem like it is indoctrination,” she said.
A meeting between parents and school teachers and administrators has been scheduled for Sept. 17 to allow Porterfield and other concerned Springhill parents to voice their concerns about the state’s history curriculum.

Chelsea Clinton implies that marijuana can kill you.

2016, y’all.

https://t.co/ThWiCUQspN #mmot #p2 #tcot #tlot",http://www.marijuana.com/blog/news/2016/09/chelsea-clinton-implies-marijuana-can-kill-you/,True,Chelsea Clinton Implies Marijuana Can Kill You,"The former and possible future first daughter of the United States acknowledges that marijuana has medical value, but she also seems to believe that cannabis use can lead to death.
“Anecdotally we have lots of evidence in…epilepsy but also in autism, in stimulating appetite for people who are on intensive chemotherapy regimens, for people who have non-epilepsy seizure disorders and challenges,” Chelsea Clinton said on Saturday.
“But we also have anecdotal evidence now from Colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the coroner believes, after they died, there was drug interactions with other things they were taking.”
Clinton, the daughter of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, was answering a question about her mother’s position on marijuana rescheduling during an appearance before a group of students at Youngstown State University in Ohio.
The Clinton campaign did not respond to Marijuana.com’s request for clarification about what the candidate’s daughter was referring to in implying that marijuana use has been tied to deaths apparently caused by its interaction with other drugs.
Legalization opponents have attempted to blame a handful of deaths in Colorado on cannabis edibles, but in those cases — one in which a college student visiting the state from Wyoming leapt off a balcony and one in which a man shot his wife to death — no other drugs were involved, so there are no “interactions” to speak of. And in the latter case, the suspect did not die so there was no coroner examination of him.
Elsewhere in the weekend remarks, Clinton reiterated her mother’s pledge to respect the right of states to implement their own marijuana laws without federal interference.
“She supports states making whatever choices they think are right vis–à–vis medical or recreational marijuana use,” she said.
But while candidate Clinton has said she is “100 percent in favor of medical uses for marijuana,” Chelsea implied that she wants cannabis to go through the Food and Drug Administration approval process, which she called the “gold standard for the world” even though the agency has approved a number of drugs that later proved to be very dangerous.
“We just need so much more data than we have so that people who might benefit have the chance to benefit, people who might be in danger are protected,” she said. “So absolutely my mom strongly supports the need for more rigorous study and then subjecting it, as we do kind of everything else that might have a medicinal purpose, to FDA approval, scrutiny and ultimately regulation.”
Her mother has promised that if elected she will reclassify marijuana to Schedule II from its current status under Schedule I, the most restrictive category.
Last month, the Drug Enforcement Administration, acting on a recommendation from FDA, denied long-pending petitions to reschedule cannabis.
Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump face off in the first of three scheduled presidential debates Monday night.
It has been suggested that Clinton’s struggling outreach to millennial voters could be strengthened by endorsing marijuana legalization. Young people overwhelmingly support ending cannabis prohibition, and polls show that a sizable chunk are now supporting Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein, both of whom have made marijuana law reform centerpieces of their campaigns.

It was enormously popular, in part because of Ms. Carne and the running gag that became a national meme.
Slender but shapely, with a pixieish haircut and a gamely irrepressible manner, she would appear before the camera and declare, in one variation or another, “It’s sock-it-to-me time,” and she would be subsequently doused with water or she’d vanish through a trap door in the floor or have some other indignity visited on her.
The phrase “sock it to me,” evidently seized by the show’s writers from a chant in Aretha Franklin’s recording of the Otis Redding song “Respect,” became cool, hip enough lingo that celebrity guests appeared on “Laugh-In” in cameo bits to utter it, including, most famously, Richard Nixon, less than two months before he was elected president in 1968.
Ms. Carne was trained in dance and theater and reportedly took the name Judy at the suggestion of a teacher. The name Carne came from a character in a play by the English playwright Charlotte Hastings. She was born Joyce Audrey Botterill in Northampton on April 27, 1939. Her parents were greengrocers.

Ms. Carne left “Laugh-In” in 1970. The sock-it-to-me label had become trying to live with, she said; people would douse her with water on the street.
That year she starred in a Broadway revival of the musical “The Boy Friend,” but her life began spiraling out of control as a drug habit grew worse. She was arrested several times, and as a result she wasn’t being cast as readily as she had been, and her nightclub bookings dried up.
She and Mr. Reynolds divorced in 1965, and in her 1985 autobiography, “Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside,” written with Bob Merrill, she wrote that Mr. Reynolds was abusive.
In the memoir she confessed to myriad love affairs with name brand actors and others, and she acknowledged her drug abuse, including an addiction to heroin. A second marriage, to Robert Bergmann (sometimes spelled Bergman) in 1970, lasted less than a year, though he figured importantly later in her life. She leaves no immediate survivors.
Mr. Barrett said he met Ms. Carne when she returned to England after the 1978 automobile accident, settling in Pitsford, near Northampton. He was a hairdresser and she came in to have her hair cut, he said. Ms. Carne was popular with her neighbors and performed occasionally in cabaret and dinner theater, he said, but she was frail and remained so. “She was a bit of a recluse toward the end,” Mr. Barrett said.
The accident came about after she began spending time again with her former husband Mr. Bergmann. He was behind the wheel when their car went off the road in Bucks County, Pa., and she broke her neck.
“I lost sight of myself in the last few years,” she told People magazine during her recuperation. “My whole life has been extremes. It took me near death to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”
She added: “I guess this is the ultimate sock-it-to-me.”",3627

Gunfire and explosions were heard as the police moved in to end the hostage crisis that had stretched for 16 hours.
who was MAN HARON MONis? - 50 year old Iranian refugee who moved to Australia
- Was facing charges for being an accessory in the murder of his ex-wife
- Also faced more than 50 allegations of indecent and sexual assault - Was convicted to 300 hours of community service for sending hate letters to families of dead Australian soldiers
Three people, including the hostage-taker were killed, police said. A police officer was also injured but was in a stable condition.
Andrew Scipione, New South Wales (NSW) police commissioner, commended the work of his department.
He said there had been 17 hostages in total.
Television images showed hostages streaming out of the Lindt Chocolate cafe. Some were taken out in stretches as ambulance sirens wailed.
The hostage crisis had begun early on Monday.
Australian media, quoting a police source, identified the hostage-taker as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian refugee with a criminal past.
""This is a very disturbing incident,"" Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, said hours after the hostage crisis started.
Abbott called the siege a ""brush with terrorism"".
""He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,"" the prime minister said.
""As the siege unfolded ... he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL death cult.""
Channel 10 news said it received a video in which a hostage inside the cafe had relayed the gunman's demands. The station said police requested they not broadcast it, and Scipione separately asked all media that might be contacted by the gunman to urge him instead to talk to police.
Hundreds of police flooded into Sydney's business district, streets were closed and offices evacuated.
The public was told to stay away from Martin Place - the area where the Lindt Chocolate Cafe is located.
The Lindt cafe is located at the Elizabeth Street end of Martin Place. Next door, is the Reserve Bank of Australia. Directly opposite the cafe are the TV studios for Australian broadcaster Channel 7. The New South Wales Parliament was evacuated as well as the nearby Supreme Court building. Other major buildings within the perimeter include the world famous Sydney Opera House. [Google Maps]
Terror threats
The hostage crisis came after Australia joined the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group after an appeal by US President Barack Obama several months ago. Australia has deployed a squadron of fighter jets and hundreds of troops to the Middle East.
The Australian government had raised the terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of ISIL.
Two weeks later, a known suspect was shot dead by police in Melbourne after he tried to attack police officers with a knife.
Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia's three largest cities - Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.
One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an ISIL leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.
ISIL, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past.
In September, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, an ISIL spokesperson, issued an audio message urging ""lone wolf"" attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia.

Despite appearing increasingly isolated, Merkel has resisted pressure from some conservatives to cap the influx of refugees, or to close Germany’s borders.
Support for her conservative bloc has slipped as concerns mount about how Germany will integrate the 1.1 million migrants who arrived last year, while crime and security are also in the spotlight after a wave of assaults on women in Cologne at New Year by men of north African and Arab appearance.
The influx has played into the hands of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose support is now in the double digits, and whose leader was quoted on Saturday saying that migrants entering illegally should, if necessary, be shot.
Merkel said it was important to stress that most refugees had only been allowed to stay for a limited period.
“We need ... to say to people that this is a temporary residential status and we expect that, once there is peace in Syria again, once IS has been defeated in Iraq, that you go back to your home country with the knowledge that you have gained,” she told a regional meeting of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
Merkel said 70 percent of the refugees who fled to Germany from former Yugoslavia in the 1990s had returned.
Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, has threatened to take the government to court if the flow of asylum seekers is not cut.
Merkel urged other European countries to offer more help “because the numbers need to be reduced even further and must not start to rise again, especially in spring”.
A MILLION MORE
Fabrice Leggeri, the head of the European Union’s border agency Frontex, said a U.N. estimate that up to a million migrants could try to come to Europe via the eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans next year was realistic.
“It would be a big achievement if we could keep the number ... stable,” he told the magazine Der Spiegel.
Merkel said all EU states should have an interest in protecting the bloc’s external borders, and all would suffer if the internal passport-free Schengen zone collapsed and national borders were closed.
AfD leader Frauke Petry told the Mannheimer Morgen newspaper that Germany needed to reduce the influx through agreements with neighboring Austria and a reinforcement of the EU’s external borders.
But she also said it should not be shy about turning people back and creating “border protection installations” - and that border guards should, if necessary, shoot at migrants trying to enter illegally.
No police officer wanted to shoot at a migrant, Petry said, adding “I don’t want that either but, ultimately, deterrence includes the use of armed force”.
Such comments evoke memories of Germany’s Cold War division, when guards in the communist East, led by Erich Honecker, were under orders to shoot people attempting to cross the heavily fortified border into the West.
“The last German politician who let refugees be shot at was Erich Honecker,” said Thomas Oppermann, a senior member of the Social Democrats.",3560

1. Heart disease

3. Medical error

https://t.co/F6f182uN8E https://t.co/qQtv3Vq3lK",http://onforb.es/1Oh7wh1,True,"Medical Error Is A Leading Cause Of Death, But You Won't See It On The CDC's List","If someone trips and accidentally disconnects a ventilator power cord and the patient dies, the cause listed on the death certificate is likely to be respiratory failure. It's not that anyone necessarily is trying to hide the fact that a mistake was made. It's that ""medical error"" isn't even an option on death certificates.
And that, Dr. Martin Makary says, is a mistake. While tripping on ventilator cords rarely happens in the United States, medical errors are plentiful, according to a new analysis by Makary, a cancer surgeon and professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Michael Daniel, a Hopkins medical student.
Makary and Daniel cite several definitions of medical error from the scientific literature:
""An unintended act (either of omission or commission) or one that does not achieve its intended outcome.""
""The failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (an error of execution).""
""The use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (an error of planning).""
""A deviation from the process of care that may or may not cause harm to the patient.""
They estimate that more than a quarter of a million U.S. hospital patients die each year as a result of a medical error, making it the third leading cause of death, behind only heart disease and cancer. But, Makary told me, ""in generating our national health statistics, these problems are not even showing up.""
Makary and Daniel's estimate is far higher than the 44,000 to 98,000 annual hospital deaths from medical errors estimated in a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). But it's lower than the more than 400,000 deaths estimated in a 2013 article by John James, a Texas man who created Patient Safety America after, he says, his 19-year-old son died in 2002 ""as a result of uninformed, careless and unethical care by cardiologists at a hospital.""
In their paper, published in the BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, Makary and Daniel call the IOM estimate ""limited and outdated."" In an email to me, James noted that Makary and Daniel based their estimate on three of the four studies he had used but used ""different assumptions to arrive at a substantially different number. In the text of that paper, the authors admit that many errors are going to go uncounted with their approach. I dealt with those uncertainties in my paper, although, as you well know, exact counts are elusive at this point.""
Pretty much everyone who's studied medical errors would agree with James' last observation. The problem, Makary and Daniel conclude in their paper, is that in the United States, as in 116 other countries, death certificates rely on assigning an International Classification of Disease (ICD) code to the cause of death. The first ICD codes were developed more than a century ago. You've likely seen them on paperwork at your doctor's office, which uses ICD codes in medical records and reimbursement claims.
""The system that we have now is not designed for today,"" Makary told me. ""Billing codes were never meant for national health statistics. People just don't die of billing codes. People just don't die of bacteria and hardened arteries."" They die from communication breakdowns and diagnostic errors as well, causes that are not an option on death certificates, he said.
Makary and Daniel and two other Hopkins medical students wrote an appeal Sunday to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, urging that the agency change the way it collects death statistics.",3508

A compelling story about a heroic Muslim security guard stopping a suicide bomber from entering the Stade de France on Friday, saving perhaps hundreds of lives, is making the rounds on social media. But it's not true.
The rumour sprang from a gripping account of the events outside the stadium which was published by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The story quoted a security guard who asked to only be identified by his first name, Zouheir. The man described how one of the suicide attackers had a ticket to the match between France and Germany, but was turned away from the gates when guards found his explosive vest. The man backed away from security guards and detonated the explosives.
Zouheir gave a detailed account of events at the stadium, statements that were confirmed to the Wall Street Journal reporters by a police officer. But although the story relied on his account, it wasn't actually him who turned away the bomber - a detail that was confirmed to BBC Trending by Journal reporter Joshua Robinson. Instead, Zouheir was stationed elsewhere in the stadium, and related what he heard from colleagues who were closer to the bomb blast. And although his name is of Middle Eastern origin, his religion was never mentioned in the piece.

Join the conversation on this and other stories here.
Those facts did not, however, stop Zouheir from being hailed as a hero - and sometimes specifically as a Muslim hero - on social networks and on news sites including the Mirror, the Huffington Post and others. In a headline posted on Mail Online, Piers Morgan hailed a ""brave Muslim named Zouheir"", but that story was later edited.
""Zouheir"" has been mentioned more than 8,000 times on Twitter, with all of the most popular tweets in reference to the Paris story. Several users claimed that there was some sort of cover-up happening around the story, or that it was being suppressed due to supposed anti-Muslim media bias. Others shared it to highlight what they thought was an ""important"" story and a ""ray of hope"" in a grim situation.
Hundreds of posts were also shared on Facebook and Instagram, and typical were images such as this one, which was retweeted more than 1,300 times:
The rumour was inadvertently fuelled by another Wall Street Journal reporter, who tweeted:
Al Omran, a correspondent in Saudi Arabia, quickly realised his mistake and tweeted a correction two hours later:
But while his initial tweet attracted more than 300 retweets, the second one was only shared a handful of times.
Zouheir's story went viral even though an authentic story of a Muslim hero has emerged from the Paris attacks. Safer, a bartender at the Casa Nostra restaurant, spoke to the BBC's James Longman, and recounted how he pulled two injured women into the basement as gunfire continued on the street outside. His story had only a handful of mentions on social media as of Tuesday afternoon.

767541796410839040,non-rumor,POWELL BREAKS SILENCE: CLINTONS TRYING TO 'PIN' SCANDAL ON ME! https://t.co/b1h1PesnKY,http://pge.sx/2bHvIO5,True,Colin Powell sets record straight on involvement in email scandal,"Colin Powell has broken his silence about his alleged involvement in the Hillary Clinton email scandal, saying her team is falsely trying to blame him.
When asked by the FBI about her email use at the State Department, Clinton reportedly told investigators that former Secretary of State Powell had advised her to use a personal email account at a private dinner.
But Powell, who had said last week in a statement that he had no recollection of the conversation, told Page Six at Saturday’s Apollo in the Hamptons event, “The truth is she was using it (her personal email) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did [during my term as secretary of state].
“Her people have been trying to pin it on me.”
When asked why Clinton’s team were attempting to blame him, he responded, “Why do you think?”
Despite appearing angered by the situation, he added, “It doesn’t bother me. It’s okay, I’m free.”
The story about Powell advising Clinton to use personal email was included in FBI notes of their interview with the Democratic nominee handed to Congress on Tuesday. James B. Comey, the bureau’s director, decided not to pursue criminal charges against her.
Journalist Joe Conason reported a conversation between Clinton and Powell took place at a dinner party hosted by Madeleine Albright at her home in Washington in his upcoming book, “Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,” according to the Times.
Conason writes that those present — including Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice — were all asked to offer “one salient bit of counsel” to Clinton early in her term as secretary of state.
“Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer,” Conason wrote. “Saying that his use of personal email had been transformative for the department,” Powell “thus confirmed a decision she had made months earlier — to keep her personal account and use it for most messages.”
But Powell did not have a server at his house or use outside contractors, as Clinton did, the Times reported. Plus the rules governing electronic communication got more strict between Powell’s time in office and Clinton’s.
Powell’s office said in a statement released Thursday night that he had no recollection of the dinner conversation. He did write Clinton an email memo describing his use of personal email for unclassified messages “and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department,” the statement said.
Powell was among the guests at the star-studded Apollo in the Hamptons “Night of Legends” bash, hosted by billionaire Ron Perelman, Patriots owner Bob Kraft, Jon Bon Jovi and Dick Parsons in East Hampton. The event, with performers including Lionel Richie, Gwen Stefani, Ciara, Eagles legend Joe Walsh and Pharrell Williams. It raised $5 million for music and educational programs for kids at the historic Harlem theater.
Power players in the room included NBCUniversal chairman Ron Meyer, music guru Irving Azoff, Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman and wife Christine, hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, David Zaslav, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo with Sandra Lee, media mogul Jay Penske with Elaine Irwin, the Apollo Theater’s Jonell Procope, and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.

Four people have been killed and several injured in shootings in the western Canadian province of Saskatchewan, police say.
They say a male suspect is now in custody and children have been moved to safety after the shootings at La Loche Community School and another location.
Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said earlier that five people had been killed, but this was later corrected.
The school shooting was ""every parent's worst nightmare"", Mr Trudeau said.
""The community is reeling.""
Mr Trudeau, who was speaking in Davos, Switzerland, also praised ""the first responders who acted quickly and bravely"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption CBC news anchor Jill Morgan: ""People killed are all known by this community""
Witnesses at the school described screaming and more than half a dozen shots.
Kevin Janvier, acting mayor of La Loche, said that his 23-year-old daughter Marie, a teacher, was one of the victims at the school.
He also said police had told him that the gunman first shot two of his siblings at home and then made his way to the school.
Canada's gun laws
To buy a gun or ammunition, Canadians must have a licence under the Firearms Act, which requires a safety course, a waiting period and background checks
There are three classifications of guns: non-restricted - shotguns and rifles, commonly used for hunting; restricted - certain handguns and some semi-automatic long guns; and prohibited - most handguns, fully automatic firearms, converted automatics, firearms with a sawed-off barrel, and some military rifles like the AK-47
In 2012, the government of Canada ended the Long Gun Registry, a database linking guns with their respective owners - this means gun owners no longer have to register non-restricted or non-prohibited guns
Canada's gun-related homicide rate (0.5 per 100,000) is about seven times lower than the United States' (3.5 per 100,000). However, Canada's gun-related murder rate is higher than many of its peers, including Japan (0.01 per 100,000) and the United Kingdom (0.06 per 100,000)
Gun-related crime is highest in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which also report the highest rates of non-gun-related violent crime
'Shock and sorrow'
At a news conference, Maureen Levy, a senior officer at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), said: ""There's no risk to public safety at this time. This is truly a tragedy.""
She provided no further details.
The RCMP said officers were called about ""an active shooter"" at 13:00 local time (19:00 GMT) and detained the suspect 45 minutes later, Canada's CBC broadcaster reports.
""Words cannot express my shock and sorrow at the horrific events today in La Loche,"" Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said in a statement.
""My thoughts and prayers are with all the victims, their families and friends and all the people of the community.""
About 900 students attend La Loche Community School for kindergarten through to grade 12 (the last year of high school).
""I ran outside the school,"" Noel Desjarlais, a Grade 10 student, told CBC.
""There was lots of screaming, there was about six, seven shots before I got outside. I believe there was more shots by the time I did get out.""
La Loche is an aboriginal community of about 3,000 people.
It is located nearly 900km north of the provincial capital, Regina.",3469

""Who's a good boy?"" asked National Doggy Appreciation Society president June Erhardt, speaking before an estimated 300 canines ranging from border collie to schnauzer. ""Who? Who?""
Added Erhardt: ""Is it you? Is it you?""
Despite its consensus on overall dog adorableness, the dog-loving community remains sharply divided on the question of who is a good boy. Some say the answer is ""Such a good boy, yes."" Others contend the good boy ""needs his belly rubbed, yes, oh yes."" Still other factions maintain that the only good boy is ""my special little snuffy-snuffers, the bestest of all the best boys there is.""
With canine-cuddliness levels at an all-time high and adorability-boosting ribbons and chew toys plentiful at pet stores across the nation, no resolution to the good-boy-identity issue appears to be on the horizon.
""The dog owners of this country still have a great many questions that require answers,"" said Indianapolis NDAS delegate Janine Mulhern. ""Who is, in fact, my favorite little guy? Who, for that matter, has a fuzzy little tummy-wummy? And, perhaps most importantly, who wants to go outside?""
""Outside? Outside?"" continued Mulhern, rattling a leash in her outstretched hand. ""These are issues that must be addressed. Our high-pitched, cutesy-wutesy voices will not be silenced.""
According to the results of a recent NDAS ""Who's A Good Boy?"" survey, dog owners are split roughly into three camps, with 40 percent favoring ""What a pretty, pretty, pretty boy"" and 31 percent holding that ""You're such a puppy!"" The final 29 percent argued that the correct answer is, ""You are such a stinker, a stinker, a stinky-dinky-dinker!"" The NDAS survey did not, however, include members of The Pat-Pat League, an extremist group that wants entirely non-verbal resolutions to the issue, including play-wrestling, head-rubbing, fur-tousling, chin-scritching, and even great big hugs.
""The question of precisely who is a good boy is of fundamental importance to millions of Americans, many of whom pose this query to their loved ones several times a day,"" said Marvin Sidowsky, an Atlanta-area veterinarian. ""In fact, they may even find themselves asking it several times in quick succession while dangling a rawhide chew stick in the air. Clearly, it's high time we had an answer.""
""Right, Bogey? Right, Bogey?"" said Sidowsky, rubbing noses with his Yorkshire terrier. ""Oh, no… oh, no… No, no, no, no, no. No no no no no no no no no no. Nononononononononono.""
""Awwwwww,"" concluded Sidowsky, wrapping Bogey in a baby-blue terrycloth towel and cradling him like an infant.
Despite the differences of opinion, dog owners remain optimistic that the good-boy question can be resolved.
""Don't worry, it's okay,"" said Anita Perlich, Columbia, SC, NDAS chapter president and owner of four Irish setters. ""There's nothing to be scared of.""
Addressing reporters from a dog-hair-covered couch in her D.C. townhouse, Erhardt stressed the need for calm. ""Nothing to worry about… Uncle Joe always does that. Uncle Joe! Down, boy! Down, boy! Down!""
""He's just excited,"" continued Erhardt, stressing the need for a positive outlook. ""He's not used to new people, that's all. Uncle Joe! Get off the nice man!""",3452

As they commuted to work, performed household tasks, sat around with family and friends, engaged in hobbies, or watched television, each of the 320 million residents of the United States reportedly acknowledged to themselves that they simply could not continue doing any of this, not for a single moment.
According to sources, every last member of the nation’s populace further recognized this has gone on for far too long already.
“I can’t keep doing this,” each person in the country reportedly thought while shopping for groceries, replying to emails, sitting through meetings, walking to or from their parking spot, or tucking their children into bed. “Things can’t go on like this. They just can’t.”
“There’s no way,” the entire U.S. population added silently to themselves.
Reports confirmed the thought was identical across all demographics, with every American, regardless of income, age, occupation, political affiliation, religion, or health, coming to the realization that this just keeps going on and on and on and there isn’t any reason to think it will end anytime soon.
The stark notion is said to have occupied the mind of a bank teller in downtown Cincinnati late this morning, as well as the customer whose balance he was checking, the three people standing behind the customer in line, the dentist filling a cavity three floors up, the patient having her cavity filled, a handful of people waiting for the bus outside the building, dozens of pedestrians at the adjacent crosswalk, each of the drivers who passed by them, everyone else in the greater Cincinnati area, and indeed everyone in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
“Why am I even trying anymore?” thought Minneapolis cashier Sarah Collins, 23, while ringing up the purchase of Walter Nathanson, a 68-year-old retiree who arrived at the exact same conclusion while taking his change, folding it neatly in his wallet, and telling the young woman to have a nice day. “What’s the fucking point?”
As the nation’s residents wondered how they could possibly carry on with even one more second of this, sources confirmed they continued to chop vegetables, ride in elevators, participate in conference calls, lie in bed next to their spouse, take crosstown buses, reheat leftovers, walk upstairs, put gas in their cars, put their shoes on, shave, stare blankly at a computer or phone screen, walk back downstairs, make photocopies, or pour themselves a drink of water.
While reactions to the thought were imperceptible to most casual onlookers, an audible exhalation reportedly left the lips of all 320 million of the country’s inhabitants at the exact same time. In addition, the eyes of the entire population are believed to have been cast downward for a brief, simultaneous moment as they each individually concluded that they simply didn’t have it in them to keep this up.
“Jesus…” thought every American upon evaluating the circumstances that had brought them to this point. “I just can’t deal with this. Not anymore.”
At press time, reports indicated every single person in the country had gritted their teeth and forced their mouth into a resigned smile before moving on with their day.",3450

Marriages Edit
Women's Rights Activism and Run for the Presidency Edit
A free thinker, Victoria Woodhull created Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly, a radical publication, in 1870 with her sister, Tennessee. The publication gave the sisters a place to express their ideas on social reforms, including women's suffrage, birth control and free love. The journal also published the first English translation of Karl Marx's The Communist Manifesto.
Careers Edit
Life in England and third marriage Edit
In October 1876, Woodhull divorced her second husband, Colonel Blood. Less than a year later, exhausted and possibly depressed, she left to start a new life. When Commodore Vanderbilt died, his son William Henry Vanderbilt gave Victoria and Tennessee a large sum of money to leave the country and set up in England. She made her first public appearance as a lecturer at St. James's Hall in London on December 4, 1877. Her lecture was called The Human Body, the Temple of God, a lecture which she had previously presented in the United States. Present at one of her lectures was the banker John Biddulph Martin. They began to see each other and married on October 31, 1883. His family disapproved of the union, but eventually gave in. From then on, she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin. Under that name, she published the magazine, The Humanitarian, from 1892 to 1901, with help from her daughter Zula Woodhull. After her husband died in 1901, Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country, establishing residence at Bredon's Norton's, where she built a village school with Tennessee and Zula. Through her work at Bredon's Norton's school, she became a champion for education reform in English village schools with the addition of kindergarten curriculum.[48]
Views on abortion and eugenics Edit
Her opposition to abortion is frequently cited by opponents of abortion when writing about first wave feminism. The most common Woodhull quotations cited by opponents of abortion are: “the rights of children as individuals begin while yet they remain the foetus”[49][50] “Every woman knows that if she were free, she would never bear an unwished-for child, nor think of murdering one before its birth.[51] Woodhull also promoted eugenics which was popular in the early 20th century prior to World War II. Her interest in eugenics might have been motivated by the profound intellectual impairment of her son. She advocated, among other things, sex education, ""marrying well,"" and pre-natal care as a way to bear healthier children and to prevent mental and physical disease. Her writings demonstrate views closer to those of the anarchist eugenists, rather than the coercive eugenists like Sir Francis Galton. In 2006, publisher Michael W. Perry claimed in his book ""Lady Eugenist"" that Woodhull supported the forcible sterilization of those she considered unfit to breed. He based his claim on a New York Times article from 1927 in which she concurred with the ruling of the case Buck v. Bell. If this article accurately states her views, it would stand in stark contrast to her earlier works in which she advocated social freedom and opposed government interference in matters of love and marriage. Woodhull-Martin died on June 9, 1927 at Norton Park in Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire.[52]

Late Thursday night, roughly 75 people a minute were adding their name to the petition as it clicked over 1 million, just after 10:30 pm Eastern Time.
“That’s a million families who are going to spread the word about Target, so they may not get those customers back,” or their money, said Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, which has hosted the boycott.
Target’s “management is just going to have step up here [and] say ‘We’re selling hammers and hats, we’re not into social engineering,'” he said.
The boycott was announced April 20 by the association, one day after Target revealed its decision to favor its few transgender customers and staff over the rest of the population. A study of the 2010 census data suggests that only about 1 in 2,400 adults change their names to match names used by the other sex.
Wildmon’s association wants to affirm people’s privacy in bathrooms and changing rooms, but also to block the progressives’ multi-front push to stigmatize and outlaw any recognition of the average differences between women and men, and between boys and girls. The LGBT agenda “is being rammed down people’s throats, and people are losing their jobs because of it, and it is becoming so that you can’t think differently from these people or you’re [called] a hater or a bigot,” he said.
Since the decision was announced, numerous comments, articles, and videos protesting the store’s one-sided decision have gone viral. Public opinion has moved and hardened in opposition to the previously bizarre notion of dual-sex bathrooms and changing rooms, and Target’s brand as a family friendly store has taken a hit, as the online conversation shifted from its claim of “cheap chic” to worries of privacy, sexual predators, and the anger at the company’s disregard for the reasoned judgement of its middle-class customers.
“This is how people can fight back — they’re not going to shop at Target,” said Wildmon.

Campaign Donations Link top GOP contenders to #DylannRoof. #TedCruz returns $8k.
http://t.co/L09BXKtNkR http://t.co/eUQuAQSvsE",http://nyti.ms/1GBB2Mn,True,White Supremacist Who Influenced Charleston Suspect Donated to 2016 G.O.P. Campaigns,"The leader of a white supremacist group that apparently influenced Dylann Roof, the suspect in the killing of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church last week, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns, including those of 2016 presidential contenders such as Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul, records show.
Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, said Sunday night that he would be returning about $8,500 in donations that he had received from the Texas donor, Earl Holt III, who lists himself as president of the Council of Conservative Citizens.
“We just learned this evening that Mr. Holt had contributed to the campaign,” a spokesman for the Cruz campaign said in an email to The New York Times. “We will be immediately refunding all those donations.”
Mr. Paul’s campaign said Monday that it planned to send $2,250 received from Mr. Holt to a victims’ fund set up in the wake of the shooting.
“RandPAC is donating the funds to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund to assist the victims families,” said Sergio Gor, a spokesman for the campaign. Mr. Holt made four separate donations to the Paul campaign last year, records show. The campaign could not confirm the total received but said that all the money it identified from the white supremacist leader would be donated to the fund.
The Guardian first reported on Mr. Holt’s donations to the Republican contenders.
A manifesto that appeared on a website registered to Mr. Roof said that the manifesto’s author had first learned of “brutal black-on-white murders” from the Council of Conservative Citizens’ website.
Mr. Holt, in a statement posted online in his name, said he was not surprised to learn that Mr. Roof had found out about “black-on-white violent crime” from his group because, he said, it was one of the few that had the courage to disclose “the seemingly endless incidents involving black-on-white murder.” But he said his group does not advocate violence and should not be held responsible for the shootings.

The group is regarded by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a leading authority on hate crimes, as a white supremacist extremist organization that opposes “race mixing” as a religious affront and that vilifies blacks as an inferior race.
Spokesmen for Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and Mr. Paul, a senator from Kentucky, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the donations.
Mr. Holt, who identified himself in some donation records as a Texas “slumlord,” has also given money to a number of other current and former Republican members of Congress, including Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, former Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Representative Steve King of Iowa, and former Representative Todd Akin of Missouri.",3351

Bannon an update on AFA’s Target Boycott efforts, which has now gathered over a million signatures.
“It’s been incredible,” Rios said. “We’ve had quite an outpouring. We have right now 1,137,000 families who signed on to the boycott.”
“Target stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,” said Rios. She and Bannon discussed reports that Target has lost as much as $2 billion in market capitalization as a result of the current decline.
According to additional reports Target had lost as much as $2.5 billion dollars in stock value during this period given their Friday numbers.
Target stock prices dropped in 10 days after the retailer announced a new policy to allow customers to use whichever bathroom or fitting room accords to their gender identity. On Friday, the shares of Target Corporation Common Stock (TGT) fell 2.52 percent in one day, according to recent reports. In addition since April 19th, the day they announced the new policy, the stock went from a share value of $84.14 to $79.27 per share. That’s a drop of 5.8 percent in 10 days. The Family Policy institute says they estimate that to be a loss to the company of $2.5 billion dollars.
“Target’s response is that they are standing by their policy. They want everyone to feel welcome, and their solution is that if women are uncomfortable with men coming into their bathrooms, they should use the family bathroom. So, rather than the 0.3 percent of the population that claim the transgender status, they want the women to use the family bathroom,” she added.
Continued Rios, “The chief concern, even more than the trauma for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms, the chief concern of the American Family Association is the predators who will take advantage … and we have a long list of predators who have done that.”
“This is not going to stop with Target if we don’t take a very strong stand now,” Rios said. “I would say on the positive side, we’ve had other corporations come to us privately and say they’re watching. They were considering changing their policies, but they’re watching this boycott and they’re saying, you know, maybe not. Maybe we’re not going to go in that direction. So, a lot hinges on it, and this is something simple that people can do. We are in dialogue with other companies, other corporations encouraging them not to do this. And of course if they do, we’ll have to apply the same thing that we applied to Target,” she concluded.
Rios also noted: “I don’t know if people realize that the Obama Education Department has been pushing this whole thing of breaking down the barriers in the bathrooms in public school now this whole year. They are actually threatening to withhold money from schools if schools do not accommodate children, boys and girls who think they are the other gender … that they can lost their funding. So, this has been a battle by school boards. There’s a huge one that went on in fairfax, Virginia, just this past year and they lost. The parents lost.”

“Target stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,” said Rios. She and Bannon discussed reports that Target has lost as much as $2 billion in market capitalization as a result of the current decline.
According to additional reports Target had lost as much as $2.5 billion dollars in stock value during this period given their Friday numbers.
Target stock prices dropped in 10 days after the retailer announced a new policy to allow customers to use whichever bathroom or fitting room accords to their gender identity. On Friday, the shares of Target Corporation Common Stock (TGT) fell 2.52 percent in one day, according to recent reports. In addition since April 19th, the day they announced the new policy, the stock went from a share value of $84.14 to $79.27 per share. That’s a drop of 5.8 percent in 10 days. The Family Policy institute says they estimate that to be a loss to the company of $2.5 billion dollars.
“Target’s response is that they are standing by their policy. They want everyone to feel welcome, and their solution is that if women are uncomfortable with men coming into their bathrooms, they should use the family bathroom. So, rather than the 0.3 percent of the population that claim the transgender status, they want the women to use the family bathroom,” she added.
Continued Rios, “The chief concern, even more than the trauma for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms, the chief concern of the American Family Association is the predators who will take advantage … and we have a long list of predators who have done that.”
“This is not going to stop with Target if we don’t take a very strong stand now,” Rios said. “I would say on the positive side, we’ve had other corporations come to us privately and say they’re watching. They were considering changing their policies, but they’re watching this boycott and they’re saying, you know, maybe not. Maybe we’re not going to go in that direction. So, a lot hinges on it, and this is something simple that people can do. We are in dialogue with other companies, other corporations encouraging them not to do this. And of course if they do, we’ll have to apply the same thing that we applied to Target,” she concluded.
Rios also noted: “I don’t know if people realize that the Obama Education Department has been pushing this whole thing of breaking down the barriers in the bathrooms in public school now this whole year. They are actually threatening to withhold money from schools if schools do not accommodate children, boys and girls who think they are the other gender … that they can lost their funding. So, this has been a battle by school boards. There’s a huge one that went on in fairfax, Virginia, just this past year and they lost. The parents lost.”

Police officers rushed Lennon to Manhattan's Roosevelt Hospital, 12 blocks away, in the back of a police cruiser. Hundreds of mourners gathered in the courtyard at West 59th Street and Ninth Avenue, holding vigil as they waited for a doctor to deliver news of his condition.

The scene that unfolded that night has repeated itself — with minor variations for time, location and number of victims — over and over again in the 35 years since, most recently outside a pair of hospitals in San Bernardino, California.
Some 1.15 million people have been killed by firearms in the United States since Lennon was gunned down, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. (The figure includes estimates for the two most recent years.)
Since 1968 — the year the Beatles released the White Album — more Americans have been killed by gun violence than in all U.S. wars throughout history, combined.
Hillary Clinton was in Florida last week, giving a speech citing the staggering statistics about American gun violence, as the San Bernardino shooting was taking place.
""Ninety Americans a day die from gun violence, homicide, suicides, tragic avoidable accidents — 33,000 Americans a year die,"" Clinton told the crowd. ""It is time for us to say we are going to have comprehensive background checks, we are gonna close the gun show loopholes.""
In an address delivered from the Oval Office Sunday evening, President Obama urged Congress to consider a proposal to ban gun sales to individuals on the government's no-fly list, and called for limits on assault weapons. Both proposals are supported by all three Democratic presidential candidates, and opposed by the majority of the Republican field.
Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz voted against measures that would expand background checks and prevent terror suspects on the no-fly list from acquiring guns the day after the San Bernardino shootings; those candidates have received thousands of dollars from gun rights groups this election cycle.
Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio spoke out against the measures, citing the unreliability of the no-fly list. Ohio Gov. John Kasich was the lone Republican candidate to express support for the proposed rule. ""Of course, it makes common sense to say that, if you're on a terrorist watch list, you shouldn't be able to go out and get a gun,"" Kasich said.
Earlier this year, Obama gave one of his strongest speeches yet on the broader issue of gun violence in America, in the wake of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Gun violence is ""a political choice we make,"" the president said, noting that ""we, collectively, are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.""
As of early December, there had been 353 mass shootings in 2015 so far — more mass shootings than there had been days in the year.

693651239486263296,non-rumor,"Body found in North Carolina of Virginia girl, 13, missing since Wednesday. Virginia Tech student has been charged. https://t.co/71rkC4iSZj",http://cnn.it/1OYnGhp,True,Missing teen found dead; student charged with murder,"(CNN) A Virginia Tech freshman was charged with murder Saturday night after the remains of a 13-year-old girl who disappeared from her house were found in North Carolina, authorities said.
Nicole Madison Lovell was last seen between 7 p.m. and midnight Wednesday at her home in Blacksburg, Virginia, police said.
The family found a dresser pushed against her bedroom door and said the middle-school student probably climbed out the apartment window, according to the Roanoke Times.
The family was extremely worried because Lovell required daily prescription medication for a liver transplant and didn't carry the medicine with her, according to police in Blacksburg, Virginia.
The search ended Saturday afternoon when her body was found about 100 miles away from home, Blacksburg Police Chief Anthony Wilson said.
Freshman engineering major arrested
""We were able to determine an approximate area where she might be found,"" he said. ""Virginia State Police were dispatched to the general area Saturday afternoon and she was located just inside the North Carolina border on Route 89 in Surry County.""
David E. Eisenhauer, 18, of Columbia, Maryland, was already in custody. He was arrested Saturday morning at his residence on campus and charged with felony abduction, police said. Police said they acted on tips and social media to identify him.
After the remains were found, he was charged with murder. He's being held without bond in a jail in Montgomery County, Virginia, Wilson said.
""The speed at which this investigation has moved today has been nothing less than incredible,"" Wilson said. ""We owe that to the outpouring of support and tips from the Blacksburg, Christansburg and Montgomery County communities.""
Eisenhauer is a freshman engineering major and has been a member of the Virginia Tech cross country team, the Roanoke Times reported. The university said he's been suspended.
Police didn't give a motive or say how Lovell died.
CNN is attempting to find out if Eisenhauer has retained an attorney.
""We still have a great deal to do,"" Wilson said.
'Very wounded folks'
Lovell's disappearance had gripped the picturesque town of about 40,000 people, where the university is located.
""I'm scared to death,"" her father, David Lovell, told CNN affiliate WDBJ before she was found.
Police, the family and members of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets searched for the girl, according to a statement from the school. Wilson said Lovell's body will be returned for an autopsy and authorities will work to reconstruct a timeline leading up to her death.
The university said i t is reaching out to those affected by the tragedy.
""As a father, as well as Virginia Tech's president, I want to reassure you that our community is supportive and resilient,"" Virginia Tech President Tim Sands said in an open letter. ""Lean on that support and the resources available to you. It is normal to feel anxious and overwhelmed at a time such as this. You are not alone.""
The police chief said the Blacksburg community is reeling from the girl's death.
""We have some very wounded folks in this community and and please show them some respect,"" Wilson said. ""We will continue to be very transparent with you during this investigation but please remember these are the kinds of crimes that rip communities apart.""",3322

Video provided by Newsy Newslook
A petition boycotting Target over its policy to allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice in its stores has gained nearly half a million signatures. (Photo: Damian Dovarganes, AP)
Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly referenced North Carolina's transgender bathroom law. It requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms associated with the sex on their birth certificate.
A conservative Christian activist group has gained more than half a million signatures and counting from people pledging to boycott Target over its transgender bathroom policy.
The petition started by the American Family Association on Wednesday raises concerns that Target's inclusive stance on transgender rights encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger, because ""a man can simply say he 'feels like a woman today' and enter the women's restroom.""
The boycott has more than 744,800 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon, marking it as one of AFA's most popular campaigns.
""This is the best response we’ve ever had this quick,"" says AFA President Tim Wildmon, attributing the protest's viral nature to the fact that ""everybody knows who Target is, and it’s an easy-to-understand issue.""
Wildmon says Target stands ""to lose a lot of customers who won't come back."" But Target is standing by its policy.
""We certainly respect that there are a wide variety of perspectives and opinions,"" says Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. ""As a company that firmly stands behind what it means to offer our team an inclusive place to work — and our guests an inclusive place to shop — we continue to believe that this is the right thing for Target.""
She added that hundreds of Target stores ""have single-stall, family restrooms for those who may be more comfortable with that option.""
CLOSE This marks the first time a federal appeals court has considered bathroom restrictions in light of Title IX, which could have national implications.Video provided by Newsy Newslook
Target made its position public in a blog post last week, stating that the company welcomes ""transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity."" The announcement comes as legislation on transgender issues in multiple states has spurred several major corporations and businesses to take a stance on LGBT rights.
Deutsche Bank halted a plan to add 250 jobs to an outpost of the company in North Carolina after the state passed a law requiring transgender people using public bathrooms to use the one associated with the sex on their birth certificate.
The American Family Association, a non-profit based in Tupelo, Miss., frequently protests on issues that target what it considers traditional family values.

637382230394822656,false,Ben Carson: What Happened to Blacks During Slavery is Why I am Pro-Life on Abortion Today http://t.co/H46mJNmjEm http://t.co/bGKrv9rPx8,http://bit.ly/1JraVZV,True,Ben Carson: What Happened to Blacks During Slavery is Why I am Pro-Life on Abortion Today,"On August 23rd, presidential hopeful and former pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson did an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” and said he became pro-life after thinking about how Blacks were treated during slavery. He explained, “I began to think if abolitionists a long time ago began to think that ‘I don’t believe in slavery, but anybody else can do it if they want to,’ where would we be today? So that changed my opinion of a lot of things.”
Prior to 1992, Carson believed abortion was wrong but did not want to stop a woman from making her decision. He said the following in a previous interview with CNN’s Jim Acosta: “I make no bones about the fact that I used to be a Democrat. I used to be a pretty left-wing Democrat, in fact. Over the course of time, you know, my views have changed very dramatically. I personally was against abortion, but I was not for causing anybody else to do anything, I was pro-choice, in that region [of Maryland].”
As LifeNews previously reported, in a video from 2012, Carson elaborated on his thoughts about slavery and abortion. He said, “The slave owners felt that they should be able to do whatever they wanted to do. And there were some people who were not slave owners who said, ‘You can do what you want to do, but I don’t.”
However, Carson later realized that being personally against abortion is not enough, and abortion isn’t justifiable because the baby is growing inside its mother. Carson asked, “Does that convey the right to terminate it? It doesn’t convey that right anymore than a slave owner had the right to terminate a slave.”
Additionally, in 2013, Carson shared what he believes about the supposed “war on women” at the Voters Value Summit. He said, “You know, there are those of us in this society who have told women that there’s a war on them because that cute little baby inside of them, they may want to get rid of it and there are people that are keeping you from doing that,” Carson continued. “And women say, ‘No, no, they’re not doing that to me! No!’ And they get all riled up.”
“There is no war on them, the war is on their babies, Babies that cannot defend themselves. Over the past few decades, we have destroyed 55 million of them. And we have the nerve to call other societies of the past heathen. What we need to do is re-educate the women to understand that they are the defenders of these babies.”

In July, Carson was one of the first presidential candidates to call on Congress to de-fund Planned Parenthood after undercover videos were released exposing their scandalous organ harvesting business. In fact, Carson launched an online petition urging Congress to halt funding immediately. His petition reads, “I, like many of you, was sickened when I saw the video of Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood secretly video taped discussing selling aborted babyparts. I was more than sickened, I was enraged. Congress must act NOW! Please sign my petition to Congress demanding that they stop all public funds to Planned Parenthood. I spent my whole life caring for children. What I see in this video is barbaric. Congress must ACT!”",3211

Four Chinese miners who had been trapped underground for 36 days have been rescued, Chinese state media say.
The men were trapped by a cave-in at a gypsum mine in eastern Shandong province on 25 December.
China's CCTV showed dramatic footage of one of the men appearing on the surface and then being taken to hospital.
In all, 29 people were initially trapped by the collapse: 15 have now been rescued and one confirmed dead, while 13 are still missing.

The four miners - who were detected more than 200 metres (656ft) below the ground - were led to safety late on Friday.
Local media say the men are being examined in a local hospital.
More than 400 rescue and emergency workers were in the operation.
For several weeks, they were tunnelling down to the surviving men, and water and liquids were passed down through a narrow borehole.
On Friday, the miners were winched up - one-by-one - in a specially made capsule.
Footage from inside the mine earlier showed the four men sitting together. One of them was heard saying: ""I feel relieved and secure now. We will remember you (rescuers) forever,"" CCTV reports.
Local official Zhang Shuping hailed the operation.
""What a relief,"" he said, adding that the rescued miners were in a stable condition.
Mr Zhang said the search for the miners still missing would continue and rescuers would use light detection equipment to try to locate them.
The mine collapse near the town of Pingyi in December was so violent that it registered at China's earthquake monitoring centre.

Local media later reported that police had enacted ""enforcement measures"" against several bosses at Yurong company which owns the mine, while local party officials had been sacked.
The company chairman Ma Congbo, drowned himself by jumping into a mine well several days after the incident.
China has a long history of industrial accidents. This incident came days after a landslide caused by construction waste in southern China left dozens of people missing and presumed dead.

690969315470868480,non-rumor,'Plane wreckage' found in Thailand prompts speculation it might belong to Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 - Reuters https://t.co/Wu0QS1rb5r,http://reut.rs/23kMzeG,True,Wreckage found in Thailand unlikely to come from missing Malaysian jet,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A piece of suspected plane wreckage found off the east coast of southern Thailand on Saturday was unlikely to belong to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 which vanished nearly two years ago, said aviation experts and Thai officials.
A large piece of curved metal washed ashore in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Tanyapat Patthikongpan, head of Pak Phanang district, told Reuters. Villagers reported it to authorities for identification, he said.
“Villagers found the wreckage, measuring about 2 meters wide and 3 meters long (6.6 by 9.8 feet),” he said.
The find fueled speculation in the Thai media that the debris could belong to MH370, which disappeared with 239 people on board during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. A piece of the plane washed up on the French island of Reunion in July 2015 but no further trace has been found.
Experts said that while powerful currents sweeping the Indian Ocean could deposit debris thousands of kilometers away, wreckage was extremely unlikely to have drifted across the equator into the northern hemisphere.
The location of the debris in Thailand “would appear to be inconsistent with the drift models that appeared when MH370’s flaperon was discovered in Reunion last July,” said Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor at Flightglobal, an industry publication.
“The markings, engineering, and tooling apparent in this debris strongly suggest that it is aerospace related,” said Waldron. “It will need to be carefully examined, however, to determine it’s exact origin.”
Other possible sources of aerospace debris included the launching of space rockets by India eastwards over the Bay of Bengal, he said.
There has been no official confirmation from Thailand that the wreckage belongs even to a plane, never mind the missing Malayasia jet.

“Personally, I don’t think it’s MH370,” Thai government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd told Reuters.
District head Patthikongpan said the debris “could have been under the sea for no more than a year, judging from barnacles on it.”
A spokesman for the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, the Canberra-based authority which is overseeing the international search for MH370, told Reuters it was “awaiting results of the official examination of the material.”
The Malaysian transport ministry is in contact with Thai authorities to verify the debris, a ministry spokesman said.
Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off MH370’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course. Most of the passengers were Chinese.
Lingering uncertainty surrounding its fate has tormented the families of those on board. Some have said even the discovery of debris would still not solve the mystery.
The fragment found in Thailand “just doesn’t look like aircraft fuselage,” aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas told Reuters from near Perth.

“It just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any connection with MH370 whatsoever.”",3198
666070802924617728,false,JINDAL DEMANDS INFO ABOUT REFUGEES ENTERING NEW ORLEANS... https://t.co/c9wn9rMwra,http://bit.ly/20VJ118,True,Bobby Jindal Demands Information About Obama’s Syrian Refugees Entering New Orleans,"In a letter to President Barack Obama, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal demanded information about the Syrian refugees entering his state via New Orleans.
The 2016 GOP presidential contender framed his demands in the context of the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday. He wrote:
Last week, the city of New Orleans began receiving its first wave of Syrian refugees. As with former immigration crises and federal relocation policy, Louisiana has been kept in the dark about those seeking refuge in the state. It is irresponsible and severely disconcerting to place individuals, who may have ties to ISIS, in a state without the state’s knowledge or involvement. As Governor of Louisiana, I demand information about the Syrian refugees being placed in Louisiana in hopes that the night of horror in Paris is not duplicated here.
Jindal demanded information about whether “additional protections and screenings will be put in place,” particularly following the Paris attacks and the discovery “that some of those responsible…held Syrian passports.”
Additionally, Jindal demands to know the level of background screening conducted on the Syrian refugees, and whether “all Syrian refugees seeking relocation in the United States will now be cleared by the Terrorist Screening Center?”
Finally, Jindal expects to receive information about the level of monitoring of the refugees that will be conducted once they are placed in Louisiana.
“As Americans, we embolden freedom and opportunity to the rest of the world, but by opening up our borders and refusing to collaborate or share information with states, you are threatening that reality,” Jindal writes, telling the president “it would be prudent to pause the process of refugees coming to the United States. Authorities need to investigate what happened in Europe before this problem comes to the United States.”
According to local Fox affiliate WVUE, Martin Gutierrez, a spokesman from Catholic Charities – associated with the archdiocese of New Orleans – says his organization has served two refugee families already, but expects more.
“So it’s a matter of uniting the families, which is something that the church really promotes, obviously. Some of them don’t have relatives and we try to help them become integral parts of our communities,” Gutierrez said.
Former New Orleans FBI chief and anti-terrorism expert Jim Bernazzani was interviewed by WVUE on whether terrorists coming into the country with the Syrian refugees are a legitimate concern.
“If I was in charge of ISIL, logistically I’d take advantage of this situation and put my people in, into the United States,” Bernazzani said. “Now with that said, the FBI is on top of this big time with our Joint Terrorism Task Force and we have what’s called a Terrorist Screening Center that these individuals will be run through.”
He added, however, that not every refugee entering the United States would face the same level of scrutiny.
“It’s going to be the 18- to 45-year-old male for the most part,” he said. “It’s a percentage game… it’s a percentage game.”",3073

A story in Thursday’s Washington Times saying that Joaquin Guzman, the Mexican fugitive drug trafficker known as “El Chapo,” threatened the leader of the Islamic State, is apparently a hoax that was originally picked up by a site that reports on cartel news.
ThugLifeVideos.com told the Daily Mail and Snopes.com that Steve Charnock and his boss thought up the satire and wrote it on Nov. 30. The story on ThugLifeVideos.com wasn’t labeled as a satire on Thursday, and the site’s “About” section claimed it runs “more serious content” with the “odd satire stories.” On Friday, the story carried the satire label.
ThugLifeVideos confirmed to The Times on Friday that it was a hoax.
“We work in a massive viral network of websites that writes entertainment stories, sometimes we will have the odd satire post,” Jacob Willis from ThugLifeVideos told The Times in an email. “We fully intend for them to go viral, but not make it into mainstream media, that’s why we reached out to the Daily mail [sic] to set the story straight.”
Apparently, cartelblog.com, which reports on the Mexican drug cartels, initially wrote about an email sent from Guzman to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group, saying: “Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”
Cartelblog.com attributed its information to a Mexican blogger with “intimate ties with actual Sinaloa cartel members …”
Rusty Payne, a DEA spokesperson, told Forbes on Thursday via e-mail: “I don’t have any information to weigh in either way.”
The hoax was reported by The Times and other national publications.
The Times has reached out to cartelblog.com without answer. Since Guzman is a missing fugitive drug kingpin, The Times could not call him directly to confirm the information in the original cartelblog.com post.
ORIGINAL TEXT:
Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the fugitive Mexican drug trafficker, reportedly issued a threat in an encrypted email to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group, saying: “Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”
Apparently, one of the drug kingpin’s shipments was destroyed by the Islamic State, the U.K. Mirror reported Thursday.
“My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a whore that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them,” Guzman said in an email, cartelblog.com reported.
Guzman has been a fugitive since he dug his way out of a Mexican maximum security prison and fled in an underground tunnel on July 11. This was his second escape. In 2001, he had escaped another maximum security prison in Mexico, but he was later recaptured in 2014.
Mexican officials said they thought Guzman had injured his leg and face during the latest escape through the tunnel.

French police have arrested a man carrying two guns at an entrance to a hotel at Disneyland Paris.
The man, reportedly aged 28 and not known to security services, was also discovered with a copy of the Koran and a box of ammunition, police said.
His bag triggered metal detectors as he entered the New York Hotel at the much-visited theme park.
France remains in a state of emergency declared in November after the deadly attacks by jihadist militants in Paris.
So-called Islamic State (IS) said it carried out the co-ordinated assaults that left 130 people dead.
'Routine screening'
Disneyland Paris closed briefly after the November attacks, but the theme park remained open following Thursday's incident.
""During a routine security screening checkpoint at one of our hotels, weapons were discovered in a guest's luggage through our X-ray machine,"" spokesman Francois Banon said.
""The police were immediately notified and the individual was arrested. We continue to work closely with the authorities and the safety and security of our guests and cast members is our utmost priority.""
""There was loads of security, there were sniffer dogs, which you wouldn't see in any hotel and there was security as well,"" Ronan Flaherty, who was staying at the premises at the time, told the BBC.
A police source told the AFP news agency that a preliminary investigation did not point to terrorism, and that the man had said he was carrying the weapons because he feared for his safety.
Disneyland Paris
First opened in 1992 and located in Marne-la-Vallee, a town about 30km (18 miles) east of Paris.
Had about 10 million visitors in 2014 and calls itself the most visited tourist destination in Europe
92% of its guests are from Europe, with 49% from France, 16% from the UK and 9% from Spain.
Hosts about 1,000 business events each year
In July, the EU began an inquiry into the theme park, following accusations that UK and German customers were frozen out of certain promotions.
Sources: Disneyland Paris, European Commission, Global Attractions Attendance Report
Papers found on the suspect indicated that he lived in Paris, the source added.
He reportedly co-manages a brasserie in the French capital.
""For me, it's a mistake,"" said a member of the bar staff.
Police also arrested a woman, believing her to be the man's girlfriend, but later released her when they realised they had got the wrong woman, French media reported.
The interior ministry said police were still searching for a woman who might have been with the man, according to the Reuters news agency.
President Francois Hollande is seeking to extend France's three-month state of emergency for another three months, despite opposition from human rights groups.
Earlier this week, European Union policing agency Europol warned that IS was planning further attacks, with France and so-called ""soft"" targets at particular risk.",3014

In a statement that surprised even his critics, Mr Erdogan responded to arguments that putting political power in the hands of the presidency would not work in a ""unitary state"".
He said there were other examples of its being successful. ""There are already examples in the world,” he said.
“You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany. There are later examples in various other countries.""
The Turkish presidency at present is largely ceremonial, with most powers in the hands of the prime minister. However, when he was prevented constitutionally from standing as prime minister for a fourth election last year, Mr Erdogan stood for the presidency instead, and has used the position to continue his aggressive Islamist agenda.
In the meantime, he has been trying to change the constitution to formalise the situation.
Local critics used his words to argue he was becoming dictatorial, but in Israel they will be seen as another example of political insensitivity. Mr Erdogan has clashed with Israel on a number of occasions over his perceived support for Islamist, anti-Israel groups.
Online, Turks, bloggers and Middle East analysts all took to Twitter to express their astonishment.
Eliot Higgins, who has achieved celebrity status for his analysis of weapons usage in the Syrian war, said Mr Erdogan had achieved a first by managing to ""Godwin"" himself. ""Godwin's Law"" is a joke rule of the internet which states that anyone who compares someone else to Hitler in an online argument has lost.

no idea how to say ""jumped the shark"" in Turkish, but #Turkey pres Erdogan praising Hitler's presidential system as model surely qualifies — Richard N. Haass (@RichardHaass) January 1, 2016
Officials immediately tried to argue that Mr Erdogan’s words had been taken out of context.
They pointed out his subsequent comments, in which he said the important thing was not the type of system but whether it ruled with justice.
""What is important is that a presidential system should not disturb the people in its implementation,” he said. “If you provide justice, there will be no problem because what people want and expect is justice.""
The day before, Mr Erdogan’s replacement as prime minister, seemed to say the opposite, defending the proposed changes by saying that in Germany a parliamentary system had been used by Hitler in his rise to power.
""There are authoritarian structures coming out of parliamentary systems,” he said. “Hitler’s Germany was born out of a parliamentary system.""",2996

While agents are taking the alleged threat — forewarned by hacktivist group Anonymous — seriously, they do not “have specific or credible information"" that the Philips Arena wrestling match is a target, the FBI said in a statement.
“We have, however, made the proper notifications as we continue to work closely with our law enforcement and private sector partners to keep our community safe,” the statement read.
Anonymous claimed it uncovered the veiled threat days after declaring cyber war on the terror network.

Fighters are planning an assault on WWE’s Survivor Series, Anonymous said in a statement. The wrestling event is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Atlanta’s Philips Arena.
The wrestling match will go on, WWE officials said.
“WWE Survivor Series is currently scheduled as planned while we investigate the matter with federal, state and local authorities,"" WWE said in a statement.
The Survivor Series, first held in 1987, is one of WWE’s four original pay-per-view wrestling competitions. This year’s event features seven face-offs including the Diva’s Championship match and a tag team match that puts four wrestlers in the same ring.
ISIS (Al-Hayat Media Center) WWE (Joern Pollex/Bongarts/Getty Images) Islamic State terrorists are reportedly targeting a Sunday World WWE event.
The Atlanta attack is just one of a slew of ISIS-led rampages allegedly set for Sunday. The terrorists also plotted out attacks at concerts, colleges and churches in Europe and Asia, Anonymous said.
Possible terror targets include a Five Finger Death Punch heavy metal concert in Milan, Feast of Christ the King celebrations in Rome, University Pastoral Day at Lebanon’s Holy Spirit University, an event at Al-Jihad mosque in Indonesia and two music shows in Paris.
Anonymous provided no further details about the attacks.
The hackers said they submitted proof of the plans to the appropriate authorities days ago.

“But because they have not done anything with it yet and it's almost the 22nd, we have taken matters into our hands,” the group said in the statement, which served as a warning to anyone planning to attend one of the targeted events.
Anonymous announced it was waging a cyber war against the terrorists last week after ISIS took responsibility for a wave of attacks that killed 130 people in Paris.
“Expect massive cyber-attacks,” a voice said in a video announcing the planned hackings on ISIS. “War is declared. Get prepared. Anonymous from all over the world will hunt you down.”

A special court is being set up in The Hague to try war crimes committed during the 1999-2000 war in Kosovo, the Dutch government says.
It will try serious crimes allegedly committed by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) against ethnic minorities and political opponents, a statement said.
The court is set to begin operating later this year.
The conflict pitted ethnic Albanian rebels against Serbian forces.
Until 2008, Kosovo was a province of Serbia. Years of tensions turned into open conflict in 1998, when the Serbian government launched a crackdown.
It eventually withdrew its troops from Kosovo after a two-month campaign of air strikes by Nato in 1999.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, although Serbia has never recognised this.
An estimated 10,000 people died in the conflict and about 1,700 remain missing.
Tribunal could prove vital, by Guy Delauney, BBC News, Belgrade
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Kosovo Albanians, who hold former KLA commanders in high regard, have protested against the new court
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has tried and convicted many Serb officials over the past two decades, but it has generally failed to find justice for hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs who were themselves the victims of forced displacements or atrocities.
This has damaged the ICTY's credibility, especially in Serbia, and hampered reconciliation efforts.
Officially, the new tribunal will be a national court of Kosovo, despite its location in The Hague.
But it should finally deal with the long-festering allegations that members of the KLA - many of whom have risen to high positions in the government - committed atrocities.
Members of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority who view the KLA as heroes may resent the process. But the tribunal might prove vital, as Serbia and Kosovo continue efforts to normalise relations.
The Dutch statement admits that trying war crimes ""is a sensitive issue in Kosovo"".
""Possible suspects may be seen by sections of Kosovan society as freedom fighters, and witnesses may feel threatened in Kosovo,"" hence the reason for cases to be heard abroad.
""It is important for justice to be done,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said.
""So we are pleased to be able to offer the court a home.""
A 2011 report from the Council of Europe, which monitors human rights, accused KLA rebels of serious crimes, including the trafficking of prisoners' organs.
Parliament in Kosovo approved the creation of the tribunal last year, despite protests and an opposition boycott of the vote.
Kosovan Albanians make up about 90% of the population, and tensions remain with the Serb minority.
Earlier this month anti-government protesters clashed with police in a demonstration against a deal giving more power to ethnic Serbs.",2955

But it wasn't a joke -- and neither was its $5.99 price tag.
When shopper Marielle Wakim, an associate editor at Los Angeles magazine, spotted the water sitting on shelves in a California Whole Foods supermarket, she had to stop to do a double take.
""Somewhere in L.A., Whole Foods executives are laughing at all of us,"" she wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of the so-called ""Asparagus Water"" product.
Marielle Wakim/Los Angeles Magazine
More than 100 people liked the photo, which quickly spread online.
As an L.A. resident, Wakim is used to health food trends like kale soft-serve or ""Swole Cakes,"" but this product struck her as ridiculous.
""Tap water, after all, is free, and an entire bundle of asparagus from Whole Foods costs around $5,"" Wakim said. ""In fact, I was half-sure it was a joke.""
Apparently, Twitter users did, too.
""You could buy a knitting pattern for $6 that takes HOURS of labor to produce, or you could spend same $6 on a bottle of ASPARAGUS WATER,"" one user tweeted.
""If any of you ever catch me buying a $6 bottle of ""asparagus water"" at Whole Foods - or anywhere - you are free to punch me on sight,"" another responded.
After thousands of people took to the Internet to discuss ""Asparagus Water(gate),"" Whole Foods addressed the outlandish item.
""We actually don't sell asparagus water in our stores,"" Whole Foods Market Senior Media Relations Specialist Liz Burkhart told CBS News. ""We looked into the item as soon as it was brought to our attention.""
The water was ""carried briefly"" in just one store in Brentwood, California, but it has now been removed.
""It was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms (similar to bone broth), which is typically made over a long period of time soaking in water,"" Burkhart explained. ""It was made incorrectly and has since been removed.""
Whole Foods has been under scrutiny for over-pricing and mislabeling ever since New York City's consumer chief released details on an investigation in June that showed the chain's supermarkets have been routinely overcharging customers by overstating the weight of prepackaged meat, dairy and baked goods.
Wakim was relieved to hear that ""Asparagus Water"" was just a ""snafu"" on the grocer's part.
""I'm sure people who saw it experienced some sort of sticker shock ($6 for a bottle of water?!) combined with disbelief that such a thing would even exist,"" she said.
Fortunately, for Wakim -- and other shoppers who got caught up in the great ""Asparagus Water"" debate -- it no longer does.

Previously uninterpreted data showing vertical movement of the fault’s crust detected several millimeters of uplift and subsidence in surface areas as large as 125 miles.
While these hotspots were predicted in models before, this is the first time scientists were able to block out white noise and other diluting factors such as precipitation and local surface geology.

A 2005 study published in the journal Nature found the fault had reached a sufficient level of stress for an earthquake of a magnitude greater than 7.0, with the risk concentrated on the area of the fault near Los Angeles.
According to the new research, scientists will be able to study and understand the behavior of faults, even when dormant, using the vertical readings in the hope of predicting activity.
Emergency services will also benefit from more accurate seismic hazard estimates, predicting where on the surface movement is more likely to occur when ‘The Big One’ eventually strikes.

Wrong.
Some are livid that the company is trying something different — and that the phrase ""Merry Christmas"" is nowhere to be found on the cups.

Kelly McCreary, who joined the cast in Season 11 as Meredith's (Ellen Pompeo) half-sister Maggie, tells TVGuide.com that creator Shonda Rhimes plans to take deep dives into the characters of Meredith, Alex (Justin Chambers), Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) in the upcoming season.
""After such a long period of time and so many new people coming in and out, they remain the foundational characters of the show,"" McCreary says. ""We're gonna be spending some more time with them to check in with where they are. The way that we spent time with Meredith last season, exploring the major shift in her life, the loss of Derek, I think we can expect to see those doctors being explored where they are in this moment, all these years later, the changes that they've gone through.""
Grey's Anatomy Mega Buzz: Will Riggs come between Maggie and Meredith?
Does that mean we'll get to catch up with other original characters — like, say, Izzie (Katherine Heigl) or Cristina (Sandra Oh)? There's no official word on whether Heigl or Oh will return to the show, but at least in Izzie's case, now would be a perfectly inconvenient time for her to pop back up into Alex's life. It's a safe bet that Alex's Season 13 storyline will revolve around the fallout from Jo's (Camilla Luddington) revelation that she's already married and has been living under an alias to hide from her abusive husband — not to mention that beatdown we saw Alex giving DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti) in the Season 12 finale.

As for Meredith, Season 13 will find her and Maggie exploring their new sisterly dynamic now that newlywed Amelia (Caterina Scorsone) has moved out of the house, and the drama that ensues when Maggie finds out that Meredith and Riggs (Martin Henderson) are involved. Bailey will continue to represent the ups and downs of long-term relationships through her marriage to Ben (Jason George). Developments for Webber remain to be seen, but he's due up for a big, dramatic arc, and it's a safe bet that Rhimes will deliver.
Of course, this isn't to say that the newer characters won't get any of the spotlight. For starters, April (Sarah Drew) and Jackson (Jesse Williams) will learn how to co-parent while trying to figure out their own relationship, and Amelia and Owen (Kevin McKidd) have to navigate married life. But fans who have been with the show since Season 1 can expect to see the Grey's veterans front and center.
""One of the things I'm looking forward to most is the focus on ... those old, established relationships and those characters,"" McCreary says. ""Those characters are so rich and they have so much meaning for our audience. I think it'll be wonderful to spend some more time with them.""

Her parents moved to the United States when she was a year old in search of better economic opportunities and sent for her a decade later.
She became an American teenager, and eventually a noted photographer, but she never forgot the years she spent with her grandmother. So in 1995, when she heard a radio report about Korean women forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese Army during World War II, she took on the subject as her next personal project.
Thousands of Korean women were lured or coerced to work in brothels serving the Japanese Army during the 1930s and 1940s, but stigma kept the topic from being widely discussed after the war. By the time Ms. Kim heard the radio report, some women had come forward to tell of their ordeals and demand that Japan take responsibility for what happened to them.
“I could relate to going to a foreign land for economic reasons and to send money to their homeland,” Ms. Kim said. “This is very sensitive to every family in Korea because it could have happened to their own daughter.”
Ms. Kim went back to South Korea, recording the stories of four women who lived together in a basement apartment in Seoul.
“They cared for each other and supported each other, like a sorority,” she said.
Ms. Kim visited the women regularly, hearing their painful descriptions of being recruited to work in factories or to help wounded soldiers in Japan, but then being forced to work in brothels throughout the South Pacific. They told of being tortured and having to service 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers a day.
At the time, the stories of what were euphemistically called “comfort women” were just beginning to become public. In 1996, Ms. Kim’s photo essay was published around the world and helped bring broader understanding of what the women went through.
In the decades since, South Korea and Japan have vigorously debated Japan’s responsibility for what the women endured. On Monday the nations’ foreign ministers announced an agreement to resolve their dispute. Japan made an apology and promised an $8.3 million payment.
While each side said it was a “final and irrevocable resolution,” some of the 46 surviving comfort women criticized the agreement. In a news conference, Lee Yong-soo, 88, one of the women, said the deal fell far short of their demand that Japan admit legal responsibility and offer reparations.
On Monday Ms. Kim was still trying to get details of the agreement but said it was “going in the right direction.”
“What’s important to the comfort women is whether the Japanese textbooks and history books will mention the comfort women accurately,” she said. “People need to know what really happened.”

Turkey’s president has been pushing for some time for a new presidential system to govern the country, sparring with critics who accuse him of attempting a power grab.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s latest comments in favour of greater executive powers are unlikely to help him bring those critics round. On Friday he was quoted by Turkish media as citing a striking example of an effective presidential system – Germany under Adolf Hitler.
Asked on his return from a visit to Saudi Arabia whether an executive presidential system was possible while maintaining the unitary structure of the state, he said: “There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler’s Germany.
Erdoğan plan for super-presidency puts Turkey's democracy at stake Read more
“There are later examples in various other countries,” he told reporters, according to a recording broadcast by the Dogan news agency and reported by Reuters.
A Turkish official sought to clarify Erdoğan’s remark. “There are good and poor examples of presidential systems and the important thing is to put checks and balances in place,” he said. “Nazi Germany, lacking proper institutional arrangements, was obviously one of the most disgraceful examples in history.”
The presidency said in a statement that: “Erdogan’s ‘Hitler’s Germany’ metaphor has been distorted by some news sources and has been used in the opposite sense.”
Erdoğan wants to change the constitution to turn the ceremonial role of president into that of a chief executive, a Turkish version of the system in the US, France and Russia.
The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), which he founded, has put a new constitution at the heart of its agenda after winning back a majority in parliamentary elections in November.
It reached agreement with the main opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) on Wednesday to revive efforts to forge a new constitution.
Opposition parties agree on the need to change the constitution, drawn up after a 1980 coup and still bearing the stamp of its military authors, but they do not back the presidential system Erdoğan, fearing it would consolidate too much power in the hands of an authoritarian leader.
The statement from the presidency said his comments were meant to demonstrate that an executive presidency can exist in a unitary state and does not depend on a federal system of government, and that neither a presidential nor parliamentary system is a guarantee against abuse of power.
“If the system is abused it may lead to bad management resulting in disasters as in Hitler’s Germany ... The important thing is to pursue fair management that serves the nation,” the statement said, adding it was unacceptable to suggest Erdogan was casting Hitler’s Germany in a positive light.",2902

Twitter user Layla Dhere (@dhere) expressed confusion in a recent tweet featuring the above image of a row of bottles of what is labeled ""Asparagus Water"" on a shelf. The bottles appear to be filled with water and three stalks of raw asparagus. They are priced at $5.99 each. Dhere is right to be perplexed.
""The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.""
The labels say ""Whole Foods,"" and the date on the bottles is current. A call to the supermarket (these particular bottles are from the Whole Foods in Brentwood, Calif. though in the New York City area grocery delivery service Instacart, which is a partner of Whole Foods, lists ""Asparagus Water"") at first produced some bewilderment. The operator denied the product existed. Eventually she transferred the call to a gentleman in the produce department who did not want to give his name. He explained that the product was new, ""We've had them on the shelf for the last few days."" When asked how the item is made, he said, ""It's water, and we sort of cut asparagus stalks down so they're shorter, and put them into the container."" When Eater asked what it was for, there was a long pause before he said, ""Well, it's... to drink."" He elaborated, ""The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.""
As a point of comparison, Whole Foods has whole bundles of asparagus on sale for about $5.
A search for ""Asparagus Water"" doesn't turn up any recipes or news articles; it's seemingly not a common item. And the Whole Foods employees Eater spoke with said it was not a product that had been requested by customers. Eater has reached out to Whole Foods' corporate office for comment. Perhaps Whole Foods' Asparagus Water will be sold for $3.99 at its new lower-priced 365 markets.
But maybe the pricey grocer is ahead of the game and vegetable water is the new bone broth? Or, Whole Foods is trolling its own employees, and ripping off customers as usual.
Update 8/3/15; 6:20 p.m. EST: Whole Foods' Senior Media Relations Specialist Liz Burkhart responded to Eater's request for comment by explaining that it was all a big misunderstanding:
""We appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We looked into this right away and found that this item was being carried in just one of our stores in California. It was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms to be used as broth (similar to a bone broth), which are typically made over a long period of time soaking in water. The product was made incorrectly and has since been removed from the one store where it was carried. We read your story, and would love your help clarifying that this product isn't and never has been available for online ordering on Instacart and was only ever offered in one store.""

But he later backed away from those comments amid criticism from rivals in both parties.
The initial exchange came as MSNBC’s Chris Matthews tried to pin Trump down on his views about abortion in an interview which aired Wednesday night. Matthews asked the Republican presidential frontrunner, “How do you ban abortion? How do you actually do it?”
After reiterating his stance of being “pro-life” multiple times, Trump said, “You know you’ll go back to a position like where they had where people perhaps will go to illegal places… But you have to ban it.”
Matthews pressed Trump on what should happen to women who get abortions under a future ban—the candidate has called for making a commitment to reversing the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision a litmus test for appointing justices. “There has to be some form of punishment,” Trump said, but that he has “not determined what the punishment would be.”
Matthews asked if the man who got the woman pregnant would be legally responsible: “I would say no,” Trump responded.
Shortly after a segment of the interview was published online Wednesday afternoon, Trump released a statement, saying the “issue is unclear and should be put back into the states for determination.” The candidate then released another statement walking back his comments on punishing women who have abortions.
“If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,” Trump said in the second statement. “The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed—like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.”
Republican candidates who oppose abortion rights usually advocate legal repercussions for doctors and medical providers who actually perform abortions but not for women. But Trump, who once described himself as “very pro-choice” and says he has since “evolved” on the issue, was clearly less comfortable under questioning.
Other candidates in the race for president immediately jumped on Trump’s initial comments. Brian Phillips, an aide on Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign, returned to Cruz’s common line of attack that Trump isn’t a true social conservative:
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, when asked to react to Trump’s comments, said “of course women shouldn’t be punished” for having abortions:
And Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton called Trump’s stance “horrific”:
Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also weighed in:",2847

Up to 100 masked men, dressed in black, gathered in central Stockholm to attack people from immigrant backgrounds, reports say.
Swedish police say the large gang distributed leaflets inciting people to assault refugees.
Witnesses said the men physically attacked people they believed were foreigners. However, police have not confirmed these reports.
It comes amid heightened tension in Sweden over the migrant crisis.
Some 163,000 migrants applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015, the highest per capita number in Europe.
According to Aftonbladet newspaper, the men in Stockholm were distributing leaflets on Friday evening with the slogan ""It's enough now!"",
The material threatened to give ""the North African street children who are roaming around"" the ""punishment they deserve.""
The newspaper published a video showing the gang clashing with police at Stockholm's central station.
Knuckledusters
Stockholm police said in a statement (in Swedish) that the group was handing out leaflets with the intention to incite people to carry out crimes.
One man was arrested after punching an officer in the face. Several others were detained on public order offences and another was found with brass knuckledusters, police said. All had been released by the following morning.
Image copyright TV4 Image caption Police apparently clashed with masked men outside Stockholm central station
Spokeswoman Towe Haegg told Swedish radio police had not received any reports of violence against people from migrant backgrounds.
However, Aftonbladet interviewed one 16-year-old who said he had been hit in the face near Stockholm's central station. The newspaper also quoted another witness who said he had seen men beating up people who appeared to have a foreign background in the middle of the city's Sergelstorg square.
The men were wearing arm bands of various colours and have been reportedly linked to football hooligan gangs.
There were scuffles on Saturday between pro and anti-migrant demonstrators, during which witnesses say foreigners were assaulted.
Tensions have increased after a 22-year-old employee was stabbed to death at a centre for young asylum seekers earlier this week. A 15-year-old asylum seeker was arrested in Molndal, near Gothenburg, over the murder.
Along with Germany, Sweden is a prime destination for refugees and illegal migrants entering the EU.
More than one million refugees and migrants travelled to Europe last year, most fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The numbers arriving in Sweden have fallen significantly since it imposed tighter border controls this year.
On Thursday, Interior Minister Anders Ygeman said the country would prepare to deport up to 80,000 migrants whose asylum applications were rejected.",2790

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.
According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”
Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.
The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility had previously accepted one shipment of Ebola waste in 2014 from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.
Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”
Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”
A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.",2738

A study published in 2013 by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University stoked anxieties when it found that 47% of jobs in America were vulnerable to automation. Machines are mastering ever more intricate tasks, such as translating texts or diagnosing illnesses. Robots are also becoming capable of manual labour that hitherto could be carried out only by dexterous humans.
Yet America is the high ground when it comes to automation, according to a new report* from the same pair along with other authors. The proportion of threatened jobs is much greater in poorer countries: 69% in India, 77% in China and as high as 85% in Ethiopia. There are two reasons. First, jobs in such places are generally less skilled. Second, there is less capital tied up in old ways of doing things. Driverless taxis might take off more quickly in a new city in China, for instance, than in an old one in Europe.

Attracting investment in labour-intensive manufacturing has been a route to riches for many developing countries, including China. But having a surplus of cheap labour is becoming less of a lure to manufacturers. An investment in industrial robots can be repaid in less than two years. This is a particular worry for the poor and underemployed in Africa and India, where industrialisation has stalled at low levels of income—a phenomenon dubbed “premature deindustrialisation” by Dani Rodrik of Harvard University.
Rich countries have more of the sorts of jobs that are harder for machines to replicate—those that require original ideas (creating advertising), or complex social interactions (arguing a case in court), or a blend of analysis and dexterity (open-heart surgery). But poorer countries are not powerless. Just because a job is deemed at risk from automation, it does not necessarily mean it will be replaced soon, notes Mr Frey.
The cheapness of labour in relation to capital affects the rate of automation. Passing laws that make it less costly to hire and fire workers is likely to slow its advance. Scale also matters: farms in many poor countries are often too small to benefit from machines that have been around for decades. Consumer preferences are a third barrier. Mr Burr is hardly alone in hating automated checkouts, which explains why 3m cashiers are still employed in America.",2723

Japan's Economy Minister Akira Amari has said he is resigning amid corruption allegations.
Mr Amari unexpectedly made the announcement at a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday.
But he again denied personally receiving bribes from a construction company, as had been alleged by a Japanese magazine.
The development will be seen as a significant blow for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Mr Amari, who has been minister of state for economic and fiscal policy since late 2012, has been widely described as one of Mr Abe's most trusted members of parliament.
As Japan's lead negotiator for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, Mr Amari was expected to travel to New Zealand next week to sign the agreement.
He was also regarded as the architect of Abenomics - Mr Abe's plan to pull the world's third largest economy out of deflation.
""This is possibly the biggest scandal the Abe administration has faced,"" said the BBC's Mariko Oi.

""His resignation will probably raise even more questions over Mr Abe's economic policies - or Abenomics,"" our correspondent added.
""It may also raise further opposition within Japan to the TPP.""
Mr Amari will be replaced by Nobuteru Ishihara, formerly the country's environment minister.
'I'm no exception'
A local magazine had reported last week that Mr Amari and his aides were given money and gifts worth some 12m yen ($101,000; £70,500) by a construction company in return for some favours linked to land ownership.
Mr Amari said he did receive money which he wanted declared as a political donation, however, he said some of it was mishandled by his staff.
Japan's economy, which has been struggling with deflation for nearly two decades, avoided a technical recession in the three months to September last year.
""Japan is finally emerging from deflation,"" Mr Amari told the press conference, as reported by Reuters.
""We need to pass legislation through parliament for steps to beat deflation and create a strong economy as soon as possible.
""Anything that hampers this must be eliminated, and I'm no exception,"" Reuters reported him as saying.
""I, therefore, would like to resign as minister to take responsibility [for what my aide has done],"" he said, according to Reuters.

“President Obama has ordered flags at the White House and other public buildings to fly at half-staff after mounting criticism over the delay in honoring five armed forces members killed last week by a gunman,” reports Politico.
Numerous conservatives expressed confusion at why Obama had not ordered the flag to be lowered like he had after previous mass shootings. Various governors across the country had already given the order.
As we reported last week, before Obama even took time out to honor the dead Marines – who were gunned down by an Islamic extremist – or comment on the shooting at all, he sent out a statement lecturing Americans about how Islam was a religion of peace that needed to be respected, prompting a furious reaction.
Several Twitter users also noted the discrepancy about the flag lowering.

693181857261719553,non-rumor,NFL: Diagnosed concussions rose by nearly 32 percent this season. https://t.co/0gOO1plqOe https://t.co/9CWRyVuAF2,http://es.pn/1SgKa1m,True,NFL says diagnosed concussions way up this season,"Kevin Seifert explains how the NFL will respond to the increase of diagnosed concussions from the 2015 season. (2:38)
Diagnosed concussions rose by nearly 32 percent in the NFL this season, according to data released Friday by the league.
The 2015 total was 271, a figure that includes all preseason and regular-season games as well as all practices since the start of training camp. The league had previously boasted of a decrease in reported concussions in both 2014 (206) and 2013 (229), a drop the league attributed to an enhanced concussion protocol it implemented after the 2012 season. There had been 261 concussions in 2012.
The NFL says reported concussions in regular-season games rose 58 percent from 2014 to 2015 -- the highest number (182) in any of the past four years.
Of the 271 concussions in 2015, 234 occurred in games and 37 in practice. The report, conducted by Quintiles Injury Surveillance and Analytics, listed the following as the most common causes during regular-season games:
Contact with another helmet (92)
Contact with the playing surface (29)
Contact with a shoulder (23)
Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president of health and safety policy, said during a conference call the league will study what might have caused the incidence of head injuries to rise so much this season.
Among the possible explanations Miller mentioned were a doubling in the number of players screened for possible concussions, ""unprecedented levels of players reporting signs and signals of concussions,"" and the fact that trainers who work as spotters or independent neurologists on sidelines ""are much more actively participating in identifying this injury.""
Rather than a discussion about the possibility that there were simply more concussions this season and what could have led to that, the emphasis during Friday's call was on what the league and doctors touted as more efficient identification of head injuries during games.
""I see coaches report players and pull them out of the game. I see players report themselves. I see players report each other,"" said Richard Ellenbogen, co-chairman of the NFL's head, neck and spine committee.
""Clearly,"" Ellenbogen added, ""we've lowered the threshold for diagnosing concussion, for pulling players out and evaluating them.""
Meanwhile, the league also reported an increase in knee injuries to the ACL and MCL. According to the data, ACL injuries rose from 49 last season to 56 in 2015 but were still lower than the 62 from 2013. There were 170 MCL injuries in 2015, up from 139 last season, 136 in 2013 and 132 in 2012.

Five black and Latino teenagers were arrested.
Trump stepped in, denounced Mayor Ed Koch’s call for peace and bought full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty. The five teenagers spent years in prison before being exonerated. In retrospect, they suffered a modern version of a lynching, and Trump played a part in whipping up the crowds.
As Trump moved into casinos, discrimination followed. In the 1980s, according to a former Trump casino worker, Kip Brown, who was quoted by The New Yorker: “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. … They put us all in the back.”
In 1991, a book by John O’Donnell, who had been president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump as criticizing a black accountant and saying: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” O’Donnell wrote that for months afterward, Trump pressed him to fire the black accountant, until the man resigned of his own accord.
Trump eventually denied making those comments. But in 1997 in a Playboy interview, he conceded “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”
The recent record may be more familiar: Trump’s suggestions that President Obama was born in Kenya; his insinuations that Obama was admitted to Ivy League schools only because of affirmative action; his denunciations of Mexican immigrants as, “in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists”; his calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States; his dismissal of an American-born judge of Mexican ancestry as a Mexican who cannot fairly hear his case; his reluctance to distance himself from the Ku Klux Klan in a television interview; his retweet of a graphic suggesting that 81 percent of white murder victims are killed by blacks (the actual figure is about 15 percent); and so on.
Trump has also retweeted messages from white supremacists or Nazi sympathizers, including two from an account called @WhiteGenocideTM with a photo of the American Nazi Party’s founder.
Trump repeatedly and vehemently denies any racism, and he has deleted some offensive tweets. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi racist website that has endorsed Trump, sees that as going “full-wink-wink-wink.”",2650

North Korea may be preparing a rocket launch, US officials say, citing increased activity around the Sohae Satellite Launching Station.
One official told the AFP news agency that the launch might be ""for a satellite or a space vehicle"".
But nothing indicated it would be for a ballistic missile, the official added.
It comes as the UN Security Council discusses imposing fresh sanctions against North Korea after it conducted a fourth nuclear test on 6 January.
Pyongyang said it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, but nuclear experts have questioned the claim, saying the blast was not large enough.
'A lot of guesses'
On Thursday morning, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that Japanese officials were concerned by recent activity at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, also known as Tongchang-ri.
Analysis of satellite imagery suggested preparations were under way for a missile or rocket launch, possibly within a week, the officials said.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency meanwhile cited a government source as saying screens had been set up at key areas at the site, probably to deter satellite surveillance.
Later, an unnamed US official in Washington told AFP: ""The indications are that they are preparing for some kind of launch.
""Could be for a satellite or a space vehicle - there are a lot of guesses.
""North Korea does this periodically - they move things back and forth... There's nothing to indicate it's ballistic-missile related.""

Last year, a taller launch tower was erected at the site, in what experts said might be preparation for firing a long-range rocket.
The North last conducted a long-range rocket launch in December 2012, successfully putting into orbit an object Pyongyang claimed was a communications satellite with the three-stage Unha-3 carrier.
The US and its allies viewed the launch as a disguised test of ballistic missile technology.
The UN Security Council subsequently found that it was ""a clear violation"" of resolutions banning such tests and imposed new sanctions.
North Korea has said its space programme is peaceful, but it is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could strike the US.
It is also working to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit on a missile.",2600
614614133410033664,true,The White House goes rainbow to celebrate Supreme Court marriage ruling http://t.co/fhiAe74Gyk http://t.co/2A6CnwgGvX,http://nbcnews.to/1KgQVKF,True,Landmark: Supreme Court Rules Same-Sex Marriage Legal Nationwide,"A total of 36 states now permit gay couples to get married, covering roughly 70 percent of the US population. Today's ruling means the bans must end in the other 14 states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.
President Barack Obama, speaking from the White House just after the ruling, called the decision a ""victory for America.""
""When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free,"" the president said.
After sundown on Friday, the White House celebrated the ruling by projecting rainbow-colored lights onto the house's exterior.
Obama's own views on the matter of same-sex marriage have evolved and he has pushed increasingly for issues of gay rights in his second term.
From the White House Rose Garden, he said that social progress sometimes is slow, “and then there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.”
Those at the heart of the case said they recognized the historical significance of the decision.
“Today’s ruling affirms what millions of people across this country already know to be true in our hearts: Our love is equal” Jim Obergefell, the lead plantiff in the landmark case said outside of the Supreme Court after the ruling. “It is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past. It will simply be marriage. And our nation will be better for it.”
The president called Obergefell to congratulate him shortly after the decision was announced. Obergefell took the call while he was being interviewed live on CNN.
“Your leadership on this changed the country,” Obama told him.
The decision capped a remarkably quick turnaround in public and judicial acceptance of same-sex marriage. In the past 18 months, court rulings struck down marriage bans in rapid succession — nearly 60 separate decisions in more than half the states.

Today's ruling overturned a decision from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, which said states had legitimate reasons for maintaining the traditional definition of marriage. The appeals court also said it would be better ""to allow change through the customary political processes"" instead of the courts.
Public opinion has shifted dramatically in recent years. The first Gallup poll on the subject showed only 27 percent approval for same-sex marriage in 1996. Gallup's most recent poll, taken last month, showed 60 percent approval.",2599

And Hillary Clinton isn’t clarifying, nor is her team responding to questions about her husband honoring the flag as Arkansas governor in 1987.
TheBlaze left phone and email messages with the Clinton campaign Monday inquiring whether the button, and other similar designs sold on eBay, was part of the official campaign of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
TheBlaze also asked if the former Arkansas first lady opposed now or opposed then an act signed by her husband honoring the Confederate flag. The Clinton campaign did not respond to either question.
The Confederate battle flag has become an issue following last week’s shooting massacre at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The Confederate flag is still flown on the South Carolina Capitol grounds. After increasing calls for its removal, Gov. Nikki Haley (R) on Monday called for the flag to finally come down.
Republican presidential candidates were reluctant to take a firm stand on the matter over the weekend. Hillary Clinton spoke about race relations on Friday in San Francisco, but did not mention the Confederate flag, according to the campaign’s transcript. Clinton did, however, call for the flag to be removed from the South Carolina capitol in 2007 during her first presidential campaign.
As for the 1992 buttons, the Washington Post speculated on whether they were part of the official 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign.
One indicator that it isn’t official is that it lacks a union “bug,” the little marker showing that a piece of campaign material was printed in a union shop. If you look at other Clinton-Gore buttons, nearly all — but not all — have a bug somewhere … The politics then were less complicated than they are now. It’s believable that Clinton and Gore might have had a Confederate button, though we don’t know for sure that they did. What the reemergence of the buttons now shows, if nothing else, is that the history of the rebellious South continues to resonate and continues to evolve, year by year, as a component of American politics.
In 1987, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton signed Act 116. It had little consequences other than to reaffirm the state’s language that honored the stars on the Arkansas flag as commemorating the Confederate flag. The act specifically says, “The blue star above the word ‘ARKANSAS’ is to commemorate the Confederate States of America.”

A food testing authority using cutting-edge genetic testing has found human DNA in some samples of hot dogs, and meat was found in a shocking number of vegetarian substitutes.
Clear Food, a company that genetically tests food products, analyzed 345 hot dogs and sausages from 75 different brands, and found that 14 percent had hygienic issues or had ingredients that were not displayed on the product label.
Two percent of the samples tested positive for human DNA, and a whopping 66 percent of vegetarian hot dogs contained evidence of such contamination.
“One thing's certain: questions about the hot dog are as old as the hot dog itself. And they're not wholly unwarranted,” the report said.

Other shocking findings involved vegetarian meat substitute products. Ten percent of vegetarian hot dogs and sausages were found to contain meat. Evidence of chicken was found in 10 samples, beef in four samples, turkey in three samples, and lamb in two samples that were supposed to be meat-free.
Pork is a particular concern as an unlabeled substituted ingredient, due to dietary prohibitions in Islam and Judaism. Pork substitution was reported to be an issue in products across the price spectrum being sold at a wide variety of retailers. Clear Food found pork substitution in 3 percent of the samples that were tested. In most cases, pork found its way into chicken and turkey sausages.

Reuters In April, a BMW racing through a fruit market in Foshan in China's Guangdong province knocked down a 2-year-old girl and rolled over her head. As the girl's grandmother shouted, ""Stop! You've hit a child!"" the BMW's driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl. The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time. When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: ""Don't say that I was driving the car,"" she said. ""Say it was my husband. We can give you money.""
It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true — it's fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: ""It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.""
This 2008 television report features security-camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat's back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Security-camera footage. Screen grab Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother's body. He then speeds away from her corpse.
Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao's claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for ""negligence."" Zhao's case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, ""You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one."" ""Double-hit cases"" have been around for decades. I first heard of the ""hit-to-kill"" phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near miss of a motorcyclist, he said, ""If I hit someone, I'll hit him again and make sure he's dead.""",2477

He spoke about adopting a more R&B-influenced sound. He pursued an edgier aesthetic. He craved authenticity and creative control. And damn it, he wanted to sing about sex.
Well, turns out he really wasn’t kidding about that last bit. Despite the forewarning that this was going to be a “dirty and raw” debut, Zayn’s first solo single, “Pillowtalk,” eclipses all expectations for just how libidinous his music could be. The loud, sexy track has F-bombs and heavy beats galore, but Zayn's vocals stand front and center, shining on one hell of a towering chorus.
Zayn released “Pillowtalk” and its accompanying video late Thursday night, less than 24 hours after revealing the title of his upcoming album, Mind Of Mine, in an interview with Beats 1. In that same interview, the 23-year-old was curiously tight-lipped about his rumored girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, murmuring something about being “good friends.” But, uh, you can go ahead and squash any leftover doubts you may have had about their coupledom, because #Zigi is here. #Zigi is now.
In the vid, Zayn and Gigi navigate a kaleidoscopic paradise and war zone, where they make out, make up and cry black tears as Zayn sings, ""So we'll piss off the neighbors/ In the place that feels the tears/ The place to lose your fears/ Yeah, reckless behavior/ A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw/ Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day/ F--king you, and fighting on/ It's our paradise and it's our war zone.""
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture magazine earlier this week, Zayn described “Pillowtalk” as “so pure, so dirty and raw” (little did we know he was actually quoting the song at the time), adding that he’s not glazing over its explicitly sexual theme.
“I think I'm pretty black and white about what it's about,” he said. “Everybody has sex, and it’s something people wanna hear about. It’s part of everybody’s life, a very big part of life! And you don’t wanna sweep it under the carpet. It has to be talked about.”
Though “Pillowtalk” is the first full single we’ve heard from Zayn, a snippet of a new song called “Befour” was previously featured in a video accompanying his Fader magazine profile. Both tracks are expected to appear on Mind Of Mine, which is due to arrive March 25 (exactly one year after leaving 1D).",2468

“In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways,” Target announced April 19. “Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.”
Target common stock dropped from opening price of $83.50 per share April 19 to a closing price of $79.99 per share May 3—a 4.2 percent decline over the past two weeks. Its closing price of $83.98 on April 19 was the highest since July 2015.
“Target’s policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims,” the American Family Association, a nonprofit that supports Christians values, wrote April 20. “And with Target publicly boasting that men can enter women’s bathrooms, where do you think predators are going to go?”
The group continued in an updated website message:
Clearly, Target’s dangerous new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters. Over 1 million people agree with us and pledged to boycott Target stores until protecting women and children is a priority.
More than 1.15 million consumers have signed the American Family Association’s pledge to boycott Target, the “best response” the organization says it has had to a campaign in a short amount of time.
“Target stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,” Sandy Rios, the group’s director of government affairs, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon.
The American Family Association suggests that Target keep restrooms for males and females separate, but also have a single occupancy, unisex restroom available.
YouGov’s BrandIndex tracked data that shows Target’s consumer perception went down after the transgender bathroom announcement.
“I don’t think it’s a statement that people aren’t in favor of equal rights for transgender people,” YouGov CEO Ted Marzilli told USA Today. “It shows people just kind of demonstrating that they’re uncomfortable, or uncertain about how comfortable they are, with mixed public restrooms.”

They are not as safe or as well run as government correctional facilities, the Justice Department concluded after an extensive review process.
Private prisons ""simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department's Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in a memo Thursday.
Effective immediately, the Justice Department will seek to reduce and ""ultimately end"" the use of privately operated prisons. Contracts with private prison operators are not being renewed or they are being scaled back dramatically.
The announcement Thursday only impacts the 195,000 inmates in federal prisons, a small portion of America's 2.2 million incarcerated adult prisoners. There's also no impact on private immigration detention facilities, since those fall under the Department of Homeland Security, not the DOJ.
Still, advocates for prison reform believe this could be the beginning of the end for private prisons. Wall Street appears to agree. The stocks of two of the largest private prison operators fell dramatically after The Washington Post reported the news.
Corrections Corporation of America (CXW) lost 40% of its value Thursday. Geo Group (GEO) also slumped about 40%.

""It's definitely a good step. It's heading in the right direction, but it isn't as extensive as the headlines make it sound,"" says Ann Schwartzman, executive director of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, the oldest prison reform advocacy group in the world.
Most inmates are housed in state prisons or local jails that aren't covered by the Justice Department's directive. There has been pressure at the state level to end contracts with for-profit private prison operators as well.
Schwartzman says it's telling that the Justice Department found that private prisons didn't even save the government much money.

Murdoch’s got plans for National Geographic.
The memo went out, and November 3rd 2015 came to the National Geographic office. This was the day in which Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox took over National Geographic. The management of National Geographic sent out an email telling its staff, all of its staff, all to report to their headquarters, and wait by their phones. This pulled back every person who was in the field, every photographer, every reporter, even those on vacation had to show up on this fateful day.
As these phones rang, one by one National Geographic let go the award-winning staff, and the venerable institution was no more.
The name now belongs to Rupert Murdoch, and he has plans for it. The CEO of National Geographic Society, Greg Knell, tried to claim back in September that there “there won’t be an [editorial] turn in a direction that is different form the National Geographic heritage.” Murdoch’s move today only served to prove Knell’s words hollow, with hundreds of talented people now served their pink slips. And with the recognition that Murdoch’s other enterprises do not reflect the standards held by National Geographic, and with Murdoch’s history of changing the editorial direction of purchased properties, today’s move indicates that we can expect a similar shift for National Geographic.
National Geographic‘s weakness has been its cable channel. While it does feature many pieces on scientific endeavors, it also has featured shows such as Doomsday Preppers and Chasing UFO’s which lacked much of the respectability of the print magazine. They have since been removed from the schedule, but the damage to the channels reputation remains, and reflects poorly upon National Geographic itself.
The National Geographic Society has long stood for science, research, and investigation. Murdoch’s companies have long stood against all three. The two positions would be in conflict, save Murdoch’s company is firmly in control. The editorial changes will therefore be severe, and erode the 127 years of publication excellence. For the men and women who brought National Geographic to worldwide prominence, the termination of employment is a tragic end both for hard-working people, and for National Geographic itself.

Mark Oberholtzer says he traded in his black, Ford F-250 pickup truck at AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway in Houston and was told the dealership would remove the decals of his company logo from the truck on their own to avoid scratching the truck’s paint.
Months later, Oberholtzer says the truck began showing up in photographs posted on extremist Twitter feeds, with the logo and phone number of his Mark-1 Plumbing company still clearly visible.
“My secretary called me and said, ‘You can’t believe this,’” Oberholtzer told ABC News. “I really at first thought it was just somebody playing with us.”
“She was getting constant calls, threats, nothing about plumbing,” the Texas City, Texas, plumber said of his secretary.
The social media photos, which also began to pop up on Yelp, show the truck in action with ISIS militants firing an anti-aircraft gun with the Mark-1 Plumbing logo and company phone number clearly visible.
Photos of the truck even made it into the final episode of “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central.
“A Texas plumber’s work truck showed up in Syria, although, pickup truck, desert, giant machine gun, that could still be Texas,” Colbert joked on the show.
Using the website Carfax.com, the truck was tracked from an auction site in Houston to Mersin, Turkey and, finally, somewhere near Aleppo in Syria and in the hands of jihadists.

Writer and satirist Steve Charnock fed the story to CartelBlog.com as ""a work of pure fiction"" before it was picked up by mainstream media outlets. A guy can dream, I guess.
Original story: ISIS has no shortage of enemies: the U.S., France, the hacker collective known as Anonymous. And now the terrorist group can add one more to their list: Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the notorious Mexican drug kingpin who tunneled out of a prison near Mexico City in July.
According to an email reportedly sent by Chapo and leaked to CartelBlog.com, an independent website documenting the activities of Mexican cartels in America's failed drug war, Chapo isn't targeting ISIS in revenge for the Paris attacks that left 130 dead in November. Instead, he's taking aim at the terrorist organization because ISIS militants destroyed a large shipment of drugs that entered the Middle East in the past few weeks.
Here's what he alledgedly wrote:

You [ISIS] are not soldiers. You are nothing but lowly pussies. Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.
My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a whore that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them.
Obviously, this story is a little suspect given the sourcing. CartelBlog.com says the email was obtained when a Mexican blogger ""leaked the message after it was sent email encrypted directly to the Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a prominent ISIS leader."" But considering that Mexican cartels are more violent and just as brutal as ISIS (and yes, that includes beheadings), would-be ISIS militants operating in Mexico should probably watch their backs.
Chapo himself is wanted by Mexican and U.S. authorities, the latter of which has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. We'll be waiting to see if the legendary drug kingpin risks his own safety to strike back at the terrorist organization the whole world hates.

https://t.co/XwseXaDDR3 https://t.co/hQjp1LE3TD",http://www.snopes.com/syria-refugee-child-surrender/,True,FACT CHECK: Hands Up or I'll Photograph,"Claim: A photograph shows a young Syrian child “surrendering” to a camera after mistaking it for a gun.
TRUE
Example: [Collected via email, November 2015]
Syrian child holding her arms up in surrender because she thought the camera was a gun? Any idea if this is true?
Origins: As fear of refugees reached fever pitch in mid-November 2015, an old photo showing a child with her arms raised began recirculating around the internet.
The above-displayed photograph first went viral when it was shared on Twitter by journalist Nadia AbuShaban on 24 March 2015. While AbuShaban correctly identified the child as Syrian, many people doubted the authenticity of the photo since key information (such as the name of the photographer and the date the photo was taken) was missing.
The BBC (with the help of an Imgur user) were able to trace the photo back to the Turkiye Newspaper. Turkish photojournalist, Osman Sağırlı explained that the above-displayed image was taken at the Atmeh refugee camp in Syria in December 2014 and shows a 4-year-old girl named Hudea who was afraid of the telephoto lens of his camera:
“I was using a telephoto lens, and she thought it was a weapon,” says Sağırlı. “İ realised she was terrified after I took it, and looked at the picture, because she bit her lips and raised her hands. Normally kids run away, hide their faces or smile when they see a camera.” He says he finds pictures of children in the camps particularly revealing. “You know there are displaced people in the camps. It makes more sense to see what they have suffered not through adults, but through children. It is the children who reflect the feelings with their innocence.”
When the photograph was published by Turkiye in January 2015 it was accompanied by passage which gave a little more insight into Hudea’s life in a refugee camp:
Her face tightens immediately. She bites her lower lip and slowly raises her hands. She stands still without a word. It isn’t easy to console the child who thinks that the camera looking at her is a gun. Her name is Hudea… She is only 4 years old. She lost her dad in the bombing of Hama. She took refuge at the Atme camp at the Turkish border with her mom and [two] siblings.

At least 72 employees at the Department of Homeland Security are listed on the U.S. terrorist watch list, according to a Democratic lawmaker.
Rep. Stephen Lynch (D., Mass.) disclosed that a congressional investigation recently found that at least 72 people working at DHS also ""were on the terrorist watch list.""
""Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector general did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security,"" Lynch told Boston Public Radio.
""The [former DHS] director had to resign because of that,"" he said.
DHS continues to fail inspections aimed at determining the efficiency of its internal safety mechanisms, as well as its efforts to protect the nation.
Lynch referred to a recent report that found the Transportation Security Administration, which is overseen by DHS, failed to stop 95 percent of those who attempted to bring restricted items past airport security.
""We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate,"" Lynch said. ""We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.""
Lynch said he has ""very low confidence"" in DHS based on its many failures over the years. For this reason, he voted in favor of recent legislation that will tighten the vetting process for any Syrian refugees applying for asylum in the United States.
""I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process,"" he said. ""That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time.""

647193820812177408,false,ALERT: Don't fall for this new Facebook scam http://t.co/Aps0Rh5wKp http://t.co/UbRnQUi6RU,http://cbsn.ws/1FjbWoE,True,"​Don't fall for this Facebook ""dislike button"" scam","Earlier this month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Q&A that the social network was getting ready to roll out a new button to let people express, in a single click, some sentiment other than ""like."" Though he made it clear that the new, more empathetic button would not say ""dislike,"" people are calling it exactly that -- and they can't wait to get it.
Enter the scammers. Picking up on people's anticipation for a ""dislike"" button, a new scam circulating on Facebook prompts users to click to ""get newly introduced facebook dislike button on your profile.""
Showing up in people's newsfeeds, the post claims the dislike button is an invite-only feature. It brings users to a page designed to look like it is branded by Facebook and instructs them to share the page, then send it to five groups to activate the button, according to hackread.com.
Sophos security researchers writing on Naked Security said that clicking on the links brought them to two different scam sites, ""neither of which had anything to do with Facebook, or a Dislike button, and both of which wanted us to sign up by giving away personal information.""
This is classic scam stuff. Facebook wouldn't make you jump through hoops to activate a new feature. Attackers and phishers often use the colors and logos of companies to make their fake sites look legitimate. Their links may lure users into sharing personal information or unwittingly downloading malware onto their machines. By requiring that people share the page, the attackers are effectively getting them to do their bidding, spreading the ill intentioned or malicious links to their network of friends.
These all constitute major red flags.
And crucially: There is no ""dislike"" button. It's not a thing, and it's not going to be, so don't fall for it.
Zuckerberg made it clear that the company is eschewing the word ""dislike"" in its quest to make a button that lets people show empathy in circumstances when ""like"" just isn't appropriate, such when a friend posts bad news.
""Not every moment is a good moment,"" he said, adding that creating an appropriate option for a pushbutton response is ""surprisingly complicated.""
Facebook said it could start testing the new button soon, and eventually roll it out to users more widely.",2273

""The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in world,"" Obama told CBS’ Norah O’Donnell in an interview.
Obama added that there were ""steps we can take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently,” he said. “We should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these rare as opposed to normal.”
The president was briefed on the shooting earlier in the day by his Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco, and is receiving regular updates as the situation develops.
In his interview, Obama told O’Donnell that the FBI was on the ground offering assistance to local officials.
“Obviously our hearts go out to the victims and the families,"" Obama said. “So my hope is, is that we are able to contain this particular shooting, and we don’t yet know what the motives of the shooters are.”
President Obama has delivered remarks 15 times following mass shootings in America, the most recent one following the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on Oct. 1.
On Tuesday this week in Paris, President Obama remarked on the recent shooting at the Planned Parenthood Center in Colorado Springs, saying, “my hope is, is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action.”
Elsewhere in Washington, D.C., House Speaker Paul Ryan offered his condolences to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting at the top of his remarks at the Capitol Christmas Tree lighting ceremony.
“We are all thinking about the current and ongoing tragedy in California today,” Ryan said, before asking for a moment of silence. “Please keep the victims and the families in your prayers right now.""

715515982584881152,unverified,Craigslist Ad: ‘Get Paid $15 an Hour to Protest at the Trump Rally’ - https://t.co/uPbXy6zD2Q https://t.co/1sY7Sf6zoA,http://www.infowars.com/craigslist-ad-get-paid-15-an-hour-to-protest-at-the-trump-rally/,True,Craigslist Ad: ‘Get Paid $15 an Hour to Protest at the Trump Rally’,"A pro-Bernie Sanders Craigslist ad invites people in Wisconsin to protest against Donald Trump for $15 dollars an hour.
Beneath an image of a Bernie Sanders T-shirt, the ad, which was posted on Tuesday morning, reads, “Paid positions for protesters at the Trump rally.”
“Shuttle buses, parking, signs, and hourly pay available. $15 an hour due to economic inequality. Meet at 3300 W. Tripp Road, Jainesville, WI 53548 for pre-protest instructions and to get your time card.”
But is the ad genuine?
One respondent on Facebook noted that the meet-up location was 10 miles from the site of Trump’s event at the Jainesville Holiday Inn.
While that’s true, it’s still only a 16 minute drive, which is presumably why transportation was offered to bus the protesters to the rally.
The sight of protesters being paid right in front of Trump supporters would also be something that organizers would obviously be keen to avoid.
Google maps shows that the meet-up spot, 3300 W. Tripp Road, is a parking lot in a remote location.
The Craigslist ad was subsequently deleted after it began to receive attention on pro-Trump forums.
Whether the ad is real or not, we know that at least some anti-Trump protesters were recruited via a Craigslist ad before the march at Trump Tower in New York City earlier this month.
Writing for the Daily Caller, former Trump advisor Roger Stone revealed, “Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craig’s list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters.”
MoveOn, which is funded by billionaire George Soros, also took credit for causing the cancellation of Trump’s rally in Chicago back on March 11 after hundreds of Bernie Sanders supporters infiltrated the event and staged violence which the media later blamed on Donald Trump.
Following the riots in Chicago, left-wing groups vowed to stage mass civil disobedience at Trump rallies across the country beginning in April.

Bannon on the AFA’s Target boycott, which now has the support of more than 1.2 million families.
Asked about what is ultimately behind efforts like the one at Target and others being advanced by the Obama administration, Rios said:
We have a push from the left to deconstruct everything that’s called normal. And that includes sexuality. It’s part of the Marxist theory to deconstruct the family and to recreate new systems. And so, I’m not saying everybody that’s doing this has read Marx and is doing Marx’s bidding, but we know that that was at least one of the beginnings of this sexual anarchy.
Added Rios:
I think it’s also interesting to note now the Justice Department is also coming down on North Carolina, threatening them that if they don’t change that law by Monday, the government’s going to withhold money, or whatever the threat exactly is, they’re going to do something.
Rios justifiably sees it as part of a much broader theme with the current administration:
And remember Robert Gates was interviewed recently on his thoughts about the military under President Obama, and he made the statement that he had not seen the President excited, or really enthused, about any policy–anything they discussed in terms of strategy, except for gays in the military. And Robert Gates said this on television, that that was the thing that was most important to the President of the United States. And I can only say that the Obama Justice Department and Education Department are now forcing schools around the country–maybe in a quiet way for some–forcing schools to adopt this policy of allowing children who think they’re boys or girls, whatever they think they are, to be able to use bathroom and bathing and changing facilities in public schools. School boards are losing this battle all over the country because they’re afraid to lose funding. So this is definitely a priority for this administration.
Almost 1.2 million signatures are currently on the petition at AFR.net.

Powell told The New York Post that Clinton had been using her personal email for State Department business for a year before he advised her to do it, as he had done during his tenure as secretary of state.
Giuliani said this is just another lie to add to ""the book of Clinton lies.""
""She lies every day!"" he said. ""What she did is outrageous, it's criminal. The only reason she only got away with it is because we have a politicized Justice Department, not a real Justice Department.""
He said the Obama administration ""disgraced"" the Justice Department by not prosecuting Clinton over her mishandling of state secrets, and he said it will be even more disgraceful if they don't look into the ""pay-to-play"" allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation.
""The Clinton Foundation is yelling out for an investigation,"" Giuliani stated. ""Money goes to the Clinton Foundation, UBS pays $1.5 million in speaking fees pays $1.5 million in speaking fees to Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton intervenes in their case, and gets the number of names they have to turn over to the IRS cut down from 55,000 to 4,900. In the old days when I was a prosecutor, we used to call that bribery.""
""The Clinton Foundation is a straight, out-and-out racketeering enterprise,"" Giuliani said. ""If the Justice Department isn't investigating that, the Justice Department is a disgrace.""

A study of both meat and vegetarian hot dogs showed that they contain unadvertised ingredients - including human DNA.
More worryingly - unless you are a hardcore vegetarian who would rather eat people than pigs - the company found human DNA in 2% of its hot dog samples, and in two-thirds of the vegetarian samples.
It's probably not human flesh you're ingesting along with your porky treat - the researchers claimed that the human DNA most likely came from hygeine issues, so saliva and other bodily fluids along the production line.
The company also found nutritional label inaccuracies, pork substitution and some unexpected ingredients, including chicken and lamb.
Clear Food used 'genomic technology' to examine foods by ingredients, analysing 345 hot dogs and sausages from 75 big U.S. brands at 10 retailers.
The report said: ""Sausages are the world's original 'mystery meat' and hot dogs have always provoked ingredient anxiety.
""In mid-19th century America, rumours circulated that some butchers made inexpensive frankfurter-style sausages with ground dog meat.
""This might explain how the hot dog got its name.""
Melinda Wilkins, a professor at Michigan State University who also specializes in food safety, spoke to CNN about the report.
She said: ""The use of genetic analysis in this type of setting is actually fascinating,
""I think we're going to see a lot more of this type of analysis happening, seeing how well food content matches food label.""
However, she would also like more information, particularly on the finding of ""human DNA.""
""When you're working with genetic material, depending on the analytic technique, you can detect a very, very small amount of DNA that's not supposed to be in there,"" she said.
""So this accusation of finding human DNA in there, you can detect a very small amount, but they're not quantifying the amount. It could be just a few cells versus a percentage content.""
This study was done in America, so UK readers can relax somewhat, although it would not be surprising if they found similar results in our sausages - remember 2013's horse meat scandal?",2215

Science via Isaac Newton. He had some excellent theories, but probably never would’ve assumed I’d use them to describe a giant corporation’s missteps. But here we are. With over one million people boycotting Target since it decided to allow men to use the women’s bathroom if they claim to identify as women, we can’t help but notice that the companies stock is going down ever since. Coincidence? Hardly.
Target’s stock has dropped and more than 1 million consumers have pledged to boycott the retail giant after it announced an “inclusive” policy allowing individuals to use the restroom or fitting room of their choice, based on their gender identity. Target common stock dropped from opening price of $83.50 per share April 19 to a closing price of $79.99 per share May 3—a 4.2 percent decline over the past two weeks. Its closing price of $83.98 on April 19 was the highest since July 2015.
Coincidence right? Nope.
What goes up must come down… Since Target said men are totes fine in the ladies room, their stock is not doing so well. It’s trending downward. Actions have consequences. Target told parents their daughter’s feelings don’t matter as much as a man who may be feeling like a woman. He doesn’t even have to look like a woman. He can just say he feels uncomfortable in the men’s room, as exposed with this hidden camera story.
Target can set any SJW policy they darn well please. That’s there prerogative. On the flip side, customers can choose to shop elsewhere if they’re not loving the co-ed bathroom love. Maybe try Walmart, where now even rude customers can lecture people for their life choices, even if they’re terrible. If you’re a business, you generally want to give people a reason to shop in your store. Not give them a reason to shop elsewhere. But Target wanted to score some points with the vocal left, who occupy a small minority. What they may now be experiencing is the reaction to that decision.
Target. It made it’s gender fluid bed, now it’s sleeping in it. With a lot fewer customers.

A new celebrity ""it couple"" has just been born. Before rumors fly over wedding dates, baby bumps and nanny cheating scandals, let's get acquainted with 2016's hottest twosome:
Leonardo DiCaprio and his vape pen.
At the Screen Actors Guild Awards Saturday night, Hollywood's who's who gathered to celebrate this year's finest performances, but all eyes were on DiCaprio (per usual) when he whipped out this sterling beauty.
Christopher Polk/Getty Images Same, Kate, same.
Seated at a table with his ""Revenant"" director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu and ""Titanic"" soulmate Kate Winslet, Leo was unafraid to get up close and intimate with his new piece throughout the ceremony. This picture is glorious for so many reasons: not only does it give us a glimpse into Leo's relationship with his vape, but we also get to see Kate Winslet eating like a normal person. The actress is really stealing the show here.
TFW your friend passes you the vape pen and you can't stop eating french fries...
Christopher Polk/Getty Images Same, Kate, same.
Considering DiCaprio was finally honored with the SAG award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor -- he's been nominated nine times -- we fully support Leo blowing off a little steam to celebrate. Social stigma be damned!
Ugh, we can't get over how cute these two are! Aren't they so adorable in this photo?
Jordan Strauss/Associated Press Leonardo DiCaprio arrives at the 22nd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on Saturday, Jan. 30, 2016, in Los Angeles.
This is only one chapter in the Leonardo DiCaprio Vape Chronicles (copyright pending). Miley Cyrus famously revealed that the actor refused to pass the pen during the 40th anniversary of ""Saturday Night Live"" back in October.
""I was sitting there and I was like, 20 feet, 15 feet from Leonardo DiCaprio sitting there with his mom and he was hitting a vape pin,"" Cyrus told Jimmy Fallon. ""There's like an etiquettecy of when you're there, you need to pass that s**t, Leo. And he never did. So that was weird to me. He wasn’t passing the vape.”
Hopefully, Leo was in a more giving mood last night after his big win. Vapes for everybody!

Lego will sell its first mini-figure in a wheelchair later this year, a company spokesman confirmed.
The addition follows online petitions and calls for Lego and other major toymakers to provide positive depictions of those with disabilities.
“We’ve got genuine tears of joy right now,” #ToyLikeMe organizer Rebecca Atkinson wrote. Her London-based Change.org petition calling for mini-figures with disabilities has received more than 20,000 signatures.
Photos of the new Lego figure emerged online following the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, Germany.

The wheelchair mini-figure will be included in a Lego City set that will go on sale in June, Lego spokesman Michael McNally said.
“We have previously offered buildable wheelchairs and also a LEGO DUPLO wheelchair, but this is the first wheelchair molded at LEGO minifigure scale,” he said.
In December, Atkinson wrote in the Guardian that Lego parts can be used to create wheelchairs and independent companies sell mini-figures in wheelchairs. But, she wrote: “Is this the same as the world’s largest toy brand getting behind the issue and including a guide dog user in the Lego City sets or factoring wheelchair access into an aeroplane design? It’s the power of the brand that is crucial.”

Statement by WCVI President Antonio Gonzalez:
Who Won the Nevada Latino Vote?
Latinos Reached a Record Share of Nevada Democratic Caucuses
(Los Angeles, Feb 22) After hearing about disputes between the Sanders and Clinton over the Edison Entry Poll Survey results on the Latino vote in the Feb 20 Primary Caucuses WCVI undertook a review of the publicly disclosed data.
WCVI concludes that the survey results are statistically consistent with the margin of victory of Hillary Clinton on Feb 20. The main dispute among pundits and between campaigns has been the assertion that it is statistically impossible for Hillary Clinton to narrowly lose the Latino vote (45% to 53% with Latinos representing 19% of the voters) and narrowly lose Whites (47% to 49% with Whites representing 59% of the voters) and still win the election by 5.3%.
However WCVI concludes the Clinton margin of victory is adequately explained by the large margin of victory Secretary Clinton won among African American voters (77% to 23% with AA's representing 13% of the voters).
Simply put there is no relevant statistical inconsistency between Edison's Entry Poll results for Latinos, Whites, and Blacks and the overall election results. Based on this fact WCVI concludes that there is no statistical basis to question the Latino vote breakdown between Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders.
We note that some analysts have said that Secretary Clinton's victories in heavily Latino precincts proved that she won the Latino vote. However the methodology of using heavily Latino or ""barrio"" precincts to represent Latino voting behavior has been considered ineffective and discarded for more than 30 years due to non-barrio residential patterns been common among Latino voters since the 1980's.
Lost is this controversy is the fact that the data shows a record high Latino vote share in the Democratic Caucuses with Latinos representing 19% of the vote compared to 13% in 2008.
WCVI is a non-profit, non-partisan Latino public policy and research organization founded in 1985 with offices in Los Angeles and San Antonio.

For the boy band, it all began in 2010, when the future bandmates auditioned separately on the U.K. singing competition The X Factor, later being assembled into a group by Simon Cowell. Take a look back at their audition clips and time on the show above.
Related Watch One Direction Cover Kanye West, Natalie Imbruglia Boy band makes first appearance to BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge to take on ""FourFiveSeconds"" and ""Torn""
From the beginning, the boys were instant hits with the show's female audience. All were teens at the time of their 2010 audition, ranging from 16-year-old Harry Styles to 19-year-old Louis Tomlinson.
Styles and Niall Horan came the closest to not making it through. Auditioning with Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely,"" the group's youngest member didn't win over judge Louis Walsh. Horan's cover of Ne-Yo's ""So Sick"" was rejected by Cheryl Cole, but it was Katy Perry — who was later referenced in a lyric on their song ""Up All Night"" — who broke the tie and let the band's sole Irish member through.
Zayn Malik, who quit One Direction in early 2015, and Louis Tomlinson were both let through unanimously in 2010 thanks to their takes on Mario's ""Let Me Love You"" and Plain White T's' ""Hey There Delilah,"" respectively. The biggest success story, however, was Liam Payne, who had auditioned for The X Factor two years prior, making it all the way to Cowell's Barbados home before being let go and told to return in a couple years. He shocked the judges with his growth, going big band and booming with a cover of the Fifties standard ""Cry Me a River.""
The rest of the clip shows a condensed version of the band's time on the show. Cowell referred to them as ""the most exciting pop band in the country today"" – which was long before One Direction became an international success. Even then, the group was a fan favorite with a huge online following, which helped launch One Direction far beyond the reality series after coming in third place on the show.",2151

He was 94.
Vigoda died in his sleep Tuesday morning at the New Jersey home of his daughter Carol Vigoda Fuchs, the Associated Press reported. The cause of his death was old age, according to Fuchs.
Born in New York in 1921, Vigoda spent years as a Broadway actor before being lifted from relative obscurity when he landed a major role in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 mafia classic The Godfather. In the film, he depicted Sal Tessio, a close associate of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) whose betrayal famously leads to a dramatic final confrontation with consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall).
Later in his career, his role as Detective Fish in Barney Miller and in Hollywood comedies like Joe Versus the Volcano and Look Who's Talking brought his acting and distinctive physical appearance to new audiences. He reprised his role from Barney Miller in a spin-off series for ABC called Fish, which ran for a season and a half in 1977 and 1978.
Vigoda’s wife, Beatrice Schy, died in 1992. He is survived by a daughter, three grandchildren and one great-grandson.
The actor was also the subject of frequent death hoaxes dating back to 1982, when People magazine mistakenly reported that he was dead. Vigoda responded by posing for a photo of himself sitting up in a coffin and holding a copy of the magazine.
In recent decades, mistaken reports of Vigoda's death have become a running joke, with tongue-in-cheek references on Late Night With David Letterman and in the 1997 comedy Good Burger. That same year, he was reportedly told by a salesman: ""You look like Abe Vigoda. But you can't be Abe Vigoda because he's dead.""
See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows
Reflecting this confusion, TMZ affixed the words ""Not a Hoax"" to its headline announcing Vigoda's death on Tuesday.
A website, www.abevigoda.com, was established for the sole purpose of stating whether or not the actor is still alive. Sadly, on Tuesday it was updated to reflect that he is not.",2149

Photograph by Phoo Chan, Media Drum World
In another instance of one animal riding on another, photos from California-based photographer Phoo Chan show a crow nestled on a flying eagle's back. But the crow was likely looking to do more than catch a lift.
When close enough to land, the crow was probably mid-attack, explains Kevin McGowan , a biologist who specializes in crow behavior at the Cornell lab of Ornithology.
Birds are very territorial, particularly during the summer when their hatchlings are vulnerable. Crows (and many birds) seem to have a Napoleon complex—the mere presence of a larger bird incites heckling and mobbing. McGowan says territorial birds don’t normally get too close, but this particular crow probably found itself in the eagle's draft and settled in for the ride.
View Images Not worth the eagle's attention, it ignores the crow surfing on its back.

""This would be kind of like a dog chasing a car and jumping up"" on it, says McGowan. ""Dogs always want to catch the car, but they never know what they'd do if they get it.""
But why didn't the eagle react to the crow landing? Since the crow wasn't pecking, it didn't warrant the eagle's attention.
As the largest birds of prey, eagles are harassed nonstop by birds of all species. Sometimes the hecklers are so persistent, it looks like the eagles ""are being followed by mosquitoes,"" says McGowan.

There is little doubt, then, that these photos are real. They are ""not particularly surprising,"" says McGowan.

The leader, who unveiled the world’s first gender-balanced cabinet when he took power last year, said that his wife told him that as well as encouraging his daughter to be ambitious, he should “take as much effort to talk to his sons... about how he treats women and how he is going to grow up to be a feminist just like Dad.” Trudeau, who has a daughter and two sons, added:
“We shouldn’t be afraid of the word feminist. Men and women should use it to describe themselves any time they want.”
At a session that focused on how women can get ahead in the workplace, Trudeau revealed the obstacles he had to overcome to appoint a 50/50 cabinet – with the famous justification “because it’s 2015”.
“People have to know that before I could say, ‘because it’s 2015’, an awful lot of work went in to get to that place,” he said. Because women tend to be less confident at putting themselves forward than men, Trudeau ran a campaign called “ask her to run”.
“Study after study has shown that if you ask a man if he wants to run for office his first question is ‘Do I have to wear a tie?’, but a woman will ask ‘why me’?”
Trudeau revealed that “it took an awful lot of arm twisting” to persuade Chrystia Freeland to take on the role as trade minister.
Quotas are a controversial tool for encouraging gender parity. Trudeau said that he faced criticism about not appointing a cabinet based on merit alone – but that this faded once his selection was unveiled.
Canada’s minister of democratic institutions, 30 year-old Maryam Monsef, came to the country as a refugee from Afghanistan. Trudeau said that, during a cabinet meeting on the refugee crisis, Jane Philpott, the health minister, turned to Monsef and said:
“While hearing you speak, all I could think of is right now there is a 10 year-old girl in a Syrian refugee camp who could be at this table in 20 years.”",2070
688004802245214208,non-rumor,Study: minimum wage increases haven't hurt the restaurant industry. https://t.co/UUfs1rKjQm,http://gaw.kr/kMjVy2r,True,Study: Minimum Wage Increases Don't Hurt the Restaurant Industry,"Discussions of raising our nation’s poverty-level federal minimum wage are often met with the objection that paying workers more would kill the profitability of businesses like restaurants. Not so, says a new study.
“Increasing the minimum wage will cause more unemployment” is the prototypical “Econ 101"" trope that turns out to be much less straightforward (or wrong) in real life. The new study, out of Cornell University, examines the effect of minimum wage increases on the restaurant industry specifically—an industry that is labor-heavy, employs lots of low-wage workers, and can be relied upon to lobby intensely against any sort of minimum wage increases.
Here is your bite-sized takeaway of the findings:
[The] results of this study confirm previous findings, namely, that the relatively modest mandated increases in employees’ regular and tipped minimum wages in the past twenty years have not had large or reliable effects on the number of restaurant establishments or restaurant industry employment levels, although those increases have raised restaurant industry wages overall. Even when restaurants have raised prices in response to wage increases, those price increases do not appear to have decreased demand or profitability enough to sizably or reliably decrease either the number of restaurant establishments or the number of their employees. Although minimum wage increases almost certainly necessitate changes in restaurant prices or operations, those changes do not appear to dramatically affect overall demand or industry size. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that increases in the minimum wage reduce turnover, and good reason to believe that it may increase employee productivity as well.
There may be a point at which the minimum wage could get so high that it would have diminishing returns. But the evidence tells us: we ain’t there yet. We’re a long way away, in fact. So raise it up! Whether by listening to the $15 an hour movement, or by more elegant means.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei awarded the Order of Fat’h medal to Admiral Ali Fadavi, the head of the navy of the Revolutionary Guards, and four commanders who seized the two U.S. Navy vessels, according to Reuters. Iran’s state media reported the news on Sunday.
Order of Fat'h given by Chief Commander of Armed forces to IRGC Navy commanders who captured intruding U.S. marines. pic.twitter.com/1gkGz2bh2p — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) January 31, 2016
In a tweet sent from his account Sunday, Khamenei misidentified those who were “captured” as being members of the Marines.
On Jan. 12, Iran captured the ten sailors whose boats “misnavigated” into Iranian waters, according to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Though the sailors were released the following day, Iran released video of the sailors being captured, detained and apologizing for the incursion.
Though Iran initially accused the sailors of spying, Fadavi later said an investigation had established the sailors were led astray by ""a broken navigation system"" and the trespassing was ""not hostile or for spying purposes"".
The sailors were attempting to navigate from Kuwait to Bahrain when they crossed into Iranian waters.
In one of the more enduring images from the video of the capture, the sailors are shown kneeling on the decks of the boats, with their hands on their heads, all while being watched by armed Iranian troops. Though U.S. officials initially sought to downplay the encounter, Carter recently said the images made him “very, very angry.”
The Order of Fat'h has been given to Iranian war heroes, military commanders and politicians, especially those involved in the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted between 1980 and 1988.
Khamenei has said that Iran should remain wary of the U.S., even after the two enemies reached a deal on the future of Iran's nuclear program last summer.

And also by apparently forgetting that slavery, Jim Crow laws, and the Trail of Tears (along with the rest of a not at all insignificant portion of American history) ever happened.
Haley, who spoke last night through clenched jaw, urged the country’s conservatives not to follow “the siren call of the angriest voices”—which is a very fancy way of saying Donald Trump. Trump then called her “weak on illegal immigration.”
In defending her positions to reporters this afternoon, Haley let loose a bizarre, amnesiac tale of our country’s past.
“When you’ve got immigrants who are coming here legally, we’ve never in the history of this country passed any laws or done anything based on race or religion,” Haley said to reporters in South Carolina, which removed the state capitol’s Confederate flag just this past summer at Haley’s own behest.
“Let’s not start that now,” continued the woman who presides over a state that made it illegal for “any white man to intermarry with any woman of either the Indian or negro races” until 1967.
“We’ve gone too far than to go back into a race and religion issue. I’ve been through those fights. That’s not worth it.”
South Carolina forbid any restaurant or cafeteria from serving “white and colored passengers in the same room, or at the same table, or at the same counter” until 1954.

""Quasimodo has nothing wrong with him. He's just a little different than 'normal' dogs,"" said Sara Anderson of Secondhand Hounds animal rescue in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. ""His body is compressed because of his condition [short spine syndrome], so all of his organs are crammed in his belly.""

Anderson, 31, told ABC News that she first heard about Quasi through a shelter contact in Kentucky.
""His personality is amazing,"" she said. ""He is one of the sweetest, most loving dogs, once he trusts you. He has a great 'spunk' about him.""
Anderson, who's a ""sucker for special needs dogs,"" said Quasi's temporary foster family explained the pup was named after the character Quasimodo--the protagonist from the film ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame.""
""The Quasi of Secondhand Hounds is our hero because he is the definition of the qualities we all admire in our dogs,"" the foster parent said. ""Born different, but never knowing any other way, he seeks to please the people who have shown him kind hands and warm hearts. He may not be as pretty as many dogs on the outside, but his heart and soul shine through and make him one of God’s most beautiful creatures.""
Anderson said that Quasi will be seeing a specialist today to find out more about his spinal condition that causes him to appear hunched.
Quasi now has his own Facebook page -- ""Quasi the Great"" -- with 1,100 fans and counting.
""I hope to bring awareness to animals in shelters and rescues,"" Anderson said. ""I want to bring awareness to special needs pets. Just because they're not 'normal' doesn't mean that they're not special...that they're not worth it. Special needs just mean that they're a special pet.""",1953

El Chapo, that guy whose life is so undeniably similar to the plot of the greatest AMC series you've never seen, is still running from those not keen on his most recent prison escape.
Combining these two highly tweetable figures, of course, results in some obvious fireworks. As previously reported, El Chapo and his family are not huge fans of Trump's laughably stupid statement on so-called immigration reform. Trump, for reasons entirely clear, has taken this disliking quite personally, even going so far as to reportedly enlist the service of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, such efforts apparently haven't deterred the increasingly threatening tactics of El Chapo:

Meanwhile, the entirety of American politics wishes desperately for Donald to quietly exit the 2016 race for the White House, an exit that would essentially be a gift to the nation too precious for a specific valuation.

The drastic fall in the number of carrier bags given out by Welsh shops comes just before a similar scheme is introduced in England next month.
The report, commissioned by the Labour-led Welsh government, said that 74 per cent of shoppers backed the charge and found the use of “bags for life” and other re-usable bags had resulted in a 57 per cent reduction in all bags.
The report also estimates that up to £22 million raised by the charge, introduced in 2011, has been donated to “good causes”.
As a result of these donations social benefits of up to £35 million are estimated to have been accrued through environmental, health and employment benefits.
Natural Resources Minster Carl Sargeant said that the levy, which charges a minimum of 5p for every plastic bag used, had produced a significant shift in consumer behaviour and important benefits for the environment.
Sargeant said: “I am pleased that almost four years on from the introduction of the charge in Wales’ consumer habits appear to be changing which is having a positive knock on effect on the environment as well as raising a significant amount of money for good causes.”
Wales was the first nation in the UK to introduce the Single Use Carrier Bag Charge, followed by Northern Ireland in April 2013 and Scotland in October 2014.
Carrier bag charges for large retailers are due to begin in England in October, however rules surrounding the charge have been could prove confusing for both shoppers and cashiers as it is up to till operators to decide whether the charge must be paid.
A bag must also “qualify” as plastic bag before the change can be added.
Government guidelines define a plastic carrier bag as: made of plastic, unused, including handles and 70 microns thick or less.",1916

""I think [Trump] is acting like another Hitler by inciting racism,"" wrote Schloss, an Auschwitz concentration survivor. ""During his U.S. presidential campaign he has suggested the 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,' as well as pledging to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep illegal immigrants out.""
Schloss added, ""If Donald Trump became the next president of the U.S. it would be a complete disaster.""
Schloss, who was once a Jewish refugee in Amsterdam, wrote the criticism of Trump as part of a larger opinion piece for International Holocaust Remembrance Day (Jan. 27).
This year's theme was ""Don't stand by."" Schloss noted the theme was ""particularly important now with the refugee crisis going on as more people than ever are being bystanders.""
The 86-year-old said the refugee ""situation today is worse than it was under Hitler because at that time all the Allies -- the U.S., Russia and Britain -- worked together to combat the terrible threat of Nazisim,"" but such is not the case in the fight against terrorism today.
""I am very upset that today again so many countries are closing their borders,"" she wrote. ""It is even harder for today’s Syrian refugees who have a very different culture. We were Europeans as well as Jews -- we were assimilated.""
She added, ""I remember how upset the world was when the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 and now everybody is building walls again to keep people out. It’s absurd.""
Schloss is the daughter of Erich Geirginger and Elfriede Geiringer. Her father died in Auschwitz, and her mother -- who survived -- later remarried to Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank.

Operation KKK, or #OpKKK, will also aim to shut down websites and other social media accounts affiliated with the KKK.
The on-going battle between the KKK and Anonymous began during the protests in Ferguson which erupted in the wake of a grand jury decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson for killing unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. During the protests a local chapter of the KKK – known as the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (TAKKKK) – warned protesters that ""lethal force"" would be used against them.
In response to this threat, Anonymous took control of the KKK's main Twitter account and published personal information regarding some alleged members of the TAKKKK. The amorphous group also alleged that it had evidence of a connection between the Ferguson police department and the TAKKKK.
Following the Anonymous operation, several members of the KKK reportedly left the group after having their identities exposed. Ahead of the anniversary of the Ferguson protests, a faction of Anonymous has now threatened to reveal the identities of more KKK members.

It’s sad that there are people who would spend this kind of money on this rather than spending it to do good in the world. I’m done living in fear of an oppressing force. I’m going to uphold my oath to the Constitution and sleep great at night knowing that I did everything in my power to ensure what our founding fathers did for us will not be lost.
He takes particular issue with an enormous dildo and a “bag of dicks” that appear to be made out of candy—a form of snack, so I’m not sure what his beef is here. Militia spokesperson Maureen “Mo” Peltier echoes Ritzheimer’s disgust:
People spending money to send items representing their hate. That could have been spent on good things. Or those in need. Or something. Billy Gober posted a genius idea, sell it back on ebay. So, keep sending stupid shit, it’s gonna turn a dime for them. Lol Economics!

Dylann Roof, 21, was apprehended by Shelby police on Thursday. He has been charged with nine counts of murder in a mass shooting inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, last Wednesday.
Police arrested him without incident.
Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford told the Charlotte Observer that when Roof complained he was hungry, cops went to a nearby Burger King and bought the accused mass murderer a meal while he was in custody.

""He was very quiet, very calm. He didn’t talk,” Ledford said. “He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic.”
Over the weekend, a racist manifesto purportedly written by Roof surfaced on a site that law enforcement sources told the Washington Post belonged to the 21-year-old.
""I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight,"" the manifesto said. ""I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.""

From the company Packing Sorted comes these rather clever Trolley Bags!
As you can see they fit perfectly in your trolley, meaning no wasted space and just four bags to lift out into your car. What’s more, they are all velcroed to each other at the top to stop them sliding apart until you need to remove them , but they also all roll up together for easy storage in your car boot between shopping trips.
They are easy to carry into the supermarket as demonstrated by my 4yr old son on the left who loves to help out!
Then you simply hang them on the hook at the end of your trolley as above whilst you shop. If you are scanning your own shopping you can of course put the items straight into the bags otherwise keep them rolled up until you go through the till.
The beauty of these bags are that there’s no messing around trying to open fiddly carrier bags, you simply place the bags at the end of the trolley and open them out to the end. They have velcro at the top to keep them together, which you then simply undo to lift them into the car.
These really do make shopping so simple and are the perfect solution to avoid the carrier bag charge. These are built to last, fill the whole trolley and can be used time and time again. As you can see the ones above are designed for a shallow trolley but they do also make a set for a large trolley which you can see here.
For one of my readers, I am giving away a set of Trolley Bags. All you have to do is fill out the Gleam form below.

The New York Times reported last week that Clinton told the FBI that Powell detailed to her his email practices under George W. Bush. The paper cited a passage from an upcoming book about Bill Clinton’s post-presidency that read, “Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer.”
Powell, in response, said in a statement he only sent her a memo about his email practices and had no recollection of this conversation with Clinton.
He elaborated on that statement to The New York Post, saying “The truth is she was using it (her personal email) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did.”
He added that, “her people have been trying to pin it on me.”
Powell said it didn’t bother him, according to The Post.
The conversation revelation was part of the FBI’s notes that were given to Congress last week about the agency’s questioning in July that led Director James Comey not to pursue criminal charges against her over her use of private emails.
The Times reported that the State Department has asked to review the FBI’s notes from Clinton’s questioning before they are officially released.
Asked about the Times report that Powell urged Clinton to use personal email -- and whether the bureau had cleared its release from the file -- an FBI spokesman said they did not know who the story's source was.

On Tuesday, the Woodland Town Council voted to reject a rezoning application that would allow a solar farm to be built by Strata Solar Company, the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald reported. It also put a moratorium on all solar development.
See also: Australian government finally overturns ban on wind farm investment
The council had previously ruled in favor of three other solar farms that are yet to be completed, but suspicious locals put the kibosh on the latest application.
Retired science teacher Jane Mann told the publication she was concerned the panels would prevent photosynthesis from occurring, keeping plants, which rely on the chemical process, from growing. Plants in the area around the solar panels are brown and dead due to not getting enough sunlight, Mann claimed.
No reports have yet emerged as to whether science education is also ""brown and dead"" in Woodland.
Local resident Bobby Mann, for his part, announced he was worried the panels would ""suck up all the energy from the sun,"" the paper said.
Let's have a moment of quiet sympathy for representatives of the Strata Solar Company, who had to try and counter the fears of locals with, um, facts.
Brent Niemann, for one, tried to argue the panels only use sunlight that hits them directly rather than sucking it up willy nilly. ""The panels don’t draw additional sunlight,"" he said. ""This is a tried and true technology.""
The global climate change accord completed in Paris on Saturday was the most significant indication yet the world is turning way from fossil fuels and looking to renewables. It looks like there's still some convincing to do in Woodland, however.",1770

Thanks to Yesha Callahan, who pointed it out on Twitter, NewsWatch33 is a fake site and the news about Beyoncé and Jay Z buying rights to the Confederate Flag are not true.
Beyoncé and Jay Z's lawyer confirmed earlier this week that the couple is trying to buy rights to the Confederate flag.
Last month, photos of Dylann Roof—the terrorist who shot nine black people dead in a South Carolina church—emerged, in which he's pictured posing in front of the flag. The debate on the flag's use in the South reached a new peak following the Charleston Church Massacre. Recently, the South Carolina Senate voted to take down the flag, after major retailers—Walmart, Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, among others—began to pull Confederate merch from stores.
Now, Bey and Jay want to purchase rights to the flag so it cannot be used on any merch in the future without their permission. “My clients are adamant about purchasing the rights to the Rebel Confederate flag,"" their lawyer Ralph Hammerstein told NewsWatch33. They have expressed deep concern regarding the flag and how it is tearing apart our nation. Mr. and Mrs. Carter wants to assist in the abolishment of the flag by purchasing the resell rights to the Confederate flag. If my clients are successful, purchasing the rights would mean that anyone who wants to produce merchandise using the Confederate flag would have to get permission from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. My clients have expressed that they are not looking to profit from the use of the flag, but rather prevent any further use of the flag on merchandise.”

Mr Abbott said that every Sydneysider could feel quietly proud of the way the city had handled one of the most difficult periods in its history.
“People have responded with typical Australian decency and generosity,” he said.
Mr Abbott said regardless of whether Monis had been on the watchlist of authorities, it was likely that such a crime may not have been prevented.
“It’s quite likely, certainly possible, that this incident could have taken place,” he said.
“Because the level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life, would be very, very high indeed.”

""We are working with the full co-operation of the Iraqi authorities to locate and recover the individuals,"" said a state department official.
Unconfirmed reports from Iraqi security circles said three Americans and an Iraqi translator were seized on the southern side of Baghdad.
But US officials did not say how many were held or where they were seized.
An official in Baghdad told CNN three contractors went missing on Friday.
""A company filed a report Sunday about three of its staff going missing two days ago. They are American contractors. We are looking into this report,"" the senior security official said.
""The safety and security of American citizens overseas is our highest priority,"" said US state department official John Kirby.
If it turns out to be a serious kidnapping, reports the BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad, it would be a major blow to hopes for stability and progress in Iraq.
An attack on a Baghdad shopping centre last week, claimed by so-called Islamic State militants, brought to an end a relative lull in violence that had seen no major bloodshed in the city in months.
Before US forces pulled out of Iraq in 2011, a number of Western citizens were kidnapped and killed by radical Shia groups as well as Sunni militants, but none has been abducted since then, our correspondent says.

While we were semi-hoping the water was actually going to hit other Whole Foods stores just so we could try it, the grocery chain's senior media relations specialist Liz Burkhart told The Huffington Post that the product is already off the shelves.
""We looked into the item as soon as it was brought to our attention. It was carried briefly in just one of our stores in California and was meant to be water with the essence of vegetables and/or mushrooms, which is typically made over a long period of time soaking in water. It was made incorrectly and has since been removed,"" she said.
There are a lot of things we'd rather drink than asparagus water, but this particular beverage isn't all that crazy when it comes to ""bespoke"" water.

But we still don't know exactly how it got there.
Now, rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts in the late '60s and early '70s are providing new clues about how Earth got its moon.
Many scientists have long theorized that the moon formed after a planet called Theia crashed into Earth about 4.5 billion years ago.
This photograph of the full moon was taken from the Apollo 11 spacecraft as the crew headed home in July 1969. On board was Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, and astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.
""The moon was formed by a violent, head-on collision between the early Earth and a 'planetary embryo' called Theia approximately 100 million years after the Earth formed,"" the team said in on UCLA's website.
The team reported its new research in the journal Science
The researchers analyzed seven moon rocks brought back to the Earth by the Apollo 12 15 and 17 astronauts. They compared them with six volcanic rocks from Earth, five from Hawaii and one from Arizona.
They found the oxygen in all the rocks had a similar chemical signature.
""We don't see any difference between the Earth's and the moon's oxygen isotopes; they're indistinguishable,"" said Edward Young , the study's lead author.
Young said that if Earth had only received a glancing blow, most of the moon would have been made up of Theia, and the Earth and moon rocks would not be so similar.
So what happened to Theia? Scientists say it didn't survive the collision, except for some pieces that got mixed in with the Earth and moon. If it hadn't crashed with Earth, it might have become a full-fledged planet, Young said.",1706

According to JewsNews her mission is an extension of that of Hussein Obama, to foment unrest and destabilize America.
Her message was clear, “whatever is wrong in your life is whitey’s fault, and whitey owes you.”

Washington (CNN) Bernie Sanders continues to cut into Hillary Clinton's once-commanding lead among Iowa Democrats, closing to just 7 points of the party front-runner in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, a new poll has found.
A survey released late Saturday afternoon by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics finds that Sanders, the fiery progressive senator from Vermont, trails Clinton 37% to 30%. The former secretary of state has lost one-third of her supporters since May.
Sanders' support owes more to voters' enthusiasm for his candidacy than opposition to Clinton, the poll found. A whopping 96% of his backers say they support him and his ideas, with just 2% saying their vote is motivated by a desire to stop a Clinton candidacy. As for the controversy surrounding Clinton's use of email while leading the State Department, 61% of likely Democratic caucusgoers say the issue is not important to them.
Sanders has a deeper reservoir of support, the poll found. Thirty-nine percent of likely caucusgoers say their feelings about Sanders are very favorable, with just 8% having a negative view of him. That's a sharp contrast to Clinton: 27% view her very favorably, but 19% view her negatively.
Saturday's poll marks a remarkable eight-month climb for the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist from Vermont, who is garnering support in part from his anti-establishment rhetoric.

But according to a new study, a sizeable number of vegetarians commit the ultimate dietary sin when they get drunk: they eat meat.
U.K.-based discount code website VoucherCodesPro conducted a poll with 1,789 Brits who claim to be vegetarians and found that 37 percent of all respondents admitted to eating meat after they’ve had too much to drink.
The majority of respondents (63 percent) said they stood by their personal dietary codes no matter how much they drink. But the majority of those polled who admit they've fallen of the vegetarian wagon while imbibing say it happens a lot.
When asked how often they eat meat:
--34% said every time they get drunk on a night out
--26% replied fairly often
--22% said “Rarely”
--18% said “Occasionally”
The most popular meat consumed by drunk vegetarians was kebab meat. In the U.K, Middle Eastern kebab shops are as ubiquitous as New York City pizza places and offer a wide variety of options from skewers to wraps and platters. Beef burgers were the second most popular drunk snack, followed by bacon, fried chicken, and pork sausages. Vegetarians reported that they spent an average of about $7.40 a sitting on their meaty midnight meals.
But when it came to disclosing their dirty dietary secret, a majority of meat eating vegetarian respondents (69 percent) said they never told others they ate meat.

UPD: Sorry folks, Mexican drug cartel not at war with ISIS
El Chapo (aka “Shorty”) delivered the threat to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi via an encrypted email which was later leaked by cartelblog.com.
The Mexican drug baron, who runs the notorious Sinaloa cartel, made it clear IS had “made a mistake” by destroying the cartel’s drug shipment.
""You [IS] are not soldiers,” El Chapo wrote, according to the unnamed blogger cited by cartelblog.com. “My men will destroy you…” he promised Al Baghdadi.
“Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation,” it said.
El Chapo became Mexico's top drug lord in 2003. He was believed in 2011 to have surpassed infamous “cocaine king” Pablo Escobar, with the US Drug Enforcement Administration calling El Chapo the biggest drug tycoon ever.
El Chapo is wanted by Mexico, Interpol and the US, which has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture.
Guzman was first arrested in 1993 and spent a decade in a maximum-security prison in Mexico before escaping. He spent 13 years on the run before his recapture in 2014.

Word emerged Thursday that the University of Nevada, Las Vegas may team up with casino owner Sheldon Adelson to try to bring the NFL to Las Vegas.
Earlier this month, UNLV closed a deal to expand the campus by 42 acres. The $50 million deal was approved by the board of the Nevada Systems of Higher Education in December.
On Thursday, UNLV provided to FOX5 an email from president Len Jessup that states he has been made aware that the Adelson-owned Las Vegas Sands plans to announce its support for a new special events stadium to be located on the 42 acres of land, which is situated near Tropicana Avenue and Koval Lane.
In addition, the email states that officials with the Oakland Raiders are scheduled to tour Las Vegas as part of a search for a new home. UNLV was asked to meet with Raiders officials at the 42-acre site.
A Sands spokesperson confirmed to FOX5 that plans for a $1 billion domed stadium are moving forward, with or without a team. The stadium would contain at least 60,000 seats. The spokesperson further said the deal would involve a public-private partnership and that developers may request that funds from hotel room taxes be diverted to the project.
The NFL recently rejected a bid to move the Raiders to Los Angeles. The team is currently without a lease in Oakland and is said to be considering several cities for relocation, including San Antonio.

“This woman is a political prisoner, persecuted because of her race” adds the DA, who plans to drop all charges. “I too suffer from WGP [white girl problems] and am sick of people trying to hold me accountable for my unreasonable, borderline psychotic reactions to tedious things. Her boyfriend could’ve been doing anything during those 11 minutes, like sleeping with other women. I can’t even imagine the level of anxiety she must’ve felt while sharpening that selfie-stick, waiting for him to return home. The man survived the attack but we will be filing assault charges against him and pursuing the death penalty.”

Wary Parisians vow to keep party going one week after attacks
Parisians braved the cold and rain on Friday to go for drinks and make sure the lights stayed on in the trendy, multicultural eastern parts of the capital that were hit by Islamist militants only a week ago.
Many of the 130 victims of last Friday's attacks were enjoying drinks after work on an unusually warm autumn night when Islamic State gunmen sprang from cars and sprayed them with bullets in France's worst violence since World War Two.
Tension was still high in Paris at the end of a week in which there were scores of false alarms, episodes of crowd panic and a seven-hour gunfight that left the suspected mastermind of the attacks dead.
Though some Parisians were still thinking twice about going out, some 200 figures from the country's cultural and media elite called on France to continue to have fun in defiance of militants who call Paris the ""capital of prostitution and vice"".
""One week on, let's turn on the lights and light up candles in our cafes, streets, squares and towns and make ourselves heard through the music that they hate,"" they wrote in a tribute published in the Huffington Post on Friday.
""Make noise and shine light so they understand they have lost,"" wrote the signatories, who include singer Charles Aznavour, journalist Anne Sinclair and ballet dancer Marie-Claude Pietragalla.",1681

The discount retailer pointed to many factors pinching sales, damp and cool weather in parts of the company and skittish consumers, among them.
But one thing not hitting sales is the purported boycott of Target by many customers offended by the company’s announcement last month that it would allow transgender customers and employees to use the bathroom in its stores that aligns with their identity. That came soon after a controversial law in North Carolina was passed about the use of bathrooms.
The move was met with anger in some quarters: within days, 1 million people had signed a pledge to boycott Target over the policy. But it’s not clear those shoppers actually did stop going, or whether this was just online bluster by a loud minority.
“You’ve heard us talk over the years about our commitment to diversity and inclusion,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told Fortune on a media call on Wednesday morning.
He did allow that just a few stores had some some protests and took a bit of a hit sales wise, but on the whole, the 1,800-store retailer didn’t feel anything.
“To date we have not seen a material or measurable impact on our business. just a handful of stores across the country have seen some activity and have been impacted ,” he added.
It’s not the first time Target runs afoul of a certain segment of the public: two years ago, the retailer angered customers when it asked them to take their firearms into a Target store even if local laws allow it.

She was 76.
Carne rose to overnight fame with her appearances on “Laugh-In,” where the bouncy actress’ zany persona would be doused with water every time she uttered the phrase “Sock it to me,” accidentally or not. She acted on the sketch comedy show for two years, making the occasional appearance in the third season.
Carne was also known for her tumultuous relationship with Burt Reynolds. She was the actor’s first wife, marrying him in 1963 before they divorced in 1965. She detailed their relationship, confessing to partaking in several affairs and struggling with drug addiction, in her 1985 autobiography “Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl.”
She battled heavily with drug addiction after leaving “Laugh-In,” being charged with heroin possession and prescription forgery in the late ’70s. She was acquitted of the heroin charge.
The actress was born near Northampton, Northamptonshire, England, and trained at the Bush Davies Theatrical School for Girls at East Grinstead as a child. Her first television appearance came in 1956, in “The First Day of Spring.”
Carne went on to serve as a panelist on “Juke Box Jury” and also appeared on sitcom “The Rag Trade,” as well as the 1962 comedy film “A Pair of Briefs.”
Her other TV credits include a regular role in sitcom “Fair Exchange,” “The Baileys of Balboa,” a starring role in sitcom “Love on a Rooftop” and appearances in “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”",1629

Washington (CNN) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump weighed in on the day's controversy on Monday, floating the prospect of boycotting Starbucks after the coffee giant announced it would abandon its Christmas-themed cups.
""I have one of the most successful Starbucks, in Trump Tower. Maybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don't know. Seriously, I don't care. That's the end of that lease, but who cares?"" Trump told a crowd in Springfield, Illinois, on Monday. ""If I become president, we're all going to be saying Merry Christmas again, that I can tell you. That I can tell you.""
Trump's comments, on the eve of the next Republican presidential debate, is his latest rhetoric to win over Christian evangelicals who are much of the base in states like Iowa and South Carolina. Trump is grappling with Ben Carson, the other Republican front-runner and an evangelical favorite, in those two early voting states.
Starbucks said earlier that it had removed ""symbols of the season"" used in the past, which have included reindeer and ornaments, in favor of a simple, two-toned red cup. Some Christian leaders have long attacked secular businesses for waging a ""War on Christmas"" and prevented customers and employees from sharing Christmas greetings.

Police Chief Says Dylann Roof Was Taken to Burger King Shortly After Arrest
An almost unbelievable outtake from Shelby police chief’s description of a fateful day
Late on the evening of Wednesday, June 17, a 21-year old man, Dylann Roof, sat in a prayer group with several people at Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina. An hour later, he would kill 9 of them with a handgun, because he wanted “to kill black people.” Emanuel AME is a historic, African-American icon of a church in a town with a rich Black history.
Just over 12 hours later, on Thursday morning, Roof was captured while on the run in North Carolina after authorities pulled over a Hyundai sedan which the murderous youth had apparently piloted out of town. The FBI quickly stepped in and handled Roof’s questioning after his swift arrest, but prior to that, during transport, his handling by the police was particularly peculiar. According to the account Shelby police chief Jeff Ledford gave the Charlotte Observer, Roof complained of hunger, and was treated to a meal at Burger King.
Earlier in the day, Roof had bought water and chips at a south Charlotte gas station. Now he was hungry. Police bought him food from a nearby Burger King, Ledford said.
After slaughtering 9 people in a church, Roof was arrested, strapped with a protective bulletproof vest, then treated to burgers and fries.

A top North Korean diplomat who disappeared from the country's embassy in London has defected to South Korea, officials in Seoul have confirmed.
Thae Yong-ho and his family are under the government's protection, a South Korean official said.
Mr Thae was the ambassador's deputy and is thought to be the highest-ranking North Korean official ever to defect.
His main mission in London had been to spread positive perceptions of the North Korean leadership.
He had been due to return to Pyongyang with his wife and children.
Mr Thae had come under pressure from his government to quash growing criticism of North Korea's human rights record, sources say.
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James Robbins, says it now looks as if Mr Thae's heart may not have been in the task of defending North Korea.
In the past, Mr Thae had argued the British were brainwashed by their ruling class into believing ""shocking, terrifying"" lies about North Korea under its leader Kim Jong-un.
""If the people in this country, or in America, knew that there is a country in the world where there is a free education, free housing, free medical care, then they'd have second thoughts,"" he had said in one speech.
South Korea spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said: ""On his reasons for defection, Minister Thae cited disgust with Kim Jong-Un's regime, admiration for South Korea's free, democratic system and the future of his family.""",1544

Meanwhile, people who like food and don’t have a trust fund out here like…
Eater called up Whole Foods to get an explanation for why the grocery chain would charge customers $6 for asparagus in water. Here’s how the conversation went down,
The operator denied the product existed; eventually she transferred the call to a gentleman in the produce department who did not want to give his name. He explained that the product was new, “We’ve had them on the shelf for the last few days.” When asked how the new item is made, he said, “It’s water, and we sort of cut asparagus stalks down so they’re shorter, and put them into the container.” When Eater asked what it was for, there was a long pause before he said, “Well, it’s… to drink.” He elaborated, “The nutrients from the asparagus do transfer into the water.”

More than 340,000 have signed a pledge to stop shopping at Target, in response to the corporation’s announcement this week that transgender employees and customers will be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.
“This means a man can simply say he ‘feels like a woman today’ and enter the women's restroom... even if young girls or women are already in there,” stated the American Family Association, which started the petition.
Target on Tuesday became the first giant retailer to weigh in on an issue at the center of a heated national debate.
The announcement came just after North Carolina passed a law requiring people to use bathrooms in public facilities that correspond with their gender at birth.
“#BoycottTarget has resonated with Americans,” wrote AFA president Tim Wildmon.
“Target’s harmful policy poses a danger to women and children. Predators and voyeurs would take advantage of the policy to prey on those who are vulnerable. It’s clear now that many customers agree.”

He has stood by his call for a ""total and complete shutdown"" on Muslims entering the country in face of mounting criticism , later telling a crowd: ""I. Don't. Care.""
Some American papers haven't pulled their punches, with the Philadelphia Daily News likening him to Adolf Hitler on their front page: ""The New Furor"". A spokesperson for the Council on America-Islamic Relations compared it to Nazi rhetoric from the 1930s, saying the Republican candidate ""sounds more like a leader of a lynch mob than a great nation like ours.""

So how dissimilar is Mr Trump's rhetoric to that of the Nazi dictator? We've created a quiz to see if you can tell who said what: Donald Trump or Adolf Hitler.
(For the avoidance of doubt, we are merely comparing rhetoric here. Whatever the perceived simliarities in the things they say, there remains a vital difference in what do: Hitler caused the deaths of millions; Mr Trump has no criminal record and is a democratic politician running in a free election.)

The PM asked for bug reports to boot.
Lee mentioned the program in a speech he gave at a reception on April 20 before IT industry leaders. ""The last program I wrote was a Sudoku solver in C++ several years ago, so I’m out of date,"" he said. ""My children are in IT, two of them—both graduated from MIT. One of them browsed a book and said, 'Here, read this.'"" It was a textbook on the Haskell programming language, Lee recounted. ""One day that will be my retirement reading.""
After the speech, Lee received a number of requests to see the code for his program. So today he posted a screenshot of the code along with a link to a Google Drive folder containing the source code, a sample of its output, and a compiled Windows (well, DOS command line) executable to his public Facebook page. ""The program is pretty basic: it runs at the command prompt, in a DOS window,"" he wrote. ""Type in the data line by line (e.g. 1-3-8---6), then the solver will print out the solution (or all the solutions if there are several), the number of steps the program took searching for the solution, plus some search statistics.""

ORIGIN
In mid-November 2015, many Internet users became aware that Google returned an interesting search result to those who asked the search engine if farting burned calories:
Although Google may return the results shown above to such a query, the source the search engine cited for this information, a Facebook page called “F A C T,” does not offer any evidence proving this claim. In fact, the only source provided by “F A C T” was Google itself: “Google is your friend if you think these facts are false.”
The Facebook page “F A C T,” however, didn’t pull this number out of thin air. The claim that a single fart burns approximately 67 calories has been floating around the internet since at least 2009, when an Internet troll responded to a question on ChaCha thusly:
How many calories does farting burn? The amount of calories burned by farting would depend on how long the fart lasts and how much energy you use to do it. Some people believe you can burn up to 67 calories by releasing gas.
It should be noted that similar inquiries posed via ChaCha also prompted answers of less than one calorie, not very many calories, and no calories.
So how many calories do you burn during a single fart? Unsurprisingly, we weren’t able to uncover much scientific research on the subject. But according to a post on the web site Fat Loss School, the number is much lower than 67:",1440

Roof had reportedly purchased Doritos and a beverage from a nearby gas station, but wasn't quite full — so cops covered the Burger King tab shortly after the arrest. Roof, of course, was wanted following his brutal act of domestic terrorism at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Lest you forget, Roof was a staunch white supremacist with a troubling pattern of violent language across various messageboards, including:
""I chose Charleston because it is most [sic] historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites [sic] in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.""
Roof's murder of 9 church attendees sparked two separate though chillingly intertwined debates surrounding the issues of gun control and the presence of the Confederate flag, respectively. According to reports on Monday, Senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the Confederate flag to be removed from state grounds — an admirable though embarrassingly overdue sentiment of rejecting the continued influence of the South's racist history by (hopefully) acknowledging it and moving forward.",1435

DAMMARTIN-EN-GOELE, France — An intense manhunt for the gunmen who killed 12 people at the offices of a French satirical magazine came to a bloody and dramatic end Friday, when the al Qaeda-linked brothers suspected in the terror attack were killed in a gun battle with police at a printing factory outside of Paris.
In Paris, a second siege played out at a market where a third suspect shot and killed four people before police stormed in and killed him.
In all, 17 people were killed in the terror attacks that began on Wednesday with the massacre at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, sparking the intense manhunt that paralyzed France and put the West on edge.
French authorities are still searching for a fourth suspect, believed to have aided the supermarket gunman in an attack Thursday that left one police officer dead and another wounded.
The brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police at a printing facility about 20 miles outside of Paris after a seven-hour hostage siege. Cherif told a French TV station he was ""sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda,"" and a purported member of the terror group claimed it had directed the attack on the magazine, which had mocked Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.",1422

Millions more have been forced to leave their homes for other parts of the country.
Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said the money would ""save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children"".

Eckstrom’s surgeon, Dr. Eric Barnhart, said that he was moved by his patient’s desire to see his family more, and gladly performed the procedure.
“Most dads are content to just look at their family the normal amount, but David is a special kind of father,” said Dr. Barnhart. “He loves his family so much that he was willing to undergo extremely invasive surgery to make his eyes wider and his pupils bigger, just so he could see his wife and children more. As a father myself, I aspire to be like him.”
The results were amazing, and this heroic family man said that his new eyes have been a change for the better. “My life has completely transformed since the surgery!” said Eckstrom. “Whether I’m looking at my wife when I wake up in the morning or watching my kids play, I’m seeing my family more than ever. This was definitely the right choice.”

Love was more than just an age-old crutch for pop songwriters in 1967, the year the Grace Slick–sung ""Somebody to Love"" was released; it had taken on a metaphysical dimension, and Jefferson Airplane were at the vanguard. The Summer of Love launched the band into the pop charts, but also into the eye of the psychedelic storm that was brewing in their native San Francisco. But even hippie anthems like ""White Rabbit"" couldn't keep the eerie weirdness of the times at bay.
Paul Kantner was not only a founding member, guitarist, singer and songwriter for Jefferson Airplane, he was the group's conceptual heart. Bringing along a love of literature and science fiction that seeped into the Airplane's songs along with his fuzzed-out guitar tones, Kantner remained with the band, on and off, throughout its tumultuous self-reinvention as Jefferson Starship, taking a long break in the Eighties as Mickey Thomas steered the newly christened Starship into brief pop success. Starship still tinges the legacy of Jefferson Airplane, which partly explains why the band's epochal Sixties work — as well as its uneven but sporadically brilliant output in the Seventies and beyond — finds itself curiously underrated today.

OTTAWA -- The man who is reported to have shot an assailant on Parliament Hill today is a former police officer with a background in providing security services for dignitaries, including members of the Royal Family.
Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.
He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.
The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.
He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's lieutenant-governor.
The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.
As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.
On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

Furthermore, when a participant was dunked on following a half-court alley-oop pass, we observed a sharp increase in the expression of suicidal thoughts.” The study follows similar research published earlier this year by a team from UCLA, which found an increased incidence of depressed mood and self-medication among test subjects who get absolutely lit up by a linebacker.",1350

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday that women who had abortions should face “some form of punishment” if Republicans were successful in banning the practice.
During a town hall event that set to air on MSNBC Wednesday night, host Chris Matthews insisted that Trump could not dodge the question of how to enforce an abortion ban.
“Look, people in certain parts of the Republican Party, conservative Republicans, would say, ‘Yes, it should,’” Trump replied, according to a transcript obtained by Bloomberg. “I would say it’s a very serious problem and it’s a problem we have to decide on. Are you going to send them to jail?”
“There has to be some form of punishment,” he said.
“For the woman?” Matthews pressed.
“Yeah,” Trump replied, adding that the punishment would “have to be determined.”
“They’ve set the law and frankly the judges, you’re going to have a very big election coming up for that reason because you have judges where it’s a real tipping point and with the loss of Scalia, who was a very strong conservative, this presidential election is going to be very important,” the candidate opined. “When you say what’s the law, nobody knows what the law is going to be.

Safyre Terry got what she wanted for Xmas and a whole lot more, courtesy of Katy Perry.
Safyre, who lost family members in a horrible arson fire that left her severely burned and caused her to lose a hand and a foot, had a Christmas wish -- a card from Katy Perry.
Christmas came and went and it seemed the wish was unfulfilled ... but Safyre got so many cards from well wishers it was impossible to open everything in time for the holiday.
Turns out Katy delivered in a big way. She had sent Safyre a package that the little girl opened the day after Christmas, and it was filled with great stuff, including a hoodie with ears and backpack attached, a DVD of Katy's Prismatic world tour, Katy's movie ""Part of Me,"" an iPhone 6 case that lights up and a kitty cat black purse.
There was a card attached that read, ""Safyre, I heard about your Christmas wish and am so honored that you saved the top of the tree for me! I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and a great New Year. I'll be thinking of you on Christmas day. Special girl."" Signed, Katy.

The Central Intelligence Agency posted documents of reported Unidentified Flying Objects that range in date from the late 1940s to the 1950s.

For believers in alien life, and those who want to channel your inner Mulder, one case you can choose to investigate is the case of a flying saucer in Germany in 1952.
According to CIA reports , an eyewitness told investigators that an object ""resembling a huge flying pan"" landed in a forest clearing in the Soviet zone of Germany in 1952. The eyewitness said once he was closer to the area where it landed, he saw two men dressed in shiny metallic clothing.

Countless numbers of football fans could have been killed or severely injured during the France v Germany match on Saturday – if it wasn’t for the actions of one heroic security guard.
The Wall Street Journal reports that one of the suicide bombers involved in the Paris attacks outside the Stade de France had a match ticket.
But as he tried to enter the stadium minutes after kick-off, a security guard identified only as Zouheir located an explosive device after deciding to search a man who attempted to get in near the player’s tunnel.
The bomber then backed away before deciding to detonate his device.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins apparently claimed that he was wearing a vest which contained explosives and bolts, with the idea of causing maximum damage once inside the stadium.
Thousands of supporters were in the stadium (Picture: Getty)
Shortly after this incident, a second suicide bomber detonated outside the stadium, while a third also blew himself up at a nearby McDonald’s.

If I’m elected I would be very strong in putting certain judges on the bench that maybe could change thing, but they have a long way to go,"" he said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I disagree with the court in that it should have been a states' rights issue.""

Trump has been appealing to conservative voters in Iowa during the last week and has increased his push to get voters to the caucuses on Monday night after a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll showed him leading the race by 5 percentage points.
During the interview, which was taped on Saturday night, Trump also said he was very happy with the level of evangelical support he's gotten in the state of Iowa.

Separately, the judge denied a request to depose an official in the State Department
(CNN) A federal judge denied Friday a request by a conservative legal watchdog group to depose Hillary Clinton in person over her email server but says she does have to answer written questions.
The judge, Emmet Sullivan, said Clinton will have to answer questions under oath from the group, Judicial Watch, within 30 days.
Separately, Sullivan denied Judicial Watch's request to depose an official in the State Department's Freedom of Information Act office, Clarence Finney, but approved their request to depose a former IT official, John Bentel.
Sullivan heard arguments on the deposition requests at a lengthy motion hearing in July.
At the time, he seemed skeptical that more substantive information could be gleaned from a deposition, given Clinton's numerous public statements on the subject of her email server, as well as her closed testimony to the FBI and open testimony to the House Select Committee on Benghazi.",1138

El Chapo is no fan of GOP doofus Donald Trump but he has more pressing matters. Reportedly, the Mexican drug lord, who is still on the run after escaping from prison again, has threatened ISIS.
Reports the Toronto Sun:
Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the Sinaloa cartel boss and world’s most wanted drug lord, has threatened ISIS with retaliation if it continues to destroy his drug shipments to the Middle East that go through the terror group’s “caliphate.” And he’s not mincing words. “I pity the next son of a whore who tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa cartel. I will have their hearts and tongues torn from them,” El Chapo reportedly wrote ISIS in an e-mail leaked to a Mexican blogger with ties to the cartel. The encrypted e-mail, which hasn’t been verified, was sent directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to cartelblog.com.
Apparently ISIS is against drugs—but killing innocent people is fair game.
History has shown…don’t f*ck with El Chapo.

Although the link appeared to point to a real news story, it actually directed users to the prank web site Feednewz.com where they were greeted by a “You Got Owned” meme:
Anyone can create a “prank” headline on FeedNewz.com, a site that fosters users’ spreading false but sensational claims across the Internet and then encourages those who have already been fooled to continue sharing the joke.

Sixty-three percent of vegetarians reported that they did not eat meat regardless of how much they drank.
When asked how often the rule breakers ate meat, the responses varied --- 34% said every time they drink, 26% said fairly often, 22% said rarely, and 18% said occasionally.

However, in this frame the crow did not seem to harass the bald eagle at such close proximity and neither did the bald eagle seem to mind the crow’s presence invading its personal space. What made it even more bizarre was that the crow even made a brief stop on the back of the eagle as if it was taking a free scenic ride and the eagle simply obliged.”

(CNN) Levi, a 15-year-old, three legged pitbull from Janesville, Wisconsin, is getting extra treats after helping to stop a dangerous home burglary.
Darcy Cherry told CNN affiliate WISC that when an armed robber broke into her home last week, Levi started growling and barking. The masked man had pointed a gun at Cherry and her boyfriend, Bob Stenzel. He made the couple get on the ground, then demanded money.
""Not more than a minute after that, the person fired on Levi right in the head,"" Stenzel told WISC. The bullet grazed the dog's head and lodged into its left shoulder. The intruder then ran off without stealing anything.
The dog is expected to make a full recovery from the gunshot wound. Police say the suspect is still on the loose.
