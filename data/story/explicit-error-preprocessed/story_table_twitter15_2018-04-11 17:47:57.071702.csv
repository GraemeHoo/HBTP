553470492565602305,unverified,Car chase under way in Paris as gunfight breaks out. Reports of hostages. Latest from Paris: http://t.co/2J4WQdJnTp http://t.co/Lpd4hbiXai,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11329976/Paris-Charlie-Hebdo-attack-live.html,True,Unity rally for Paris shootings: as it happened,"21.00 And that concludes our coverage of today's demonstrations in Paris , a day of solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks and a day of remembrance. In all, up to 1.6 million people gathered at the rally in Paris - 3.7 million at events across the country - making them the biggest in French history.

20.44 A fantastic photograph from our man Heathcliff O'Malley , showing what it was all about in Paris today.

20.35 Benjamin Netanyahu's message to French Jews, that they have a home waiting for them in Israel, and his government's plan to help step up immigration from France, have been criticised as insensitive. Allison Kaplan Sommer, writing on the Haaretz website, says that it is too soon after the attack on the kosher grocery store to be making such statements.

But there's a right and a wrong way to go about it, and Israel's unsubtle ham-handedness is clearly the latter. Statements like Netanyahu's sends a message that Israeli government, in a perverse ""I told you so"" manner is glad that Jews abroad are threatened because it strengthens their raison dﾒetre.

20.20 Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is speaking at the Grand Synagogue in Paris. He has thanked Lassana Bathily, the Muslim employee of a Jewish supermarket who saved several hostages on Friday, and said he appreciated the ""very firm position"" taken by French leaders against ""the new anti-Semitism and terrorism"" in France.

Our common enemy is radical, extremist Islam - not normal Islam.

20.10 And here is the line-up of world leaders, arms linked in a show of solidarity. That's Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, the president of Mali, in a central position next to Francois Hollande. And it would be wrong - at an event like this - to draw conclusions about David Cameron's peripheral placement. But you don't need to look too closely to see Benjamin Netanyahu's security detail.

19.59 A lot of anger and confusion in the US and beyond about why John Kerry or a similarly high-ranking figure is not in Paris. Barack Obama has sent Eric Holder, the attorney general, who may not be well known in Europe but is actually very close to the American president, to attend the security summit. So it's odd that - according to the US Embassy in Paris - he has not attended the march. The US is instead represented by its ambassador.

18.36 Street protests in France often end in violence, with the CRS riot police battling hard core elements that loiter after the peaceful protesters head home.

But, says Rory Mulholland, on Sunday's giant unity march in Paris, the crowd applauded and shouted ""bravo"" and ""merci"" as police trucks began to pull out of Place de la République as the demo wound down.

Earlier, as the marchers proceeded towards Place de la Nation, many said a policeman positioned on a rooftop was spotted by the crowd and treated to several minutes of applause. He finally acknowledged the tribute with a thumbs-up.

18.30 Western intelligence agencies have reportedly intercepted communications from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which indicate that the attack on Charlie Hebdo is the start of a campaign of attacks in Europe, Justin Huggler writes.

The US National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted the messages from Isil members shortly after the Paris attacks, according to a report in Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The messages also referred to Rome, the newspaper reported, but no concrete plans are known.

In the same report, Bild claimed that MI5 has warned Britain’s European partners of possible attacks on aircraft using explosives that cannot be detected by airport security.

Western intelligence agencies are concerned that the Paris gunmen may be part of a larger network, the newspaper reported, adding that the US has preliminary evidence that the brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi had contacts in the Netherlands.

In German intelligence circles, it is assumed that the Paris gunmen had contact with other militants, but there is no evidence whether the attacks were ordered by a particular organisation, Bild reported.

The NSA succeeded in breaking a code used by Isil in its communications some months ago, the newspaper said.

18.26 Morocco's foreign minister, Salaheddine Mezouar, snubbed the mammoth march against extremism through Paris on Sunday due to the presence of ""blasphemous cartoons depicting the Prophet"", the ministry said, AFP reports.

He nevertheless went to the Elysée Palace to present the country's ""sincere condolences to the French president and to the French government following the despicable attacks in France this week"".

18.07 AFP now reporting at least 3.3 million march against extremism in France. It's believed up to 1.5m marched in Paris alone, and many thousands more across the world including in Montreal where 25,000 showed their solidarity with France.

The day began with crowds gathering and Ahmed Merabet's memorial service. Mr Merabet had been the French Muslim police officer killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack. His brother thanked everyone for turning out to rallies and said ""it meant a lot to us"".

(Paris)

17.48 According to French officials, this rally is the largest demonstration in French history.

17.36 The march is coming to an end as thousands rally together at Place de la Nation

17.30 The massive turnout is, according to French TV, unlike the country has seen since the 1944 Liberation of Paris from Nazi occupation, AFP writes.

17.14 Police in Belgium have reportedly arrested a man suspected of making a bomb threat against Le Soir newspaper today, writes Harriet Alexander.

Le Soir names him as Thierry Carreyn, a 53-year-old who in 1999 blew up a phone box outside the offices of Vlaams Blok - the far Right Belgian political party, now called Vlaams Belang.

17.06 The crowd was so dense in Place de la République that it took nearly an hour for its to start moving out of the square after the official start of the march, reports Rory Mulholland from Paris.

As the hundreds of thousands of marchers proceeded at a snail's pace towards Place de la Nation, there were frequent renditions of the Marseillaise national anthem, interspersed with chants of ""Liberté, Liberté"". Many marchers carried giant pencils in a tribute to the cartoonists killed in the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine.

Countless others sported banners with the Je Suis Charlie slogan that has become the rallying cry for the millions of French who condemn what they see as an attack on freedom of speech.

People who lived along the route of the demonstration hung out of their windows to shout support.

Mohammad Al Qadi, a Palestinian from the West Bank who is training to be a chef in France, said he had come to show that he too wanted to defend free speech and democracy.

But he said he feared there might be a backlash against his fellow Muslims.

""Muslims living in France feel worried because it's dangerous for us. There were attacks on mosques after the (Charlie Hebdo) attacks,"" said Al Qadi, who was carrying a Palestinian flag. ""I hope that French people will understand that Muslims are also French before they are Muslims.""

16.56 Reporters without Borders has condemned the presence of some of the leaders at today's march.

""On what grounds are representatives of regimes that are predators of press freedom coming to Paris to pay tribute to Charlie Hebdo, a publication that has always defended the most radical concept of freedom of expression?

""Reporters Without Borders is appalled by the presence of leaders from countries where journalists and bloggers are systematically persecuted such as Egypt (which is ranked 159th out of 180 countries in RWB’s press freedom index), Russia (148th), Turkey (154th) and United Arab Emirates (118th).""

Meanwhile, David Cameron has shared his thoughts on today's march...

The #CharlieHebdo march was inspirational. Here I talk about tackling the poisonous ideology behind the murders: https://t.co/i704Kfz9kw — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) January 11, 2015

16.46 Boris Johnson said on Sky News: ""I am not interested in this civil liberties stuff. If they a threat I want their email and calls listened to.""

16.43 Luke Heighton at Trafalgar Square shares this picture of the French flag projected on to the National Gallery. Boris Johnson on BBC said the projection was to show London stood in solidarity with Paris.

""Paris has been through a particularly terrible few days and we in London went through the same thing 10 years ago.

""We remember what the city went through and how we reacted: we came together, we didn't allow the terrorists to divide and sow the seeds of mistrust.""

16.33 The turnout in Paris alone is more than was predicted. According to AFP, one organiser says an estimated 1.5m people are in the centre for the march and AFP themselves say their tally of official tolls mean more than a million people rallied against terrorism outside Paris.

In Vienna, organisers say more than 10,000 people rallied in the Austrian capital.

16.26 In Paris, a Jewish man with a white rose spoke of the brotherhood he felt with a Muslim man who gave him the flower on BBC News. It was a powerful moment - symbolising what this march is intended to represent: we are all brothers and sisters, we are all human beings, and we are with the victims' families standing together during this tragic period. We are united.

Now the BBC's Chris Morris says Muslim traders are giving free flowers.

16.22 Still just as many here, despite the gathering darkness, Luke Heighton reports. The fountains below Nelson's Column appear to be lit up red, white and blue.

16.20 There's a sombre atmosphere at Trafalgar Square, with around 2,000 people braving the cold to come out in solidarity with the victims of the massacres in Paris, Luke Heighton writes.

Everyone is very clear why they are here - to defend the right to freedom of expression, including freedom of religious expression.

Everyone feels the same outrage at this week's events, but I've yet to find on person who thinks that Islam alone is the cause.

They cite everything from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the failure of successive governments in France and the UK to integrate its immigrant communities effectively.

But there is also anger that Islamist fanatics have been allowed to dictate the terms of public discourse long before the tragic events of last week.

Many of those I've spoken to also questioned whether politicians are the right people to bridge the divide, and they had little faith in the political process to heal division.

That was particularly true of many French people, who said they feared the events at Charlie Hebdo and the kosher supermarket siege would serve to bolster support for Marine Le Pen's Front National.

Emmanuelle Bigot, 39, from Paris, came with friend Emmannuelle Recoules, 40, ""because we have to stand up for free speech, and speak out against hate"".

Both women live in London, and said it was important to let the extremists know they were not winning.

Flag-waving Frenchman Sebastian came with his wife and daughter ""to defend freedom and to fight against antisemitism"".

He said it was important people came together to say 'No', and to show that ""together we are stronger than terrorism"".

There's been no trouble, and barely any police presence. In fact it's probably one of the best behaved and best dressed protest I've ever seen.

Overall the message people seem to want to convey is peace and tolerance, but there is genuine anger at what has happened.

16.07 Family members and relatives of the seventeen victims, including journalists and policemen, take part in the solidarity march on the streets of Paris

16.02 Belgian newspaper Le Soir has evacuated its offices after a bomb threat which it received shortly after 2.30pm (1.30pm in the UK), Harriet Alexander reports.

A caller said ""It's going to explode in your office. You're not taking us seriously."" The caller said that he was acting in the name of ""the extreme Left"".

The caller said that he had had enough of the coverage of the Charlie Hebdo attacks, which ""fuels the extreme Right.""

The caller is thought to have been identified, but police in Belgium are confirming this.

Le Soir's homepage

The offices were evacutated, and the journalists are waiting to be allowed back inside.

Many of the newspapers editors were at that time at a demonstration in Brussels ""against hatred"", and have rushed back to the offices.

15.45 You may have see a pair of eyes staring at you from the crowds - they are the eyes of Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier, the Mail Online says.

15.42 Sky News' political editor, Faisal Islam, shares this powerful placard.

15.37 The funeral for a French policeman shot dead outside the offices of Charlie Hebdo has been held in Paris, hours before today's massive march in memory of the victims, writes Harriet Alexander.

Ahmed Merabet, 42, was the first officer on the scene of Wednesday's attack, carried out by al Qaeda brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. The brothers shot Mr Merabet as he approached, and then fired at him point blank as he lay on the pavement.

On Sunday morning thousands of people gathered in the suburb of Livry-Gargan to the north east of Paris, standing in front of the town hall.

Mr Merabet grew up in the suburb, attending the Andre-Boulloche lycee, as one of five children of Algerian immigrant parents. He ran a cleaning company before joining the police force eight years ago, and worked hard for a promotion.

Read the full report here.

15.30 Want to know who's at the march? AFP says these are the leaders and ministers attending (found via Guardian)

The Qatari Sheikh Mohammed Ben Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani is attending as well as Bahrain's foreign minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed Al Khalifa and prince Abdullah Bin Hamad al-Khalifa.

15.10 Some on Twitter are pointing out the hypocrisy of certain world leaders who don't have the best track record on free expression attending the Paris rally. For example, Turkey's PM Ahmet Davutoglu and ministers from Bahrain and Egypt.

Only recently Turkey was criticised for the arrests of scriptwriters and Zaman editor-in-chief, Ekrem Dumanli

14.59 Here in London, as aforementioned, there is a solidarity march in Trafalgar Square. The Telegraph's Luke Heighton is there where the square - not as crowded as France - is pretty full with people..

14.50 Lazio, who are playing against Roma, have Je Suis Charlie written on their T-shirts.

14.48 Hundreds of Israelis attended a rally at Jerusalem city hall on Sunday to express solidarity with the victims of last week's attacks, writes Robert Tait.

Many held up Je Suis Charlie placards while others displayed alternative signs in French reading ""I am a Jew of France."" A small number held up similar signs in Hebrew. The rally, organised by Jerusalem City Council, was addressed by Nir Barkat, the city's mayor, and Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar, its chief rabbi.

It came as Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister - attending a mass rally in Paris along with Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, and Naftali Bennett, the industry minister - announced that French Jews wishing to emigrate to Israel would be ""welcomed with open arms"".

Later his office announced that he had accepted the requests of the families of four French Jews killed by a jihadist during last Friday's siege of a Kosher supermarket to be buried in Israel. The funerals are expected to take place in Jerusalem on Tuesday.

Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority leader, also came to Paris.

14.42 The US attorney general has said there is no ""credible information"" al-Qaeda was behind the Paris attacks.

""At this point, we don't have any credible information that would allow us to make a determination as to which organisation was responsible,"" Eric Holder said in an interview from Paris with ABC's ""This Week.""

14.38 In an interview ahead of the march (which you can watch in the video above), Mr Cameron disclosed that he will meet security and intelligence chiefs on Monday to discuss how to respond to the terrorist attacks in France, writes Steven Swinford.

He said: ""We are here to demonstrate that we all stand for the values of democracy, freedom, freedom of expression and tolerance.

""We in Britain face a very similar threat - a threat of fanatical extremism - and we have to confront that in every way we can.

""That means maintaining strong security, investing in our security services, it means being very vigilant.

""But it also means confronting the poisonous narrative of Islamist extremism wherever we find it. Whether in universities or schools or our prisons or throughout our society, we'll only defeat this threat if we use all of the means at our disposal to confront and defeat it.""

He added: ""If we make sure we have strong security, confront the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism, we make sure we all play our part then I believe we can defeat it, because in the end the values that we stand for - of democracy, freedom of speech, of tolerance - these are not values that make us weak, they are values that make our societies, our economies, our countries, they're values that make us strong.""

14.34 Masses of people are out in force and not just in France. More than 10,000 people marched through the Belgian capital Brussels on Sunday in solidarity with the huge rally in Paris, a police source said.

Police had counted ""between 10,000 and 15,000"" about half an hour after the start of the march, the source told AFP. A huge ""Brussels is Charlie"" banner in French, Flemish and English was hanging in the city centre.

14.31 Many of the leaders are arm in arm, showing solidarity on this important day. The families of the 17 victims are also marching in memory of their lost loved ones, killed during a three-day siege.

14.29 And the leaders are moving.

14.28 The leaders are together and should soon be on the move.

14.23 Francois Hollande, Italian PM Matteo Renzi, Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy, German chancellor Angela Merkel, British PM David Cameron, Turkey's PM Ahmet Davutoglu among other world leaders are preparing to march

14.17 Loud applause from the crowd in Paris but solidarity for the nation of Voltaire is wide as Ruth Sherlock tweeted:

14.13 The EU culture ministers have released this statement defending freedom of expression and vowing to protect creativity, AFP reports.

""We, the ministers of culture of the European Union, stand in solidarity to defend the freedom of expression and vow to protect the rights of artists to create freely,"" said the statement, issued by the current Latvian presidency of the EU.

The ministers said they ""do not accept terrorists' attempts to impose their own standards. Since time immemorial, the arts have been an inspiration for reflection giving rise to new ideas and fighting against intolerance and ignorance.""

14.08 At the Republique Square, spontaneous applause appears to have broken out, according to the BBC. The march will go down the Boulevard Voltaire to the Place de la Nation and will be led by the families who lost their loved ones during the tragic events in Paris earlier this week.

Rory Mulholland says they will then be followed by the leaders with the unified French public behind them - a mix of athiests, Muslims, Jews and more, Mishal Hussain on BBC reports.

14.05 There are leaders from more than 40 countries including Israel, Italy and Spain. But they're definitely not alone as this image shows the sheer numbers. The march is called the March of Unity and for those on Twitter, the hashtag appears to be #unitymarch

14.00 There are solidarity marches across the world including in Trafalgar Square, BBC News reports

14.00 The four killed by jihadist Amedy Coulibaly in a hostage drama at a kosher supermarket in Paris will be buried in Israel on Tuesday, a community spokesman told AFP on Sunday.

""The four families decided to bury their dead in Israel. The funerals will be held on Tuesday at 10.00 am in the Mount of Olives cemetery"" in Jerusalem, the source said.

13.58 David Cameron said the extremist threat will ""be with us for many more years to come"" as he met with other world leaders and the French president to join the march.

13.56 The leaders are on the move, they left the Elysée Palace and are on their way to join the march.

Hollande & Valls are leading their group out of the Elysee, to go to the march, which starts at Place de la Republique in an hr #UnityMarch — Harriet Alexander (@h_alexander) January 11, 2015

13.54 The entire crowd is clapping and chanting, ""Charlie Charlie"", says Rory Mulholland

13.53 We've got pictures of the French president welcoming world leaders. Mr Hollande (R) welcomes United Arab Emirates foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan (L) at the Elysée Palace in the image below.

13.51 ""I've lived in Paris for 14 years and have never seen any demo on this scale before. The avenues leading to the Republique, a square bigger than Trafalgar Square, are jammed with people as far as the eye can see with people trying to get on to the square. So many that no one is moving any more,"" adds Rory Mulholland.

13.48 Philippe Odiau, caretaker of a building on the 20th arrondissement of Paris, told Rory Mulholland he was here ""because simply to show we are here to fight against barbarity.

""The French republic is still on its feet. But above all I came here above all for the memory of Franck Brinsolaro, a bodyguard at Charlie Hebdo, killed during Wednesday's attack.

""He was a friend of mine and he lived in my building - it was 48 hours before we realised it was him.""

13.45 Rory Mulholland has this short dispatch from the scene at Republique Square:

The march will be taking two different routes as it is thick with people and difficult to move. The avenues leading to the square from all directions are absolutely throng with people and some people will not be able to reach the square.

The tricolour flag and Je Suis Charlie posters can be seen everywhere - and it's just started to rain. There are occasional bursts of the national anthem but there is a quiet and subdued atmosphere.

There are people climbing the statue of Mariane, the symbol of the republic - some are even hanging off the edge.

One man, dressed a green statue of liberty costume, is using a pencil instead of the torch. Vincent Renau, a banker from Paris, told me why he came here because ""there's been a terrible attack on the freedom of expression and on the French republic"".

On the issue of whether he was afraid, he said he was a little. ""But I'm here to say yes to life. We must carry on.""

13.19 The British, German and Israeli leaders were also joined by Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, all of whom will march through the French capital in the same demonstration - a world first, AFP points out.

13.09 David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Benjamin Netanyahu have arrived at the French presidency

12.59 News is breaking that the US will host a summit next month on the extremism challenge and how to fight ""violent extremism around the world"".

The meeting is likely to take place in Washington DC, the US attorney-general, Eric Holder, said.

12.54 Crowds continue to gather and Valerie Trierweiler appears to also be in the crowds.

BBC News was reporting that there could be more than a million people today at the march which will take place in just over an hour, but some estimates suggest it will be 700,000.

There is a heavy armed presence as you can see from this image of French soldiers on patrol around the Place de Nation in Paris, another big site in the march. The map below shows the march's intended route:

12.44 BREAKING Associated Press has more information about the shooting of a jogger in a Paris suburb on the same day as the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which has been linked to the gunman who killed a policewoman and four hostages at a kosher grocery, a prosecutor said on Sunday.

In a brief statement, the prosecutor said ballistics tests on shell cases from the shooting on Wednesday in Fontenay aux Roses linked them to the automatic weapon used by Amedy Coulibaly at the kosher store stormed two days later. The prosecutor said the jogger was seriously wounded.

12.43 From that meeting between interior ministers, they said there was an ""urgent and crucial need"" to share European air passenger information and strengthen the EU's external borders

12.32 BREAKING The French prosecutor has confirmed Amedy Coulibaly is linked to the shooting of a jogger, causing the individual to sustain critical injuries.

12.28 Louisa Loveluck points out that officials have been sent to Paris from both Egypt and Turkey, both among the biggest jailers of journalists in the world.

12.26 Tim Chester, Deputy Editor of Mashable UK, has shared this Vine via Twitter showing the crowds gathered at Place de la République two hours before the march.

12.21 Spain's interior minister, Jorge Fernandez Diaz, earlier said he intended to call for changes to the Schengen treaty allowing border controls. His proposal for change was in order to limit the movements of Islamic fighters returning to Europe from the Middle East, AFP reports.

""We are going to back border controls and it is possible that as a consequence it will be necessary to modify the Schengen treaty,"" he told the daily El Pais ahead of a ministerial meeting on the subject in Paris.

12.16 A circle of pens laid in tribute to victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre has emerged in Trafalgar Square

12.10 To give you some idea of the scale of the security operation around the march in Paris today, a total of 5,500 police, gendarmes and soldiers are being deployed across the capital, Harriet Alexander writes.

Just to protect the president and 40-odd other heads of state and world leaders - among them Benjamin Netanyahu, Angela Merkel, David Cameron, King Abdullah and Queen Rania of Jordan - will be 150 police, on 56 motorbikes.

For the main march, 2,200 men and women will be deployed for protection - including 20 teams of officers to detect high-risk individuals.

Snipers will be placed on rooftops along the route.

Two thousand officers and 1,350 soldiers will protect other sites across Paris - transport hubs, tourist sites, media offices, religious schools and public buildings.

12.06 ""There is not one country who did not wish to be beside France... I would like to say, with great gratitude, from the depth of my heart, from the French government and people, to thank the ministers for their solidarity, [and] their boundless friendship,"" Mr Cazeneuve added.

""I want to tell them from the depth of my heart, I will not forget the way that they have been beside us. Thank you very much for being here.""

12.02 Strong words from Mr Hollande: ""The entire country will rise up,"" he told ministers, according to his entourage, reports AFP.

12.01 Earlier today, Mr Cazeneuve welcomed the Home Secretary, Theresa May, before the start of an international meeting aimed at fighting terrorism

11.57 ""We have shared information about these foreign fighters and these networks. We have decided to reinforce our cooperation.

""To improve the efficiency of our fight against terrorism in all its form, [we must do so]"" Mr Cazeneuve adds.

11.55 ""We are determined to struggle together against them and we have,"" Mr Cazeneuve says

11.53 Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, is with his European counterparts and speaking in Paris at the Elysée Palace.

11.39 Liam Fox is also on Sky's Murnaghan, and earlier today we published a piece by the former Defence Secretary, urging for more access to be given to security services to protect the UK and better funding for MI6, MI5 and GCHQ.

The spending priorities of any government are usually a reflection of the values of the population it serves. If that is so, then we have to question the priorities of our country. At a time when we face growing and sustained terrorist threats, we spend more on the heating allowance for the elderly in a year than we do on the combined budgets of our security services – GCHQ, MI6 and MI5.

[O]ur security services need to be given access to the data they require to help to keep us safe.

When Snowden took data to China and Russia, some 58,000 files came from GCHQ, information that had played a vital role in preventing terrorism in Britain over the past decade.

It was not freedom-fighting – we should call treason by its name and those who assisted Snowden must be held responsible for their actions.

11.28 Turks have tracked Boumeddiene's phone to a Turkish border town on Jan 8, but it has since gone quiet, writes Ben Farmer

Turkish counter-terrorism officials have told the Financial Times they believe that Hayat Boumeddiene may now have passed into Syria and could be in territory held by the Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, known as Isil or Isis.

The fugitive is believed to have arrived in Istanbul from Paris via Madrid on January 2. CCTV images from Istanbul airport appear to confirm her presence, Turkish officials say.

A signal from her phone was then traced on January 8 to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, which is next to Isil territory in Syria. The town is known to harbour Isil sympathisers and the porous border is easy to cross. Her phone signal has not been traced since.

The French authorities only passed on Boumeddiene’s name to Istanbul on January 9. Turkish officials say there is no evidence any of the other attackers passed through Turkey.

11.25 Le Monde says there are rumours the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu may go to Jewish supermarket but it must stressed, there is no confirmation from Israeli embassy in Paris.

11.18 More from Rory Mulholland about the Charles de Gaulle news mentioned earlier.

An airport spokesman told the Telegraph that there was no terror threat at Charles de Gaulle and that the heavy police presence was due to the arrival in Paris of foreign heads of state to attend the march to commemorate the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

11.10 Last night, five people detained in connection with the terror attacks were released from custody, the Paris prosecutors' spokesman said. The five were freed from custody late on Saturday

Family members of the attackers have been given preliminary charges, but Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said no one was in custody.

10.58 The New York Times reports on Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu's, comments as he was leaving Israel to head to Paris.

As he left, Mr Netanyahu invited French Jews to move to Israel and said he would attend a second rally of the French Jewish community.

I am going to Paris in order to participate in the rally, along with world leaders, for a renewed struggle against the Islamic terrorism that is threatening all of humanity, which I have been calling for years/

“I will say there that any Jew who wants to immigrate to Israel will be received here with open arms.""

10.50 Ahead of the rally this afternoon, security ministers for the EU, including Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden - and America held a meeting at France's interior ministry to work a out a joint response to the terror threat.

US Attorney General Eric Holder was also present.

10.42 Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, is on Sky News and said parliament needs to ""make sure laws looking at communications and security services are up-to-date"". It needs to be updated for ""online communication,"" he urged.

On the issue of Islam and terrorism, Mr Javid said: ""It's no good for people to say they're not Muslims - it's what they call themselves.

He later added: ""They try to take what is a good religion and warp it for their own means.""

He also said: ""Freedom of speech is vital to any democratic society. What a newspaper, TV channel does, it's up to them, nothing to do with the government.

""People can object but it's not for any government to tell any organisation what to do.""

10.32 A funeral service for Ahmed Merabet, the French Muslim police officer, killed during the Charlie Hebdo attack on Wednesday along with 11 others, has been held.

10.21 More from Martin Evans in Dammartin-en-Groele:

This is the scene in Dammartin-en-Groele where tens of thousands of people have turned out for a unity rally. It seems like the whole town are here. They are singing La Marseillaise and chanting ""Je Suis Charlie"".

10.18 It's not just in Paris where people gather to remember and honour the victims. In this photo, members of Sydney's French community gather in the heart of the city to pay tribute to the Paris jihadist attack victims holding sheets of paper with the words: ""Freedom"" and ""Je Suis Charlie"".

10.17 The terrorists behind the Charlies Hebdo attacks have offended the values of Islam ""more than the cartoons ever did"", Britain's first Muslim cabinet minister said, writes Steven Swinford.

Baroness Warsi, the former foreign minister, said that her faith has been ""hugely damaged"" by the ""brutal slaughter in Paris"", which she said has ""rightly been portrayed as an attack on free speech"".

She said that while she personally finds cartoons satirising her religion offensive and ""unsavoury"", freedom of expression is more important.

In an article for The Sun on Sunday she said: ""I cannot say I understand why a satirical magazine could drive anyone to mass murder. As a person of faith and as a Muslim, I know the values and reputation of my faith – any faith – cannot be diminished by a cartoon.

10.10 After meeting with the French president, François Hollande, Roger Cukierman, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said Jewish schools and synagogues would be protected by the French army ""if necessary"".

""He told us that all the schools, all the synagogues will be protected, if necessary, on top of the police, by the army,"" said.

Mr Hollande will also visit the Grand Synagogue of Paris after the march, Mr Cukierman said.

09.56 Paris supermarket siege witness: ’It was like the end of the world’

Trapped in his flat inside the police cordon, witness Ian Ayres watched the deadly end to the Paris supermarket siege, he tells Alastair Good.

09.49 A video has emerged online showing Paris supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly pledging allegiance to Isil, reports Henry Samuel.

The Senegalese-born Frenchman justifies his actions in footage filmed some time before this week's atrocity.

Coulibaly was shot dead by police on Friday after holding a dozen people hostage in a Kosher supermarket.

During the hostage siege, he killed four people named by the French Board of Jewish Deputies as Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen and Francois-Michel Saada.

French police have launched in an intensive search for Coulibaly's wife Hayat Boumeddiene, describing her as ""armed and dangerous"".

More to follow.

09.40 The 17 victims from the Paris terror attacks: (Top row) Charb, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut (aka Cabu), Bernard Maris and Tignous (middle row) Elsa Cayat, Frederic Boisseau, Ahmed Merabet, Franck Brinsolaro, Philippe Honore aka Honore and Mustapha Ourrad (bottom row) Yohan Cohen, Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Francois Saada, Michel Renaud and Clarissa Jean-Philippe.

09.37 More details have emerged of Philippe Braham one of the four victims killed in the Jewish supermarket, reports Ben Farmer.

The father of four worked was a computer engineer who had worked as an insurance agent close to the supermarket.

Philippe Braham was a father of four, with one child was from his first marriage and three from his second marriage to Valerie, his brother-in-law, Shai Ben David told the Israeli news site, Ynet.

The couple had suffered another family tragedy three years ago with the death of their first son.

""This was an incomprehensible tragedy for my sister. She survived only thanks to his strength,"" Mr Ben-David said.

Mr Braham was described as an observant Jew who attended the synagogue in Montrouge, a Parisian suburb. His brother is the rabbi of the synagogue in Pantin, another suburb of Paris.

Mr Braham had dreamed of moving to Israel. ""He loved Israel. He buried his parents and son here. He was an observant man who never harmed anyone. He visited Israel many times, the last time was several months ago to bury his mother,"" Mr Ben-David said.

Refael Braham, Philippe's 14-year-old son from his first marriage, was in Israel when he learned of his father's death.

""He was very close to his father and took it really hard,"" the head of the French aliyah project in the Netanya municipality told Ynet. ""He has been crying and refusing to believe he lost his father.""

Refael said: ""Dad went to the supermarket to shop for Shabbat. When I was with him (in France), we'd go shopping together quite often. If I hadn't made aliyah to Israel, I might have gone with him this time as well and gotten hurt.""

09.18 BBC reports that as a tribute to those killed in the attacks, London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and the National Gallery with be lit in blue, white and red - the colours of the French flag.

09.14 French police launched in an intensive search for Hayat Boumeddiene, the 26-year-old partner of one of the attackers, describing her as ""armed and dangerous"".

She is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, responsible for the attack on the Kosher supermarket. During the hostage siege, he killed four people named by the French Board of Jewish Deputies as Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen and Francois-Michel Saada.

A source familiar with the situation said Boumeddiene left France last week and travelled to Syria via Turkey. A senior Turkish official corroborated that account, saying she passed through Istanbul on Jan. 2.

A senior Turkish security official said Paris and Ankara were now cooperating in trying to trace her but that she had arrived in Istanbul without any warning from France.

""We think she is in Syria at the moment but we do not have any evidence about that. She is most probably not in Turkey,"" the Turkish source said

09.02 When François Hollande joins the mass ""unity march"" today in Paris, it will be only the second time since World War II that a French head of state has joined a street protest, reports Rory Mulholland.

The last time was when president François Mitterrand, a Socialist like Mr Hollande, discreetly slipped into the crowd at a rally in May 1990.

That demo was against racism and anti-Semitism.

08.58 In an unprecedented show of unity, the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority will both attend the rally to honour the victims of three days of bloodshed, AFP reports.

Along with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, the king and queen of Jordan will be present at the rally.

08.57 The US secretary of state, John Kerry, vowed that no act of terror would halt ""the march of freedom"" as he expressed solidarity with the people of France after last week's Islamist attacks, AFP reports. Mr Kerry is currently in India.

""We stand together this morning with the people of France. We stand together not just in anger and outrage but in solidarity and commitment in confronting extremists.

""No act of terror will ever stop the march of freedom.""

08.46 Israeli and French media report the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman and economy minister Naftali Bennett will attend today's rally.

08.37 Reuters reports on an arson attack on the German newspaper, Hamburger Morgenpost. The paper, like many others in the country, printed the cartoons from Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine which was subject to a deadly attack in which 12 people were killed.

A police spokesman said that an incendiary device was thrown at the newspaper building in the night and documents were burned inside. Two suspects were arrested near the crime scene because they behaved in an unusual manner, she added.

The newspaper said on its web page that there were no people inside the building when the attack happened. Whether the arson attack was connected to the Charlie Hebdo cartoons was still under investigation, the paper added.

08.34 The march doesn't begin in Place de la Republique until 3pm, but already people are milling around in the grand square at the heart of Paris, reports Harriet Alexander.

Groups of people are wandering around reading all the signs and looking at the mosaics created on the ground out of pens and candles. Some artistic souls have even stretched cling film between two lamp posts and drawn a series of tribute cartoons on the plastic.

Three women have brought along the French tricolour flag, and are wandering around waving it slowly.

08.29 France's Sunday front pages and a Je Suis Charlie poster, published in Le Parisien for those joining today's huge march for the Republic to hold aloft.

08.24 The Prime Minister, David Cameron, is on his way to Paris, Sky News reports. Angela Merkel is also due to attend.

Prime Minister David Cameron says he's on his way to #Paris ""to march with the French people"" as thousands are to gather at solidarity march — Sky News Newsdesk (@SkyNewsBreak) January 11, 2015

08.20 Today in numbers: 5,500 military police, 'dozens of snipers', all of the Paris police helicopter fleet will be in the air. €0 - price of all RER and Paris Metro journeys, all day.

08.19 Some of France's most celebrated artists and celebrities also lend their support to today's huge gathering, reports Patrick Sawer.

They include the Algerian-born singer Enrico Macias, the actress Frederique Bel and TV presenter Karine Le Marchande, who said: ""I want to act so that we don't surrender. Our freedom to think, to express ourselves and to laugh are our greatest resources and they are in danger.""

Le Journal du Dimanche reports on the broad spectrum of political and religious opinion backing the march - with all but the far-Right Front National in attendance.

Amar Lasfar, president of the Union of French Islamic Organisations, tells the paper: ""This march will demonstrate that France is one and indivisible. Muslims are like all other French citizens, independent of their religion. The terrorists want to create a divide between Muslims and the rest of our society. But we are French and Muslim.""

Former French World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, the most capped footballer in the country's history, has travelled to Paris especially to join the march.

He told Le Journal du Dimanche: ""It's vital that we support the victims and that we don't sink into fear. To defend society we need to build solidarity.""

08.10 Turnout is expected to be significant after smaller 'pre-gatherings' across France gathered unprecedented crowds, in excess of 100,000 in some cities.



Map showing rallies on Saturday, January 10, 2015

08.10 Unity in the face of terror is the overriding theme of the day for France, it's people and the French media on Sunday, writes Patrick Sawer in Paris.

Most of the French press concentrates on preparations for today's March for the Republic, which is anticipated to draw as many as a million people to the centre of Paris to express their outrage at the attacks which left so many dead.

The papers all report on the impressive dress rehearsals for today's march, with an estimated 700,000 people having already demonstrated against terrorism on Saturday in some of France's major regional centres, including Nantes, Marseille and Toulouse.

Alag Bunyamin, a 45-year-old Muslim building worker from Paris's 11th arrondissement, where the jihadist attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo took place on Wednesday, tells Le Parisien he is marching on Sunday to ""show solidarity with the France which opened its doors to him 25 years ago"".

Katia Ben Mohand, 21, a children's activities organisor from Saint Denis, said she was marching to fight ""the climate of fear and suspicion of all Muslims"" which she says has gripped France. Henriette Leclerq, 85, from Sevres, who lived through the war and the Resistance against the Nazis, and said: ""Today we have to mount a resistance against those who threaten our freedoms.""

08.06 On Saturday, the interior minister, Bernard Cazaeneuve, said the march will be unique. ""A tribute to the victims of terrorist bullets.""

Yesterday, the far-Right Front National lashed out at the government for not inviting its president Marine Le Pen to join national political leaders in the Paris march.

08.03 More information from Rory Mulholland on the rally:

David Cameron and Angela Merkel will walk side by side with French President François Hollande and more than two dozen other leaders on Sunday to show solidarity in the wake of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish grocery store that left 17 dead.

As they march, 150 plain clothes detectives will mingle with the crowd to protect them and a ""vast security perimeter"" will be enforced, with metro stations and roads around the centre of Paris closed.



The intended route of today's march

08.00 Good morning. Welcome to the Telegraph's live coverage of the aftermath of the shootings which have rocked Paris. As the French nation and the world reels from the attacks which killed 17 people and injured many, we'll be bringing updates of the latest reaction and the Unity rally in Paris today.

Up to one million people could attend the rally to remember the victims and heroes. Interior minister, Bernard Cazaeneuve, has said more than 5,500 police officers and soldiers will be present.

The French president, Francois Hollande, will of course attend and he will be joined by David Cameron, the UK Prime Minister, as well as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, as well as Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi.

The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is also expected to attend as well as Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's prime minister - and also one of the most high profile Muslim leaders to attend.",53749
693676692309700609,non-rumor,An unexpected bond has developed between damaged parrots and traumatized veterans https://t.co/0Zf0VISbOH https://t.co/qXd7FbyXbv,http://nyti.ms/1m2nof4,True,What Does a Parrot Know About PTSD?,"In the wild, caiques, diminutive dollops of luminous yellow, white and deep blue-green, fly in huge, tightly knit flocks whose collective wing feathers make a singular whirring sound above the rain-forest canopy. Cashew, however, for reasons unknown, had her wings overclipped by her former owner, who had bought her as a pet and then abandoned her. So each day now, Love helps her learn how to take to the air again.

The flight lessons are usually administered at the end of Love’s daily rounds. Each morning at dawn, she arrives at Serenity Park from her boat at the marina. For the next four to five hours, she, like the six other veterans in the work-therapy program there, brings food and water to the parrots, cleans their cages and nuzzles and coos and talks and squawks with them. Love, by far the most animated of the veterans that I met at the park, flits from enclosure to enclosure, miming each bird’s movements, mimicking their individual voices and attitudes and, as with Cashew, tries to restore what was taken from them.

She had only to say her student’s name once that day and Cashew was upright in Love’s right palm, a knowing head tilt signaling her readiness. Love set Cashew on a nearby perch and with the thumb and forefinger of both hands took hold of each wing by the tip and moved them up and down a few times as though priming a pump. She then extended an index finger, held Cashew briefly aloft and with a quick thrust upward let her fall free. Some frantic flailing quickly morphed into firmer flaps, Cashew’s wings finally gathering just enough air for her to gain the netting on the far side of her large mesh home. ‘‘You see,’’ Love said, beaming. ‘‘She can actually go a little distance.’’

Taking hold of Cashew once again, she cupped her against her cheek. ‘‘Their spirit gives me the will to get up and do it another day. They’re all victims here. Kind of like what the veterans have been through, in a way.’’ Love lowered her hands and watched Cashew roll over once more on her back, a play position known as wrestling that is peculiar to caiques. ‘‘They don’t belong in captivity,’’ Love said, rubbing Cashew’s white breast feathers. ‘‘But they have a real survivor’s mentality. These forgotten great beams of light that have been pushed aside and marginalized. I see the trauma, the mutual trauma that I suffered and that these birds have suffered, and my heart just wants to go out and nurture and feed and take care of them, and doing that helps me deal with my trauma. All without words.’’

Abandoned pet parrots are twice-traumatized beings: denied first their natural will to flock and then the company of the humans who owned them. In the wild, parrots ply the air, mostly, in the same way whales do the sea: together and intricately. Longtime pairs fly wing to wing within extended, close-knit social groupings in which individual members, scientists have recently discovered, each have unique identifiable calls, like human names. Parrots learn to speak them soon after birth, during a transitional period of vocalizing equivalent to human baby babbling known as ‘‘subsong,’’ in order to better communicate with members of their own flocks and with other flocks. This, it turns out, is the root of that vaunted gift for mimicry, which, along with their striking plumages and beguilingly fixed, wide-eyed stares, has long induced us to keep parrots — neuronally hard-wired flock animals with up to 60-to-70-year life spans and the cognitive capacities of 4-to-5-year-old children — all to ourselves in a parlor cage: a broken flight of human fancy; a keening kidnapee.

There were 34 parrots at Serenity Park when I was there last summer — representing a range of the more than 350 species in the psittaciformes order — a majority of them abandoned and now deeply traumatized former pets that had outlived either their owners or their owners’ patience. A parrot separated from its flock will flock fully and fiercely to the attentions and affections of its new human keeper. And when that individual, for whatever reason, fails to uphold his or her end of such an inherently exclusive relationship, the effects are devastating.

Up and down the aviary-lined corridor of Serenity Park are the winged wreckages of such broken bonds. On and on they go: the ceaseless pacing and rocking and screaming, the corner-cowering, self-plucking and broken-record remembrances. And yet at Serenity Park, the very behaviors that once would have further codified our parrot caricatures — ‘‘birdbrained,’’ ‘‘mindless mimicry,’’ ‘‘mere parroting’’ and so on — are recognized as classic symptoms of the same form of complex post-traumatic stress disorder afflicting the patients in the Veterans Administration Medical Center. They’re also being seized upon as a source of mutual healing for some of the most psychologically scarred members of both species.

‘‘The problem with parrots is that they’re so intensely attuned,’’ Lorin Lindner, the psychologist who founded Serenity Park, told me one afternoon as we stood watching Julius pace back and forth, speaking in Korean. ‘‘Parrots have so many social neurons. Their brain is filled with the capacity to mirror their flock. It’s so crucial for survival to be able to know what the flock is doing, to know what the danger signs are, when they have to get together, when night is falling and they are called to roost. They’re so attuned to being socially responsive that they can easily transfer that to us. They have the ability to connect, to feel this closeness with another being, another species.’’

Listening to Julius that day reminded me of a story I read not long ago in the journal Current Biology about a 22-year-old male Asian elephant named Koshik that resides at the Everland Zoo in Yongin, South Korea. Separated from the two female Asian elephants he was raised with in captivity, Koshik lived alone at Everland for seven years, a period during which he construed a way of speaking perfectly intelligible Korean words by sticking his trunk in his mouth and then using his tongue to shape his own plosive trumpetings into the language of the zoo’s workers and local visitors. Such ‘‘vocal learning,’’ the researchers who wrote the paper concluded, isn’t an attempt to directly communicate with us so much as it is a way for a highly social species like the elephant ‘‘to cement social bonds’’ with the only other species available.

It’s one of those unlikely natural outcomes of the so-called anthropocene, the first epoch to be named after us: the prolonged confinement of intelligent and social creatures, compelling them to speak the language of their keepers. And now, in yet another unlikely occurrence, parrots, among the oldest victims of human acquisitiveness and vainglory, have become some of the most empathic readers of our troubled minds. Their deep need to connect is drawing the most severely wounded and isolated PTSD sufferers out of themselves. In an extraordinary example of symbiosis, two entirely different outcasts of human aggression — war and entrapment — are somehow helping each other to find their way again.

Lindner, a 59-year-old native of Queens, N.Y., knew little about parrots when she first came to Los Angeles in 1976 to finish college and go to grad school in behavioral sciences at U.C.L.A. Then one day in 1987, a week before Christmas, she received a call from a friend who knew of her deep affection and affinity for animals. ‘‘He was looking for someone to take this female parrot he heard about named Sammy,’’ Lindner recalled. ‘‘She was living alone in a Beverly Hills mansion. The owner had put the house up for sale and decided to leave Sammy behind. The bird matched the place’s décor, and he thought the new owners might like that. He was sending his driver over once a week to feed her. When I went to get her, the feces in her cage were piled up in a pyramid that reached her perch.’’

The following year, Lindner started a private practice in Westwood and began to do pro bono work with the increasing number of homeless veterans she encountered in the community, many of them living at that time in encampments under the nearby 405 freeway while awaiting appointments at the West Los Angeles V.A. medical center. Overwhelmed by their stories, she began devoting herself full time to veterans, eventually enlisting the backing of the state to head a nonprofit homeless-veteran-rehabilitation program, known as New Directions, at a residential treatment center.

Spending more and more time at work, Lindner soon decided to take in another orphaned cockatoo named Mango as a ‘‘flock mate’’ for Sammy. Before long, she was tending to both New Directions, which was relocated in 1997 to a newly refurbished building on the grounds of the V.A. center, and a sanctuary for homeless parrots that she started that same year with a friend on a four-acre plot an hour-and-a-half drive north in Ojai. One morning, near the end of 1997, Lindner found herself leading yet another veterans’ group-therapy session that was getting nowhere.

‘‘The guys are sitting around, all stoic, arms crossed, not saying anything,’’ she recalled. ‘‘They’d been like that for a number of weeks. So for a change, I took them up to Ojai to help build some new aviaries there. All of the sudden these same tight-lipped guys are cuddling up to the parrots and talking away with them.’’

Lindner was soon repeating the same exercise with other veterans. The transformations she saw in both species were so pronounced that she promptly set about persuading the V.A. to allot her the grounds of an old outdoor basketball court just down the hill from the medical center so she could move the birds from her Ojai sanctuary and start a work-therapy program there. (Veterans are paid a stipend to work in the sanctuary; some, like Love, volunteer their time.) She began with two 25-foot-high aviaries; there are now nearly two dozen. Some hold as many as three or four birds, like Kiki, Phoebe and Dino (a.k.a. the Three Stooges), a now inseparable troika of umbrella cockatoos who spend their days cuddling and grooming one another. Others contain just one bonded pair like Mandy and Kookie, a female and male eclectus parrot couple, a species native to the Solomon Islands, or Jester and Tango, one Harlequin and one green-wing macaw, who never leave each other’s side. And then there are the quarters of the inveterate loners, birds still caught somewhere between their inherent, wild selves and their captive ones: Cashew, Bacardi or Julius, who is afraid of other parrots because, as Lindner explained, ‘‘he doesn’t think he is one.’’

As I stood talking that day with Lindner, who is warm and effusive, with long blond hair and bangs, I watched Jim Minick, a former Navy helicopter-squadron member who did three tours of duty overseas and suffered severe upper-body injuries in a fall from his chopper, get his fingernails cleaned by Bacardi, the blue-and-gold macaw. In another enclosure, Jason Martinez, a wheelchair-bound Army veteran, sat alongside Molly, an African gray, resting on her perch, the two of them just staring at each other.

Love approached. She was holding an elderly Goffin’s cockatoo named Bobbi, a bird kept most of her life by her owner in a kitchen drawer. She looked like a tiny plucked blue chicken, her only remaining plumage some straggly wing and tail feathers and a frayed skull cap of the ones she couldn’t reach with her beak to mutilate. Love held Bobbi aloft on her index finger and then went dashing down the path between the compound’s two rows of aviaries, shouting, ‘‘Fly, Bobbi, fly,’’ giving her fruitlessly flapping charge at least the semblance of flight.

‘‘You can look in their eyes,’’ Love said, returning with Bobbi, ‘‘any of these parrots’ eyes, and I myself see a soul. I see a light in there. And when they look at you, they see right into your soul. Look around. They’re all watching. They notice everything. It’s intense.’’

I turned to take in a multitiered array of stares, feeling at once beheld and uplifted by creatures a fraction of my weight. I couldn’t place it at first, the slow-swiveling sideswipe of their gazes, the way they’ll dip their heads below their own bodies and then crane smoothly upward, like a movie camera pulling focus. And then it came to me: They reminded me of those C.G.I. velociraptors in films, except that the scales have turned to feathers and the stunted forelimbs to vibrant wings. Time, all at once, lurched wildly backward and ahead, depositing me right back where I’d been, in that moment, and yet deeper and more present.

‘‘God is a parrot,’’ Love said. ‘‘I know that now. God supposedly interprets and mimics what we do on earth, right? Is a reflection of us? So I believe God, if she exists, must be a parrot.’’

Animal-assisted therapy is hardly a novel prescription, having been employed at least since the 18th century, when the York Retreat for the mentally ill opened in England in 1796 and began allowing patients to roam the outside grounds among farm animals. At his office in Vienna, Sigmund Freud regularly had his chow Jofi on hand during psychoanalysis sessions to reassure and relax his patients, allowing them to open up more readily. The U.S. military used dogs as early as 1919 as a therapeutic aid in the treatment of psychiatric patients at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington. Still, what distinguishes the mutually assuaging bond that the veterans and parrots are forming at Serenity Park is the intelligence — at once different from ours and yet recognizable — of the nonhuman part of the equation.

There is abundant evidence now that parrots possess cognitive capacities and sensibilities remarkably similar to our own. Alex, the now-deceased African gray parrot studied for years by his longtime companion, Dr. Irene Pepperberg, a psychology professor, is regularly held up as the paragon of parrot intelligence. His cognitive skills tested as high as those of a 5-year-old child. He mastered more than 100 words, grasped abstract concepts like absence and presence (Alex excelled at the shell game) and often gave orders to and toyed with the language of researchers who studied him, purposely giving them the wrong answers to their questions to alleviate his own boredom. Alex was also given to demonstrating what we would characterize in ourselves as ‘‘hurt feelings.’’ When Pepperberg returned to Alex one morning after a three-week absence, he turned his back on her in his cage and commanded, ‘‘Come here!’’

Stories like these are, in fact, legion among those who keep and work with parrots. Dr. Patricia Anderson, an anthropologist at Western Illinois University, told me that her expertise in anthrozoology, the study of human-animal relations, is daily tested by her own cadre of adopted, orphaned parrots, including the first bird she decided to take in nearly 30 years ago, a Quaker, or monk, parrot named Otis.

‘‘He was so bright,’’ Anderson told me. ‘‘I taught him to say ‘thank you.’ Very anthropocentric of me, I know, but he generalized it appropriately to anything I ever did for him. He never said it randomly. He only said it when I did something for him, so it appeared to have meaning to him. There appeared to be some cognition going on, and this totally blew my mind.’’ Anderson read extensively about parrots and learned that anytime she left, she should say, ‘‘I’ll be right back.’’ ‘‘I started saying that, and then whenever I began to put my shoes on in the morning to get ready to go to work, he’d say: ‘Right back? Right back?’ ’’

Though the avian cerebrum possesses only the tiniest nub of the structures associated with mammalian intelligence, recent studies of crows and parrots have revealed that birds think and learn using an entirely different part of their brains, a kind of avian neocortex known as the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale. In both parrots and crows, in fact, the ratio of brain to body size is similar to that of the higher primates, an encephalization quotient that yields in both species not only the usual indications of cognitive sophistication like problem-solving and tool use but also two aspects of intelligence long thought to be exclusively human: episodic memory and theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental states, like intention, desire and awareness, to yourself and to others.

Nature, in other words, in a stunning example of parallel or convergent evolution, found an entirely other and far earlier path to complex cognition: an alien intelligence that not only links directly back to minds we’ve long believed to be forever lost to us, like the dinosaurs’, but that can also be wounded, under duress, in the same ways our minds can. In one recent psychiatric study conducted at Midwest Avian Adoption and Rescue Services, a parrot sanctuary and rehabilitation facility in Minnesota, a captive-bred male umbrella cockatoo who had been ‘‘exposed to multiple caregivers who were themselves highly unstable (e.g. domestic violence, substance abuse . . . addiction)’’ was given a diagnosis of complex PTSD. ‘‘When examined through the lens of complex PTSD,’’ Dr. Gay Bradshaw, a psychologist and ecologist and an author of the study, wrote, ‘‘the symptoms of many caged parrots are almost indistinguishable from those of human P.O.W.s and concentration-camp survivors.’’ She added that severely traumatized cockatoos ‘‘commonly exhibit rapid pacing in cage, distress calls, screams, self-mutilation, aggression in response to . . . physical contact, nightmares . . . insomnia.’’

Veterans, of course, share similar psychological scarring, but whenever I asked any of them how it is that the parrots succeed in connecting where human therapists and fellow group-therapy members can’t, the answer seemed to lie precisely in the fact that parrots are alien intelligences: parallel, analogously wounded minds that know and feel pain deeply and yet at a level liberatingly beyond the prescriptive confines of human language and prejudices.

‘‘They look at you, and they don’t judge,’’ Jim Minick, the badly injured helicopter-squad member, told me. ‘‘The parrots look at you, and it’s all face value. It’s pure.’’

One afternoon at the sanctuary, I went up the hill to the V.A. hospital to talk with Leslie Martin. A clinical social worker and a director at the center’s trauma-recovery services, she often recommends parrot therapy for patients, including those who are ‘‘treatment resistant,’’ like Lilly Love. I asked Martin if the primordial nature of the parrot’s intelligence might have a particular effect on certain veterans. ‘‘Everyone knows these animals are very sensitive, like children,’’ she said. ‘‘The pure, primitive nature of their feelings, their emotions, activates your primitive brain. And then when they speak to you, it’s a real high.’’

Previous studies have shown that effective trauma therapies can help the brain construct neuronal bypasses around the scarred areas of a traumatized brain. ‘‘They’re only just starting to do research on this now, but there are phenomena that are operating in the prefrontal cortex,’’ Martin said. ‘‘There are some physiological and chemical changes happening that are real, that are measurable.’’ Lindner says she would like to one day enlist researchers to study the brain science behind the efficacy of parrot therapy and whether it is the parrots themselves that are helping the veterans or whether there are other variables at work. For now, however, she uses as her measure the nearby veterans’ garden just across from Serenity Park. For years, afflicted veterans were brought to work in the garden as a way of treating their trauma, essentially working in the same tranquil setting as the veterans at Serenity Park, the one obvious difference, of course, being the parrots. Lindner said she thinks that, using conventional measures of improvement for veterans suffering trauma — the ability to stay clean and sober; keeping up with their case-manager appointments; reuniting with family; finding gainful employment, and so on — the veterans who have been working with the parrots are doing better than those who spend time working at the garden.

‘‘There’s definitely something different going on at this place,’’ Lindner said. ‘‘We know that what’s preserved across species, all vertebrates truthfully, is the ability to feel compassion. As for birds and humans, we both have sympathetic nervous responses. We react the same way to trauma on the physiological level and in terms of the reparative nature of compassion and empathy. That’s what is doing the healing. That’s what is bringing the broken halves together. We don’t know what the actual healing factor is, but I believe that it has to do with mental mirroring. That the parrots get what the veterans are going through and, of course, the veterans get them, too, because, hey, they are all pretty much traumatized birds around here.’’

One afternoon at Serenity Park, a white pickup truck roared to a stop behind the work shed. Lindner emerged from the passenger side with a wooden box containing the ashes of her first parrot, Sammy, who died last March after living with Lindner for 27 years. Sammy was to be buried at the park later that day. The truck was driven by Serenity Park’s manager, Matt Simmons, a tautly built, square-jawed 43-year-old, who came to the sanctuary in 2006 after making little progress as a patient in traditional group therapy at the V.A. When his therapist first instructed him to visit the aviary down the hill, Simmons thought he was going to be ‘‘dealing with chickens,’’ he later told me. What he found instead was himself, through the eyes of the park’s winged trauma victims. He began devoting his days to caring for the parrots, forming attachments that gradually drew him out of his sense of isolation and mistrust and allowed him, in turn, to start connecting with people as well. He and Lindner grew increasingly close, and in 2009 they were married at the sanctuary. Sammy was flower girl. Lindner held a bridal bouquet made of fallen parrot feathers.

Simmons built his first computer in grade school. He joined the peacetime Navy right out of high school, he told me, to spite his father, who wanted him to go straight to college and then law school. He scored so high on his recruitment aptitude tests that the Navy wanted to assign him to a nuclear submarine. Simmons managed, instead, to secure what he believed would be a relatively easy tour as a yeoman — essentially an administrative and clerical position — on an aircraft carrier, until that ship made a sudden turn in early 1991.

‘‘We’re told we’re headed for Puerto Rico,’’ Simmons told me at dinner one night with Lindner. ‘‘And the next thing I know is the sun is behind the ship and the announcement comes that we’re off to the Persian Gulf. I wound up in Bahrain, in-country, on a top-secret mission, tethered to the belt of Navy SEALs. My secretary job was now to document beneath the thick smoke all the slayings and how many targets the planes had accurately hit. For months it looked like night during the day. I saw a lot of killing, and things I wish I hadn’t.’’

Upon his return from active duty, Simmons enrolled at the University of Cincinnati and studied literature and philosophy. He started his own software company while still in his junior year and starred at quarterback under Rex Ryan, now head coach of the Buffalo Bills, until being permanently sidelined by a knee injury. At first, he attributed the night terrors and cold sweats he began to experience in his last two years of school to the stress of course work and managing his new company. But he soon started drinking heavily, and by his late 20s became addicted to heroin and prescription drugs. Growing increasingly estranged from his first wife, he eventually was divorced, sold his company to LexisNexis and then hopped in his B.M.W. one day and headed for California, where he ended up spending a year in jail for assault after nearly killing a man in a bar fight.

The PTSD stemming from his time in the Navy wasn’t formally diagnosed for another two years. A friend suggested that he visit the West Los Angeles V.A. for help. Simmons told me that until then, he had no idea that what he was experiencing had to do with his military service. The regimen of new drugs that were prescribed by a psychiatrist there proved ineffective, and he grew increasingly closed off in therapy sessions that were dominated at that time by long-ignored Vietnam veterans with issues entirely different from those associated with the Gulf War. ‘‘I told my therapist this,’’ Simmons said, ‘‘and he basically said that if I didn’t go down and help out at the sanctuary, he was going to stop treating me.’’

Simmons instantly connected with the yellow-headed Amazon, Joey, who had adopted and raised from infancy two other birds at the sanctuary — a pair of female lilac-crowned Amazon parrots that had fallen from their nest — regurgitating his own food to feed them. For a male parrot to raise two females from another species is a rare display of altruism, Lindner told me, a behavior long thought to be exclusive to humans and other primates.

‘‘Joey came to Serenity Park around the same time I did,’’ Simmons told me. ‘‘That’s the first thing we had in common. I had learned that yellow-headed Amazons are not that friendly, so when Joey made an effort to befriend me, that meant even more. We were different species, but we got each other. I was shy, burned by humans, isolated, angry. Joey had what seemed to me the same attitude. So we bonded. He let me touch him. Only me.’’

Within weeks of his arrival at Serenity Park, Lindner told me, Simmons had pretty much taken over the place. He was up at 3 a.m. every day in the New Directions kitchen, preparing breakfast for all the veterans. Then he came down to the sanctuary and worked there until 6 in the evening, clearing out the compound, building new aviaries and expanding the existing ones.

When I asked Simmons to describe what happens to him when he is with a parrot, he instantly went into one of his signature high-speed soliloquies. ‘‘Here we go,’’ he said. ‘‘Write it down. There are things I have seen that will never leave me. There’s this huge sack of guilt and shame and pain that I carry with me, and I got it when I was 18 years old in Bahrain. Now, when I’m with a parrot, it’s not a total time-change thing, but I do have to act like a 12-year-old boy again. And here’s why. Because parrots are not domesticated animals. They haven’t been bred for hundreds of years to be at my feet.’’ Simmons paused for a sip of Coke, the third one of the night. ‘‘So in order to have a relationship with a parrot, that parrot has to select me. In order for that to happen, that parrot has to be comfortable. I have to come in open and quiet and calm. Much like that 12-year-old boy that met the mean dog next door and never had a problem. Much like that 12-year-old boy that went hiking and saw a mountain lion. I’m acting like the 12-year-old boy again around the parrots, and what that does is help me confront my trauma rather than carry it around. Because now I’m with a psychiatrist, and I’m talking about how this bird didn’t feel so good today and wasn’t very comfortable and was kind of hiding in the back of the cage, and the psychiatrist goes, ‘Hmm, you’re starting to talk about emotions.’ I’m talking about how the bird was feeling, but I’m also transferring my own emotions. So being with the parrots allows me to take that third-person look at my own trauma, which you can never do when you’re whacked out on Vicodin and Budweiser and living under a cement highway bridge.’’

We often think of empathy as a skill rather than the long-ago, neuronally ingrained bioevolutionary tool for survival that it actually is: the ability to inhabit the feelings of fellow beings (the word empathy derives from the Greek en, which means ‘‘in,’’ and pathos, meaning ‘‘suffering’’ or ‘‘experience’’); the ability to feel, for example, their fear over a threat; or thrill over a newly found food source; or sorrow over a loss, which has as much to do with the fabric of a community as any other. Empathy, in this sense, can be thought of as the source of all emotion, the one without which the others would have no register.

The more time I spent at Serenity Park last summer, the more I came to think in terms of the expansive anatomy of empathy. And not just the shared neuronal circuitry that has now been mapped across species, from us to the other primates to elephants and whales and, we now know, to creatures with entirely different, nonmammalian brains, like crows and parrots. I thought, as well, of the extraordinary capacity conferred by that circuitry to recognize and respond to the specific infirmities, both psychic and physical (although those are essentially one and the same) of another species.

I got a sense early on at the park of which parrots and veterans seemed most drawn to one another. The way, for example, Simmons said that the lilac-crowned Amazon, Dagwood, came to life around Jim Minick, the former Navy helicopter crewman. But I learned only later about the true depth of such bonds.

‘‘You know, Jim does a great job of hiding how wounded he was,’’ Simmons told me. ‘‘He has tattoos all over the elbow he can’t use anymore, and he won’t talk about it, but at one point he was sitting on the edge of the bed with a shotgun in his mouth and tears rolling down his face. On that same night, he drove his car into a tree, drunk out of his mind. So he comes to Serenity Park, and Jim doesn’t know the history of any of the birds, and which bird loved him at first? Dagwood, the one with a screwed-up wing and a crooked beak. There’s no way to explain it.’’

Jason Martinez, who suffered traumatic brain injuries parachuting into Afghanistan and now suffers from epileptic seizures, was immediately drawn to Molly, an African gray, the only parrot at Serenity Park, he learned only later, with epilepsy. And then there were the daily cheek-to-cheek murmurings between the bedraggled, drawer-bound Goffin’s cockatoo, Bobbi, and a blond 21-year-old ex-Marine named Josh Lozon.

‘‘Let’s talk about Josh,’’ Simmons said. ‘‘A good-looking guy with curly hair. He’s a little scary. He’s so broken, all of his wounds are still hidden. Who gets along with him best? Bobbi, mostly naked, bleeding from her remaining feathers. A bird who looks like a damn pterodactyl that went through a buzz saw.’’

Of all the veterans I encountered at the sanctuary, Lozon was by far the most skittish. The one time I was able to chat with him at length was when I found him early one morning atop an elevated wooden porch, one flight above a work shed, scrubbing the bars of an empty bird cage with a brush. My decision to head up the narrow steps that lead to it effectively trapped him up there.

He joined the Marines, he said, because he ‘‘wanted to hurt somebody.’’ He told me he received an exceptional score on his recruitment aptitude test, which landed him an office job working with computers, a post suited to his intellectual abilities but not his disposition. Sent to the V.A. for evaluation after frequent episodes of insubordination and erratic behavior, he was prescribed mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, neither of which, he sheepishly confided, he was presently taking, thanks to Serenity Park.

He was not able to put into words what exactly went on between him and the parrots. All he kept saying was, ‘‘It’s something about the cages.’’ Feeling his growing discomfort, I descended the stairs. Back on the ground, I looked up at Lozon, who was peacefully cooing and chirping back and forth with Koko, the Australian Adelaide rosella. He suddenly looked down at me. ‘‘They’re in these cages and helpless,’’ Lozon said, ‘‘and it’s not their fault.’’ He paused, and I started away. ‘‘But for me,’’ he continued, ‘‘I think it’s also that when I’m alone with them in those cages, I feel I don’t have to conform to what everyone expects of me. I’m free to be an animal again.’’

In the late afternoon on my last day at the sanctuary, I seemed to be the only one around. I passed Koko in his cage, sounding his particular strains of the park’s ongoing symphony of stranded human speech. I thought then of the numerous anecdotes people have told of wild-parrot flocks learning, via ‘‘cultural transmission,’’ to speak the human words taught to them by reintegrated former pets. In the parks of Sydney, Australia, where there are native wild-parrot flocks, people regularly overhear a ‘‘Hello, darling’’ or ‘‘What’s happening?’’ sounding from the trees above. The early German naturalist explorer Alexander von Humboldt wrote of encountering, during his travels in South America toward the close of the 18th century, a parrot that was the last living repository of the language of the extinct Atures Indian tribe.

All alone now among the sanctuary’s parrots, I got a sudden glimpse of a possible future. One long beyond us and our traumas. A world of winged dinosaurs, soaring and chatting back and forth, their different local dialects inflected here and there with the occasional broken shards of a long lost one: ‘‘Hey, sweetheart.’’ ‘‘Whoa! C’mon man!’’ ‘‘Whatever!’’

Nearing Serenity Park’s exit, I decided to turn back and step inside Cashew’s quarters for a moment. I had only to nestle close to her perch and she immediately hopped on my back. Crisscrossing my shoulders as I had watched her do with Lilly Love, she stopped at one point for what I assumed would be the parrot equivalent of a kiss. Instead, she began to clean my teeth: her beak lightly tapping against my enamel, the faint vibrations strangely soothing. Immediately afterward, she took a brief nap in my shirt’s left breast pocket — it felt as if I’d grown another heart — then re-emerged and crawled to the top of my head. She strolled about there for a time before plucking out one of her own deep blue-green feathers and then descending to gently place it on my left shoulder. I have it still.",34516

Both pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government denied shooting the aircraft down after US authorities said intelligence analysis showed it had been hit by a surface-to-air missile.

Pictures and video from the scene showed bodies strewn around the site of the crash amid the charred wreckage of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which fell to Earth near the town of Grabovo, about 50km from the Russia-Ukraine border.

The area has seen fierce fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels, who have shot down several military planes and helicopters in the past.

The passengers on the flight included 154 Dutch, 27 Australians, 38 Malaysians - including 15 crew, 11 people from Indonesia, four Germans, four Belgians, three from the Philippines and one Canadian.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said 23 US citizens were travelling on the aircraft and nationalities of the remaining passengers were still being confirmed.

A spokesman from The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was working to identify any British victims of the tragedy. “We are aware of the reports and are urgently working to establish what has happened,"" he said.

Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Friday that the Malaysia Airlines jetliner did not make any distress call, adding that its flight route had been declared safe by the global civil aviation body. He added investigators ""will leave no stone unturned"".

While the cause of the crash has not been determined, US Vice President Joe Biden cautiously suggested the crash was ""not an accident"" and that the jet had ""apparently blown out of the sky"", while a US official said that, while its origin was unclear, a surface-to-air missile was probably responsible.

""I say 'apparently' because we don't actually have all the details. I want to be sure of what I say. Apparently, shot down. Shot down, not an accident. Blown out of the sky,"" he said.

The Boeing 777-200 departed Amsterdam at 12.14am local time bound for Kuala Lumpur, 15 minutes later than scheduled, according to flight records.

It should have arrived in Malaysia at 6:10am local time, but did not enter Russian airspace when it was expected to, a Russian aviation source told Reuters.

The Eurocontrol organsiation, which co-ordinates European air traffic control, closed air routes in eastern Ukraine on Thursday evening.

The incident came one day after US President Barack Obama levied broad economic sanctions on Russia as punishment for its threatening behaviour towards Ukraine.

Amid tensions in the region, Russian President Vladmir Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash, the Kremlin said in a statement early on Friday.

Putin opened a meeting with his economic advisers by calling for a moment of silence over the crash, but added: ""This tragedy would not have happened if there were peace on this land, if the military actions had not been renewed in southeast Ukraine. And, certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.""

Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels and the Ukraine government have accused each other of carrying out the ground-to-air strike, with both issuing firm denials of any involvement in the disaster.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko responding by calling the crash a ""terrorist"" attack which posed a challenge to the whole world, his website said.

""Today's tragedy showed again that terrorism is not localised, but a world problem. And the external aggression against Ukraine is not just our problem, but a threat to European and global security,"" he said.

Shortly after the crash, rebel leader Alexander Borodai told the RIA-Novosti agency that discussions were under way with Ukrainian authorities on calling a three-day cease fire for humanitarian reasons.

He added that international organisations would be allowed into the region.

Prior to the suggestion of a truce, the Poroshenko rejected claims by Ukraine rebels that Kiev was responsible and said his country's armed forces did not shoot at any airborne targets.

“We do not exclude that this plane was shot down, and we stress that the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not take action against any airborne targets,” he said.

“We are sure that those who are guilty in this tragedy will be held responsible,"" he added.

An official statement from the Ukraine government blamed Russian air defence systems it claimed are protecting ""terrorists"" in the area.

It said: ""A large passenger aircraft Boeing 777, performing a flight between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, was shot down in the eastern part of Ukraine. According to the General Staff of Ukrainian Armed Forces, the plane was shot down by the Russian Buk missile system as the liner was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters.

""Ukraine has no long-range air defence missile systems in this area.

""The plane was shot down, because the Russian air defence systems was affording protection to Russian mercenaries and terrorists in this area.

""Ukraine will present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.

""The leader of the terrorists Igor Girkin (Strelkov) immediately commented on the catastrophe, believing that it was the Ukrainian jet that crashed: 'In Torez An-26 was shot down, its crashes are lying somewhere near the coal mine “Progress”. We have warned everyone: do not fly in our skies,'"" the statement read.

Emergencies Ministry members work at the site of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane crash in the settlement of Grabovo in the Donetsk region

Anton Gerashenko, an aide to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the Boeing airliner, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was at an altitude of 33,000ft when it was hit by a missile fired from a Buk launcher and crashed near the city of Donetsk - a stronghold of pro-Russian rebels.

But Russia’s military said that none of its military planes had been flying close to the Russia-Ukraine border on Thursday, RIA Novosti reported citing a military official.

Earlier, Aleksandr Boroday, Prime Minister of the recently established Donetsk People's Republic, denied the jet had been shot down by the rebels and called the incident a “provocation by the Ukrainian military”.

“We confirm that the plane crashed not far from Donetsk,” Boroday said. “Representatives of Donetsk People's Republic have headed to the scene.”

“Self-defence forces have no air-defence, which could target transport aircraft at that height,” he told Interfax.

In separate reports by Interfax, an unidentified pro-Russian separatists said they had found the jet's black box flight recorder.

The Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has ordered an investigation into what he has called an ""airplane catastrophe"", his spokeswoman Olga Lappo said on Thursday.

Elsewhere, world leaders issued statements expressing their shock, and calling for potential culprits to be brought to justice.

President Obama called the crash a ""terrible tragedy"", and said his government's priority was to determine whether any Americans were killed.

During a pre-planned phone conversation, Obama and Putin discussed the crash, the White House and Kremlin both confirmed.

Meanwhile, US senator John McCain warned that there will be “hell to pay” if the Russia military or Ukrainian separatists are deemed to have had any involvement in the 'incident'.

“If the Malaysian plane was shot down, this is obviously a game changer and has horrific consequences,"" he warned.

“It has the earmarks of a tragic mistake made by someone who had the capability to just shoot down an aircraft, and we know at least from the last couple of weeks that that could be Russian or separatist Russian capability.”

""But if it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly believing this was a Ukrainian war plane, I think there’s going to be hell to pay and there should be,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC, citing previous reports of separatists shooting down Ukrainian fighter planes.

His comments followed a tweet by the Malaysian Prime Minister, following his later statement, in which he said he was ""shocked"" by reports of a plane crash, and that an investigation was being launched into the incident immediately.

I am shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation. — Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) July 17, 2014

This video posted online purported to show the aftermath of the crash

As pictures emerged showing loved ones of those on board the flight gathering at both Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Sepang, and Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands Prime Minister Marke Rutte also said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the crash, NL Times reported.

""I am deeply shocked by the tragic news about the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur via Ukrainian territory,” he said.

“Very much is still unclear about the facts, the circumstances and the passengers.”

Late on Thursday, newly appointed Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for an UN-led international investigation to establish what caused the flight to crash, with a meeting of the Government's emergency committee - Cobra - expected to meet on Friday.

""I'm deeply shocked by this appalling incident and I send my heartfelt condolences to all those who may have lost family and friends. We're determined to get to the bottom of understanding what has happened here,"" he said.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement that if the plane crash was deliberate, it constituted an ""unspeakable crime"" for which the perpetrators must be swiftly brought to justice.

""It is a very, very sad time, made worse by reports that it might be a crime rather than an accident,"" Abbott said.

Shortly after the crash, Malaysia Airlines posted a tweet on its official account confirming it had ""lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam"".

""The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow.""

It said early on Friday that all of its European flights will take routes avoiding Ukraine.

Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow. — Malaysia Airlines (@MAS) July 17, 2014

Virgin Airlines, Lufthansa and British Airways have confirmed that they are diverting most of their flights away from Ukrainian airspace.

A spokesman from BA said: “The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority. Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace, with the exception of our once a day service between Heathrow and Kiev.""",34043

http://t.co/RZKxYskhg0 http://t.co/WK03huCNrk",http://ind.pn/UeesFQ,True,"Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash: 'Nine Britons, 23 Americans and 80 children' feared dead after Boeing passenger jet is 'shot down' near Ukraine-Russia border","Nine Britons, 23 US citizens and 80 children are reported to be among the 298 people killed when a Malaysia Airlines jet crashed near the eastern Ukraine border on Thursday.

Both pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government denied shooting the aircraft down after US authorities said intelligence analysis showed it had been hit by a surface-to-air missile.

Pictures and video from the scene showed bodies strewn around the site of the crash amid the charred wreckage of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which fell to Earth near the town of Grabovo, about 50km from the Russia-Ukraine border.

The area has seen fierce fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels, who have shot down several military planes and helicopters in the past.

The passengers on the flight included 154 Dutch, 27 Australians, 38 Malaysians - including 15 crew, 11 people from Indonesia, four Germans, four Belgians, three from the Philippines and one Canadian.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said 23 US citizens were travelling on the aircraft and nationalities of the remaining passengers were still being confirmed.

A spokesman from The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was working to identify any British victims of the tragedy. “We are aware of the reports and are urgently working to establish what has happened,"" he said.

Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Friday that the Malaysia Airlines jetliner did not make any distress call, adding that its flight route had been declared safe by the global civil aviation body. He added investigators ""will leave no stone unturned"".

While the cause of the crash has not been determined, US Vice President Joe Biden cautiously suggested the crash was ""not an accident"" and that the jet had ""apparently blown out of the sky"", while a US official said that, while its origin was unclear, a surface-to-air missile was probably responsible.

""I say 'apparently' because we don't actually have all the details. I want to be sure of what I say. Apparently, shot down. Shot down, not an accident. Blown out of the sky,"" he said.

The Boeing 777-200 departed Amsterdam at 12.14am local time bound for Kuala Lumpur, 15 minutes later than scheduled, according to flight records.

It should have arrived in Malaysia at 6:10am local time, but did not enter Russian airspace when it was expected to, a Russian aviation source told Reuters.

The Eurocontrol organsiation, which co-ordinates European air traffic control, closed air routes in eastern Ukraine on Thursday evening.

The incident came one day after US President Barack Obama levied broad economic sanctions on Russia as punishment for its threatening behaviour towards Ukraine.

Amid tensions in the region, Russian President Vladmir Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash, the Kremlin said in a statement early on Friday.

Putin opened a meeting with his economic advisers by calling for a moment of silence over the crash, but added: ""This tragedy would not have happened if there were peace on this land, if the military actions had not been renewed in southeast Ukraine. And, certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.""

Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels and the Ukraine government have accused each other of carrying out the ground-to-air strike, with both issuing firm denials of any involvement in the disaster.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko responding by calling the crash a ""terrorist"" attack which posed a challenge to the whole world, his website said.

""Today's tragedy showed again that terrorism is not localised, but a world problem. And the external aggression against Ukraine is not just our problem, but a threat to European and global security,"" he said.

Shortly after the crash, rebel leader Alexander Borodai told the RIA-Novosti agency that discussions were under way with Ukrainian authorities on calling a three-day cease fire for humanitarian reasons.

He added that international organisations would be allowed into the region.

Prior to the suggestion of a truce, the Poroshenko rejected claims by Ukraine rebels that Kiev was responsible and said his country's armed forces did not shoot at any airborne targets.

“We do not exclude that this plane was shot down, and we stress that the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not take action against any airborne targets,” he said.

“We are sure that those who are guilty in this tragedy will be held responsible,"" he added.

An official statement from the Ukraine government blamed Russian air defence systems it claimed are protecting ""terrorists"" in the area.

It said: ""A large passenger aircraft Boeing 777, performing a flight between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, was shot down in the eastern part of Ukraine. According to the General Staff of Ukrainian Armed Forces, the plane was shot down by the Russian Buk missile system as the liner was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters.

""Ukraine has no long-range air defence missile systems in this area.

""The plane was shot down, because the Russian air defence systems was affording protection to Russian mercenaries and terrorists in this area.

""Ukraine will present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.

""The leader of the terrorists Igor Girkin (Strelkov) immediately commented on the catastrophe, believing that it was the Ukrainian jet that crashed: 'In Torez An-26 was shot down, its crashes are lying somewhere near the coal mine “Progress”. We have warned everyone: do not fly in our skies,'"" the statement read.

Anton Gerashenko, an aide to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the Boeing airliner, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was at an altitude of 33,000ft when it was hit by a missile fired from a Buk launcher and crashed near the city of Donetsk - a stronghold of pro-Russian rebels.

But Russia’s military said that none of its military planes had been flying close to the Russia-Ukraine border on Thursday, RIA Novosti reported citing a military official.

Earlier, Aleksandr Boroday, Prime Minister of the recently established Donetsk People's Republic, denied the jet had been shot down by the rebels and called the incident a “provocation by the Ukrainian military”.

“We confirm that the plane crashed not far from Donetsk,” Boroday said. “Representatives of Donetsk People's Republic have headed to the scene.”

“Self-defence forces have no air-defence, which could target transport aircraft at that height,” he told Interfax.

In separate reports by Interfax, an unidentified pro-Russian separatists said they had found the jet's black box flight recorder.

The Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has ordered an investigation into what he has called an ""airplane catastrophe"", his spokeswoman Olga Lappo said on Thursday.

Elsewhere, world leaders issued statements expressing their shock, and calling for potential culprits to be brought to justice.

President Obama called the crash a ""terrible tragedy"", and said his government's priority was to determine whether any Americans were killed.

During a pre-planned phone conversation, Obama and Putin discussed the crash, the White House and Kremlin both confirmed.

Meanwhile, US senator John McCain warned that there will be “hell to pay” if the Russia military or Ukrainian separatists are deemed to have had any involvement in the 'incident'.

“If the Malaysian plane was shot down, this is obviously a game changer and has horrific consequences,"" he warned.

“It has the earmarks of a tragic mistake made by someone who had the capability to just shoot down an aircraft, and we know at least from the last couple of weeks that that could be Russian or separatist Russian capability.”

""But if it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly believing this was a Ukrainian war plane, I think there’s going to be hell to pay and there should be,"" he said in an interview on MSNBC, citing previous reports of separatists shooting down Ukrainian fighter planes.

His comments followed a tweet by the Malaysian Prime Minister, following his later statement, in which he said he was ""shocked"" by reports of a plane crash, and that an investigation was being launched into the incident immediately.

As pictures emerged showing loved ones of those on board the flight gathering at both Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Sepang, and Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands Prime Minister Marke Rutte also said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the crash, NL Times reported.

""I am deeply shocked by the tragic news about the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur via Ukrainian territory,” he said.

“Very much is still unclear about the facts, the circumstances and the passengers.”

Late on Thursday, newly appointed Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for an UN-led international investigation to establish what caused the flight to crash, with a meeting of the Government's emergency committee - Cobra - expected to meet on Friday.

""I'm deeply shocked by this appalling incident and I send my heartfelt condolences to all those who may have lost family and friends. We're determined to get to the bottom of understanding what has happened here,"" he said.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement that if the plane crash was deliberate, it constituted an ""unspeakable crime"" for which the perpetrators must be swiftly brought to justice.

""It is a very, very sad time, made worse by reports that it might be a crime rather than an accident,"" Abbott said.

Shortly after the crash, Malaysia Airlines posted a tweet on its official account confirming it had ""lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam"".

""The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow.""

It said early on Friday that all of its European flights will take routes avoiding Ukraine.

Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow. — Malaysia Airlines (@MAS) July 17, 2014

Virgin Airlines, Lufthansa and British Airways have confirmed that they are diverting most of their flights away from Ukrainian airspace.

A spokesman from BA said: “The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority. Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace, with the exception of our once a day service between Heathrow and Kiev.""",34043
693116426824093696,non-rumor,Most companies pay little attention to how employees are feeling. This is a mistake. https://t.co/a8rMB0OunN https://t.co/HJdTxDfdTM,http://s.hbr.org/1RIZYZY,True,Manage Your Emotional Culture,"By not only allowing emotions into the workplace but also consciously shaping them, leaders can better motivate their employees. This article describes some of the ways emotional culture manifests at work—for instance, in the form of joy, companionate love, and fear—and the impact it can have in a range of settings and industries. It also suggests ways of creating and maintaining an emotional culture that will help you achieve your company’s goals.

Barsade and O’Neill have found that emotional culture influences employee satisfaction, burnout, teamwork, and even “hard” measures such as financial performance and absenteeism. So when managers ignore or fail to understand it, they’re glossing over a vital component of what makes organizations tick, and their companies suffer as a result.

Most companies don’t realize how central emotions are to building the right culture. They tend to focus on cognitive culture: the shared intellectual values, norms, artifacts, and assumptions that set the overall tone for how employees think and behave at work. Though that’s incredibly important, the authors’ research shows that it’s only part of the story. The other critical part is emotional culture, which governs which feelings people have and express at work.

Idea in Brief The Problem Most companies pay little attention to their emotional culture—which feelings people have (and should have) at work, and which ones they keep to themselves. That presents problems for both individuals and organizations. The Reason Research shows that, for better or worse, emotions influence employees’ commitment, creativity, decision making, work quality, and likelihood of sticking around—and you can see the effects on the bottom line. So it’s important to monitor and manage people’s feelings as deliberately as you do their mindset. The Solution Once you have a handle on your existing emotional culture, you can shape it in several ways. Explicitly say which emotions will help the organization thrive, channel the feelings that people have and express naturally, and cultivate the ones you want through emotional contagion and the power of “deep acting.”

Before leaving work each day, employees at Ubiquity Retirement + Savings press a button in the lobby. They’re not punching out—not in the traditional sense, anyway. They’re actually registering their emotions. They have five buttons to choose from: a smiley face if they felt happy at work that day, a frowny face if they felt sad, and so on.

This may sound like an HR gimmick (“See? Management cares how you feel!”) or an instrument of forced satisfaction (“The team with the most smiley faces wins!”). But it’s neither. Ubiquity is using the data it collects to understand what motivates employees—to learn what makes them feel a sense of belonging and excitement at work. Other organizations are starting to do the same. Some use apps that record how much fun people are having. Some hire technology consultants who specialize in the monthly, weekly, daily, or even hourly tracking of moods. Unfortunately, though, these organizations are in the minority. Most companies pay little attention to how employees are—or should be—feeling. They don’t realize how central emotions are to building the right culture.

When people talk about corporate culture, they’re typically referring to cognitive culture: the shared intellectual values, norms, artifacts, and assumptions that serve as a guide for the group to thrive. Cognitive culture sets the tone for how employees think and behave at work—for instance, how customer-focused, innovative, team-oriented, or competitive they are or should be.

Cognitive culture is undeniably important to an organization’s success. But it’s only part of the story. The other critical part is what we call the group’s emotional culture: the shared affective values, norms, artifacts, and assumptions that govern which emotions people have and express at work and which ones they are better off suppressing. Though the key distinction here is thinking versus feeling, the two types of culture are also transmitted differently: Cognitive culture is often conveyed verbally, whereas emotional culture tends to be conveyed through nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expression.

Despite a renaissance of scholarship (dubbed “the affective revolution”) on the ways that emotions shape people’s behavior at work, emotional culture is rarely managed as deliberately as cognitive culture—and often it’s not managed at all. Companies suffer as a result. Employees who should be showing compassion (in health care, for example) become callous and indifferent. Teams that would benefit from joy and pride instead tolerate a culture of anger. People who lack a healthy amount of fear (say, in security firms or investment banks) act recklessly. The effects can be especially damaging during times of upheaval, such as organizational restructurings and financial downturns.

In our research over the past decade, we have found that emotional culture influences employee satisfaction, burnout, teamwork, and even hard measures such as financial performance and absenteeism. Countless empirical studies show the significant impact of emotions on how people perform on tasks, how engaged and creative they are, how committed they are to their organizations, and how they make decisions. Positive emotions are consistently associated with better performance, quality, and customer service—this holds true across roles and industries and at various organizational levels. On the flip side (with certain short-term exceptions), negative emotions such as group anger, sadness, fear, and the like usually lead to negative outcomes, including poor performance and high turnover.

Every organization has an emotional culture, even if it’s one of suppression.

So when managers ignore emotional culture, they’re glossing over a vital part of what makes people—and organizations—tick. They may understand its importance in theory but can still shy away from emotions at work. Leaders expect to influence how people think and behave on the job, but they may feel ill equipped to understand and actively manage how employees feel and express their emotions at work. Or they may regard doing so as irrelevant, not part of their job, or unprofessional.

In our interviews with executives and employees, some people have told us that their organizations lack emotion altogether. But every organization has an emotional culture, even if it’s one of suppression. By not only allowing emotions into the workplace, but also understanding and consciously shaping them, leaders can better motivate their employees. In this article we’ll illustrate some of the ways in which emotional culture manifests at work and the impact it can have in a range of settings, from health care and emergency services to finance, consulting, and high tech. Drawing on our findings, we’ll also suggest ways of creating and maintaining an emotional culture that will help you achieve your company’s larger goals.

Delving Beneath the Surface

Some companies have begun to explicitly include emotions in their management principles. For instance, PepsiCo, Southwest Airlines, Whole Foods Market, The Container Store, and Zappos all list love or caring among their corporate values. Similarly, C&S Wholesale Grocers, Camden Property Trust, Cisco Finance, Ubiquity, and Vail Resorts, along with many start-ups, highlight the importance of fun to their success.

But to get a comprehensive read on an organization’s emotional culture and then deliberately manage it, you have to make sure that what is codified in mission statements and on corporate badges is also enacted in the “micromoments” of daily organizational life. These consist of small gestures rather than bold declarations of feeling. For example, little acts of kindness and support can add up to an emotional culture characterized by caring and compassion.

Facial expressions and body language are equally powerful. If a manager consistently comes to work looking angry (whether he means to or not), he may cultivate a culture of anger. This phenomenon is surprisingly common: In one study, Don Gibson, the dean and a professor of management at Fairfield University’s Dolan School of Business, found that working professionals from multiple organizations actually felt more comfortable expressing anger than joy on the job (they reported expressing anger three times as often). You can imagine the ripple effects.

Office décor and furnishings, too, may suggest what’s expected or appropriate emotionally. Photos of employees laughing at social events or action figures perched on cubicle walls can signal a culture of joy. Signs with lists of rules and consequences for breaking them can reflect a culture of fear. Comfy chairs and tissues in small conference rooms convey that it’s OK to bare your soul or cry if you need to.

But as Edgar Schein, a professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School, has shown with his popular “three levels of culture” model, the most deeply entrenched elements of organizational culture are the least visible. Take, for instance, the deep underlying assumption that pitting employees against one another gets the best work out of them. That’s not the kind of thing managers publicize; sometimes they’re even unaware that they are fostering this dynamic. And yet it’s felt by leaders and employees alike. While it may result in healthy competition, it’s just as likely to create a strong culture of envy, which can erode trust and undermine employees’ ability to collaborate.

Emotional Cultures in Action

Nearly 30 years ago the social psychologist Phil Shaver and his colleagues found that people can reliably distinguish among 135 emotions. But understanding the most basic ones—joy, love, anger, fear, sadness—is a good place to start for any leader trying to manage an emotional culture. Here are a few examples to illustrate how these emotions can play out in organizations.

A culture of joy.

Let’s begin with one that’s often clearly articulated and actively reinforced by management—above the surface and easy to spot. Vail Resorts recognizes that cultivating joy among employees helps customers have fun too, which matters a lot in the hospitality business. It also gives the organization an edge in retaining top talent in an extremely competitive industry. “Have fun” is listed as a company value and modeled by Vail’s CEO, Rob Katz—who, for instance, had ice water dumped on his head during a corporate ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and then jumped fully clothed into a pool. About 250 executives and other employees followed his lead.

Tracking Emotions Companies have started using apps like Niko Niko to help individual employees and teams log their emotional reactions to various activities and make the connection between their moods and productivity.

This playful spirit at the top permeates Vail. Management tactics, special outings, celebrations, and rewards all support the emotional culture. Resort managers consistently model joy and prescribe it for their teams. During the workday they give out pins when they notice employees spontaneously having fun or helping others enjoy their jobs. Rather than asking people to follow standardized customer service scripts, they tell everyone to “go out there and have fun.” Mark Gasta, the company’s chief people officer, says he regularly sees ski-lift operators dancing, making jokes, doing “whatever it takes to have fun and entertain the guest” while ensuring a safe experience on the slopes. On a day-to-day basis, Vail encourages employees to collaborate, because, as Gasta points out, “leaving people out is not fun.” At an annual ceremony, a Have Fun award goes to whoever led that year’s best initiative promoting fun at work. The resort also fosters off-the-job joy with “first tracks” (first access to the ski slopes for employees), adventure trips, and frequent social gatherings.

All this is in service to an emotional culture that makes intuitive sense. (Joy at a ski resort? Of course.) But now consider an organization where the demand for joy wasn’t immediately visible. When we surveyed employees at Cisco Finance about their organization’s emotional culture, it became clear to management that fostering joy should be a priority. The survey didn’t ask employees how they felt at work; it asked them what emotions they saw their coworkers expressing on a regular basis. (By having employees report on colleagues’ emotions, researchers could obtain a more objective, bird’s-eye view of the culture.) It turned out that joy was one of the strongest drivers of employee satisfaction and commitment at the company—and more of it was needed to keep up engagement.

So management made joy an explicit cultural value, calling it “Pause for Fun.” This signaled that it was an important outcome to track—just like productivity, creativity, and other elements of performance. Many companies use annual employee engagement surveys to gauge joy in the abstract, often in the form of job satisfaction and commitment to the organization. But Cisco Finance measured it much more specifically and is conducting follow-up surveys to track whether it is actually increasing. In addition, leaders throughout the organization support this cultural value with their own behavior—for example, by creating humorous videos that show them pausing for fun.

A culture of companionate love.

Another emotion we’ve examined extensively—one that’s common in life but rarely mentioned by name in organizations—is companionate love. This is the degree of affection, caring, and compassion that employees feel and express toward one another.

In a 16-month study of a large long-term-care facility on the East Coast, we found that workers in units with strong cultures of companionate love had lower absenteeism, less burnout, and greater teamwork and job satisfaction than their colleagues in other units. Employees also performed their work better, as demonstrated by more-satisfied patients, better patient moods, and fewer unnecessary trips to the emergency room. (Employees whose dispositions were positive to begin with received an extra performance boost from the culture.) The families of patients in units with stronger cultures of companionate love reported higher satisfaction with the facility. These results show a powerful connection between emotional culture and business performance.

Because this study took place in a health care setting, we wondered whether companionate love matters only in “helping” industries. So we surveyed more than 3,200 employees in 17 organizations spanning seven industries: biopharmaceutical, engineering, financial services, higher education, public utilities, real estate, and travel. In organizations where employees felt and expressed companionate love toward one another, people reported greater job satisfaction, commitment, and personal accountability for work performance.

Take Censeo, a consulting firm that has deliberately cultivated a culture of companionate love. Cofounder and CEO Raj Sharma wanted to build a company that made authentic connections with clients. Along the way, Sharma realized that this strategy, which increased clients’ trust and the firm’s impact, was also critical to Censeo’s organizational culture.

Now the firm hires people who will help sustain its culture; that means turning away some really smart people who would destroy it. Censeo also encourages employees to cultivate genuine relationships by interacting socially both at and outside work. The message seems to be getting through: When asked to describe colleagues at the firm, one junior analyst called them “my friends.” Employees also hold themselves accountable for treating one another with compassion. They’ll confront colleagues—including those above them in the hierarchy—for blatantly disregarding the feelings of others or frequently blowing up at coworkers.

A culture of fear.

Of course, organizations can be defined by negative emotions as well. In Turn the Ship Around! the retired Navy captain L. David Marquet describes how a culture of fear plagued the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear submarine that suffered under extreme command-and-control leadership before he took over. The crew had low morale and the worst retention rate in the fleet.

Nuclear submarines must accomplish their missions while maintaining security and safety, so performance depends in large part on the skill and judgment of the crew. Marquet argues that the constant fear of being yelled at—for making mistakes, not knowing things, challenging authority, and so on—made it harder for sailors to think well and act quickly. This view is backed by research that the Berkeley professor emeritus Barry Staw and his colleagues have done on “threat rigidity” (the tendency to narrow one’s focus under threat) and by findings on the impact of excessive stress on the prefrontal cortex: It impairs executive functions such as judgment, memory, and impulse control.

Marquet changed that emotional culture by using classic “high involvement” management techniques, such as empowering crew members to make decisions and not punishing them for every misstep. As a result, they became more confident and accountable—and less inclined to simply wait for permission or directions from their commanding officer. The transformation paid off. Marquet led the ship from low-performing to award-winning, and 10 of his top 20 officers later went on to become submarine captains.

What Happens When Emotions Intersect

Clearly, fear can be toxic, but even positive emotions can have unintended side effects if given too much sway. In a culture of unmitigated joy, fun might impede work. In a culture of love, where everyone feels like family, employees might struggle to have honest conversations about problems. To quote one person we interviewed, “People don’t want to talk about conflict because they don’t want to get in the way of the love.”

Sometimes organizations avoid those problems because multiple emotions balance one another out. For example, in a comprehensive study of firefighters’ organizational culture (conducted by one of us, Olivia O’Neill, and Nancy Rothbard, a professor at Wharton), two emotions came through quite strongly. Participants described a culture of joviality, expressed mainly through elaborate jokes and pranks. (They said their most important rule for hiring someone new was “No stiffs.”) But that coexisted with a culture of companionate love, which the researchers hadn’t expected to see in a typically masculine profession. The firefighters supported one another emotionally—offering words of encouragement when someone was struggling after a tough call, for example, or was going through a painful divorce. They also offered nonverbal gestures of affection, such as a bear hug for someone who was choked up over a personal issue.

There were reasons for both emotional cultures to be strong: Joviality helped teams coordinate better on the job, because all the pranks had honed their understanding of individuals’ weaknesses (anthropologists would call this an evolutionary advantage of play). Monitoring and managing those weaknesses is particularly important in fast-moving, high-stress, or dangerous situations. And companionate love helped the firefighters heal from the traumatic events endemic in their jobs.

Like any other emotion, companionate love can lead to varying outcomes, depending on what it’s paired with. For the firefighters, it had a tempering effect on the joviality and teasing, which—if taken to extremes—could become isolating and hurtful.

Another example of how emotions intersect comes from our research with the Católica-Lisbon professor Francesco Sguera. In a study of a major medical center in the United States, we found that the emotional culture was largely defined by anxiety and anger. The medical center’s punishment-based “point system” reinforced the anxiety: “If you call in sick, you get a point,” an employee wrote. “If you are one minute late for work, you get a point. We often feel that we are liabilities to the department, as disposable as gauze.” The rampant anxiety led to many negative outcomes, including poor financial performance, burnout, and low job satisfaction. However, in units where a strong culture of anxiety was coupled with companionate love, employee performance and attitudes matched those in units with lower anxiety. The culture of companionate love essentially served as an antidote to the culture of anxiety. It reduced the negative impact on the bottom line—specifically, on gross profit margin—by offsetting the ill effects on employee attitudes and behavior. Although employees expressed a lot of anxiety and saw it all around them, knowing that they were cared for by their colleagues helped them to deal with it.

Creating an Emotional Culture

To cultivate a particular emotional culture, you’ll need to get people to feel the emotions valued by the organization or team—or at least to behave as if they do. Here are three effective methods:

Harness what people already feel.

Some employees will experience the desired emotions quite naturally. This can happen in isolated moments of compassion or gratitude, for example. When such feelings arise regularly, that’s a sign you’re building the culture you want. If people have them periodically and need help sustaining them, you can try incorporating some gentle nudges during the workday. You might schedule some time for meditation, for instance; or provide mindfulness apps on people’s work devices to remind them to simply breathe, relax, or laugh; or create a kudos board, like the one in an ICU we studied, where people can post kind words about other employees.

But what can you do about emotions that are toxic to the culture you’re striving for? How can you discourage them when they already exist? Expecting people to “put a lid” on those feelings is both ineffective and destructive; the emotions will just come out later in counterproductive ways. It’s important to listen when employees express their concerns so that they feel they are being heard. That’s not to say you should encourage venting, or just let the emotions flow with no attempt at solving the root problems. Indeed, research shows that extended venting can lead to poor outcomes. You’re better off helping employees think about situations in a more constructive way. For example, loneliness, which can eat away at employee attitudes and performance, is best addressed through cognitive reappraisal—getting people to reexamine their views of others’ actions. Considering plausible benign motivations for their colleagues’ behavior will make them less likely to fixate on negative explanations that could send them into a spiral.

Model the emotions you want to cultivate.

A long line of research on emotional contagion shows that people in groups “catch” feelings from others through behavioral mimicry and subsequent changes in brain function. If you regularly walk into a room smiling with high energy, you’re much more likely to create a culture of joy than if you wear a neutral expression. Your employees will smile back and start to mean it.

But negative feelings, too, spread like wildfire. If you frequently express frustration, that emotion will infect your team members, and their team members, and so on throughout the organization. Before you know it, you’ll have created a culture of frustration.

People in groups “catch” feelings from others.

So consciously model the emotions you want to cultivate in your company. Some organizations go a step further and explicitly ask employees to spread certain emotions. Ubiquity Retirement + Savings says, “Inspire happiness with contagious enthusiasm. Own your joy and lend it out.” Vail Resorts says, “Enjoy your work and share the contagious spirit.”

Get people to fake it till they feel it.

If employees don’t experience the desired emotion at a particular moment, they can still help maintain their organization’s emotional culture. That’s because people express emotions both spontaneously and strategically at work. Social psychology research has long shown that individuals tend to conform to group norms of emotional expression, imitating others out of a desire to be liked and accepted. So employees in a strong emotional culture who would not otherwise feel and express the valued emotion will begin to demonstrate it—even if their initial motivation is to be compliant rather than to internalize the culture.

This benefits the organization, not just the individuals trying to thrive in it. In early anthropological studies of group rituals, strategic emotional expression was found to facilitate group cohesion by overpowering individual feelings and synchronizing interpersonal behavior.

Cultural Artifacts An organization’s physical environment can send cues—subtle or strong—about which feelings employees do and should express at work. Here are some examples:

1 This coworking space for technology start-ups reflects a culture of joy and fun. Note the robo-cocktail posters and drones parked on the wall.

2 An intensive care unit at one university hospital has a culture of fear: Employees must stay silent so as not to disturb critically ill patients.

3 But fear and sadness in the ICU are mitigated by companionate love, reflected in this “kudos” board for employees.

So maintaining the appropriate culture sometimes entails disregarding what you are truly feeling. Through “surface acting,” employees can display the valued emotion without even wanting to feel it. Surface acting isn’t a long-term solution, though. Research shows that it can eventually lead to burnout—particularly in the absence of any outlet for authentic emotions.

A better way to cultivate a desired emotion is through “deep acting.” With this technique, people make a focused effort to feel a certain way, and then suddenly they do. Imagine that an employee at an accounting firm has a family emergency and requests a week off work at the height of tax audit season. Although his boss’s first thought is No—not now—no! she could engage in deep acting to change her immediate feelings of justifiable panic into genuine caring and concern for her subordinate. By trying hard to empathize, saying “Of course you should go be with your family!” and using the same facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice she would use when actually feeling those emotions, she could coax herself into the real thing. She would also be modeling a desired behavior for the subordinate and the rest of the team.

Fortunately, all these ways of creating an emotional culture—whether they involve really feeling the emotion or simply acting that way—can reinforce one another and strengthen the culture’s norms. People don’t have to put on an act forever. Those who begin by expressing an emotion out of a desire to conform will start to actually feel it through emotional contagion. They’ll also receive positive reinforcement for following the norms, which will make them more likely to demonstrate the emotion again.

Of course, the culture will be much stronger and more likely to endure if people truly believe in the values and assumptions behind it. Someone who is uncomfortable with an organization’s emotional culture and has to keep pretending in order to be successful would probably be better off moving to a different work environment. Companies often have more than one emotional culture, so another unit or department might be a good fit. But if the culture is homogeneous, the employee may want to leave the company entirely.

Implementation Matters at All Levels

Just like other aspects of organizational culture, emotional culture should be supported at all levels of the organization. The role of top management is to drive it.

Leaders are often insufficiently aware of how much influence they have in creating an emotional culture. Traci Fenton is the founder and CEO of WorldBlu, a consulting firm that tackles fear at work. She shares this example: At one Fortune 500 company, unbeknownst to the CEO, senior employees regularly use text message codes to describe his nonverbal expressions of anger in meetings. “RED” means he is getting red in the face. “VEIN” means his veins are popping out. “ACP,” which stands for “assume the crash position,” means he is about to start throwing things. This leader is very effective at creating an emotional culture—but it’s probably not the one he wants.

So don’t underestimate the importance of day-to-day modeling. Large, symbolic emotional gestures are powerful, but only if they are in line with daily behavior. Senior executives can also shape an emotional culture through organizational practices. Take “compassionate firing,” which is common at companies that build a strong culture of companionate love. Carlos Gutierrez, the vice president of R&D systems at Lattice Semiconductor, was deeply concerned about the impact of layoffs on his employees. He recognized that the traditional HR protocol of asking terminated employees to clean out their desks immediately and leave the premises would be especially painful to people who had worked side by side for 10 to 20 years. Along with his partners in HR and R&D, he implemented a protocol whereby employees had an extended time to say good-bye to their colleagues and to commemorate their time together at the company. Also, although two-thirds of the R&D workforce is outside the United States, Sherif Sweha, the corporate vice president of R&D, believed it was important for the affected team members in each region to receive the news from a senior leader face-to-face. So he and members of his staff flew to the company’s sites in Asia to have in-person conversations with all the employees to be laid off—and also those who would remain with the company.

Though top management sets the first example and establishes the formal rules, middle managers and frontline supervisors ensure that the emotional values are consistently practiced by others. Because one of the biggest influences on employees is their immediate boss, the suggestions that apply to senior executives also apply to those managers: They should ensure that the emotions they express at work reflect the chosen culture, and they should speak explicitly about what is expected from employees.

It’s also important to link the emotional culture to operations and processes, including performance management systems. At Vail Resorts the culture of joy has been incorporated into the annual review, which indicates how well each employee integrates fun into the work environment and rates everyone on supporting behaviors, such as being inclusive, welcoming, approachable, and positive. Someone who exceeds expectations is described as not only taking part in the fun but also offering “recommendations to improve the work environment to integrate fun.”

Decades’ worth of research demonstrates the importance of organizational culture, yet most of it has focused on the cognitive component. As we’ve shown, organizations also have an emotional pulse, and managers must track it closely to motivate their teams and reach their goals.

Emotional culture is shaped by how all employees—from the highest echelons to the front lines—comport themselves day in and day out. But it’s up to senior leaders to establish which emotions will help the organization thrive, model those emotions, and reward others for doing the same. Companies in which they do this have a lot to gain.",31659

Australian coat of arms clearly visible. http://t.co/ai16vY46FV http://t.co/JA0gjQt3P5,http://bit.ly/1jUoGaC,True,Malaysia Airlines plane MH17 ‘shot down’ on Ukraine-Russia border,"Evidence is growing that a surface-to-air missile brought down a Malaysia Airlines flight that has crashed in Ukraine killing all on board.

THE Russian government has allegedly been busted editing a Wikipedia entry on the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 disaster to blame Ukraine.

A Twitter bot which monitors edits made on the site by Russian government IP addresses picked up the changes which were made on a page listing civil aviation accidents, the UK’s Telegraph reported.

The original entry stated that the plane was shot down “by terrorists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic with Buk system missiles, which the terrorists received from the Russian Federation”.

It was changed to read: “the plane [flight MH17] was shot down by Ukrainian soldiers”.

The Twitter bot issued this alert:

Статья в Википедии Список авиационных катастроф в гражданской авиации была отредактирована ВГТРК http://t.co/peZ60q07Fj — Госправки (@RuGovEdits) July 18, 2014

It translates to: “Wikipedia article List of aircraft accidents in civil aviation has been edited by RTR [another name for VGTRK]”.

‘Security zone’ agreed upon

Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels have agreed to set up a security zone around the crash site, Ukraine’s security service chief said.

Internationally mediated talks “concluded with an agreement to set up a 20-kilometre security zone so that Ukraine could fulfil the most important thing — identify the bodies (and) hand them over to relatives,” Ukrainian Security Service head Valentyn Nalyvaychenko said in televised remarks.

‘Justice for the dead and living’

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has told of the difficulty of investigations into the downed MH17 flight, saying it will be weeks before there are answers for the victims’ families.

He said Australian officials have been deployed to the region.

“Yesterday we saw the smouldering wreckage on our screens, today we have seen some of the faces of the dead,” he said.

“As a nation we need to prepare ourselves for difficult and painful weeks ahead as we strive to find out precisely what has happened and who is responsible.

“My aim is to get justice for Australia, in particular to get justice for the dead and the living. The only way to get justice is if there is a thorough investigation and that means getting access to the site as swiftly as possible ... it’s imperative that the site is made available to investigators without molestation and hindrance as fast as possible.”

Abbott said the area is controlled by rebels and “bodies remain strewn over the fields of Eastern Ukraine”.

He emphasised just how dangerous the situation is.

“Overnight, a monitoring mission from the organisation for the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe did gain temporary access but it was driven off by gunfire presumably from the Russian-backed rebels.

“This does highlight though the difficulty and danger of this mission.”

Attempts to contact the Russian government have been unsuccessful so far.

The Ukraine government had said it would give Australia all the support it needed to access the site to retrieve bodies and protect evidence.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will be heading to the US to champion Australia’s campaign at the UN Security Council for an independent comprehensive international investigation with access to the site, debris, black box and any possible witnesses.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have deployed six officers to Kiev and more are on their way, including a five-member emergency response team. Australian Federal Police investigators are also on their way, and more are ready to be deployed as the situation develops.

Contingency arrangements have been put in place to repatriate the bodies, he added.

“Although I must caution this is likely to be weeks, rather than days ahead.”

Ms Bishop noted that for the investigation to proceed, a cease fire around the crash site would be required.

Qantas and Virgin have offered their support for any Australians travelling to the site.

Meanwhile, the Government doesn’t want the MH17 disaster to distract from its G20 agenda despite growing pressure for Australia to bar Russia from attending the forum later this year.

The downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has overshadowed the opening of the G20 trade ministers meeting in Sydney on Saturday, where top officials from the world’s 20 richest nations including Russia have gathered to discuss economic growth.

Treasurer Joe Hockey said there was a “steely determination” to find out who was responsible for the disaster but also not to allow it to distract from the task facing G20 ministers.

“There’s no doubt the events are tragic, just tragic,” Mr Hockey said in Sydney ahead of the G20 meeting.

“But we have to move on with the world, bring those people to justice that were responsible for that horrendous act, but also not allow it to distract us from the challenge of creating a world that has greater prosperity and freedom.”

Nearly 300 people — including 28 Australians — were killed when MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. Suspicion has fallen on Russian-backed rebels, prompting calls for Moscow to be punished with trade sanctions.

Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who met with his Russian counterpart Alexey Ulyukaev ahead of chairing the G20 meeting, didn’t rule out the prospect of trade sanctions if Russia didn’t play ball.

“These are things we need to consider in the goodness of time,” Mr Robb said.

“It is a matter of how Russia responds, co-operates and is proactive in seeking answers.”

Malaysian prime minister’s grief

The step-grandmother of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was on board MH17, the country’s defence minister confirmed.

Hishammuddin Hussein, a cousin of Najib’s, said 83-year-old Siti Amirah was “on the flight”. Siti Amirah was also Hishammuddin’s step-grandmother.

“Pls pray 4 her,” he wrote on his Twitter feed above a photo of her in an Islamic headscarf.

#MH17 my step grandmother was on the flight . Pls pray 4 her . pic.twitter.com/vIyYXOqWbC — Hishammuddin Hussein (@HishammuddinH2O) July 19, 2014

The defence minister’s tweet today confirmed an earlier report in the Star newspaper that said Siti Amirah had embarked alone in Amsterdam on board flight MH17 en route to the Indonesian city of Jogjakarta.

She was scheduled to transit at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

Bizarre account

A top pro-Russia rebel commander in eastern Ukraine has given a bizarre version of events surrounding the Malaysian jetliner crash - suggesting many of the victims may have died days before the plane took off.

The pro-rebel website Russkaya Vesna quoted Igor Girkin as saying he was told by people at the crash site that “a significant number of the bodies weren’t fresh,” adding that he was told they were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.

Air travel warning

Pilots and aircraft operators are being warned by the Australian aviation regulator to avoid flying over eastern Ukraine, following similar advice from US and European air safety agencies.

No Australian planes are presently scheduled to fly above eastern Ukraine where MH17 was shot down by a suspected surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people on board.

“Australian air operators and pilots considering operations in eastern European airspace (should) take into account all available safety notices and bulletins regarding flights in the Ukraine region,” the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said.

“Particular attention should be given to notices issued by the United States Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency.” US aircraft have been prohibited by the country’s Federal Aviation Administration from flying above parts of eastern Ukraine. “The restricted area includes the entire Simferopol and Dnepropetrovsk ... regions,” the FAA said.

“This action expands a prohibition of US flight operations issued by the FAA in April, over the Crimean region of Ukraine and adjacent areas of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.”

First photo of pilot

Details of the pilots of downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 have been revealed.

The plane with 298 people on board, including at least 28 Australians, was downed about 12.15am Sydney time yesterday.

The flight MH17, a Boeing 777-200, was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur but was shot down in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine.

The two captains on the plane were Eugene Choo Jin Leong, 45, and Wan Amran Wan Hussin, 50, according to a list.

A photograph of Leong shows him alongside a motorbike. A family member of Leong’s, who did not want to be named, confirmed that he was on board the plane. Meanwhile, Captain Wan Amran Wan Hussin’s wife reportedly told the New Straits Times that he had contacted her minutes before he boarded the flight.

The mother-of-two was shocked to learn what had happened when she randomly checked her phone.

“I had just finished my prayers and decided to checked my handphone as the battery had earlier gone flat.

“I was shocked to see a message from my children’s ustaz (religious teacher) informing me that a Malaysia Airlines plane had crashed.

“I was taken aback and immediately switched on the television to see what was going on.”

Nationalities of victims

Malaysia Airlines has released a new list of the nationalities of passengers who lost their lives on MH17. It lists 27 Australian lives lost — while the number according to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is 28, including a dual-citizen.

• Netherlands: 189

• Malaysia: 44

• Australia: 27

• Indonesia: 12

• UK: 9

• Belgium: 4

• Germany: 4

• Philippines: 3

• Canada: 1

• New Zealand: 1

Four passengers’ nationalities have not yet been verified.

The full list of names have been released in the flight manifesto.

Day of mourning

Several hundred members of an exclusive Sydney school community have gathered at a church in the city’s east to hold a special mass for a much-loved teacher killed in the MH17 attack.

Sydney nun Sister Philomene Tiernan was on board the Malaysia Airlines flight

Sister Philomene worked for more than 30 years as a teacher and director of boarding at Catholic school Kincoppal-Rose Bay and was remembered fondly by students yesterday.

“The impact of this is just unbelievable in the whole community,” a year 12 student who did not want to be named said. On a cold Saturday morning several nuns, students and their parents and associates of the school arrived at Saint Mary Magdalene church in Rose Bay for a special mass.

Parish Priest Monsignor Tony Doherty said the special prayer service, which began at 9am, would “focus our grief and loss of such an extraordinary woman.”

The world has been rocked by the tragedy, with people attending a range of memorial sites.

‘Ban Putin from G20’

Australia should consider uninviting Russian President Vladimir Putin from the Brisbane G20 meeting over his government’s “reckless and stupid” actions leading up to the MH17 disaster, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says.

Mr Shorten said he was fully supportive of the Australian government’s strong stance over the apparent downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

“For an outside nation to have supplied these Ukrainian rebels with this weaponry of war and murder is a very, very reckless and stupid act,” he told reporters in Melbourne on Saturday.

“It is in the interests of resolving what has happened that all of the great powers, including the Russian Federation, support what was said at the United Nations Security Council last night.” The council called for a thorough investigation of the crash. Mr Shorten said the Australian government should consider barring Mr Putin from the upcoming G20 meeting in Brisbane if the country did not support the investigation.

“If the Russian Federation will not co-operate to help resolve and get to the heart of what has happened here, I don’t think Australians would welcome them coming to the G20,” he said.

Royal condolences

Prince William has expressed his sympathy for all those affected by the disaster, noting in particular the impact on Australians.

Speaking at Australia House in London, the Duke of Cambridge spoke of his great sadness.

“For all of us who have lost fellow countrymen and women in the tragedy, words cannot do justice to our sense of loss,” he said. “For Australians, for our Malaysian brothers and sisters in the Commonwealth, the crash is a particularly cruel tragedy, coming so soon after the loss of MH370.” He said his family’s thoughts and prayers were with everyone affected.

The Duke was at Australia House to unveil a statue of Matthew Flinders, the first explorer to circumnavigate Australia.

Australian High Commissioner to London Alexander Downer also spoke about the tragedy, asking for a moment’s silence for those killed.

Obama speaks out

US President Barack Obama has sent his condolences to the families of victims. He has also paid tribute to AIDS researchers and activists who were bound for an international conference in Melbourne.

The president phoned Prime Minister Tony Abbott to discuss the tragedy.

“The president expressed condolences on behalf of the American people to the Australian families who lost loved ones on board the flight,” a statement from the White House said today.

Death toll

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has warned the Australian death toll may still rise as investigators work to uncover the identities of 41 victims of the MH17 disaster who are not yet accounted for.

Speaking on Sky News last night, Ms Bishop also confirmed a 28th Australian death is that of a dual citizen.

The Foreign Minister has issued a stark warning to Russia as it becomes increasingly clear that pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine are responsible for bringing down the jet.

Using language that is more direct than is custom in international relations, Ms Bishop made it clear Australia would use its position on the United Nations Security Council to push for an international investigation and warned Russia not to stand in the way.

“Russia has a crucial role to play in all of this. If, as Russia claims, Ukraine is responsible for this, I expect Russia to support a thorough investigation”, she said.

Ms Bishop’s words were backed by the UN Security Council, which passed a unanimous motion calling for a full and thorough investigation.

“The members of the Security Council called for a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the incident in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines and for appropriate accountability,” the council said in a unanimous declaration.

The UN statement expressed the council’s “deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims, and to the people and governments of all those killed in the crash.”

Council members stood in a moment of silent tribute to the 298 victims at the start of an emergency council meeting. The council called for an investigation “in accordance with international civil aviation guidelines and for appropriate accountability.”

It stressed the need for “immediate access by investigators to the crash site to determine the cause of the incident.”

Ms Bishop also said she had been unable to get in touch with her Russian counterpart, who is on holidays, and was told by the Russians she could not speak to a more junior representative.

The comments came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott earlier condemned the initial response of the Russian Ambassador to the MH17 disaster.

Mr Abbott said it was “highly probable” MH17 was “shot down” by what appeared to be a Russian-backed rebel missile.

Yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister revealed the first response from the Russian Ambassador was to blame Ukraine forces for the tragedy — a response he called “deeply, deeply unsatisfactory”.

The ambassador had been summoned to speak in Sydney with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who was seeking assurances Russia would co-operate with investigators and Australia would get access to the crash site.

Mr Abbott repeated his statement made in Parliament that the disaster was a crime and not an accident.

Australia was working for a binding UN Security Council resolution to secure an independent international investigation, he said.

“It’s very important that we don’t allow Russia to prevent an absolutely comprehensive investigation.”

Mr Abbott said Australia was eager to take a leading role in the investigation, given the high number of Australians killed.

“These people were innocent people going about their lives ... And they have been killed by Russian-backed rebels ... Possibly with Russian supplied missiles.”

He had strong words for those that supplied the rebels with the missile.

“Anyone who gave such a weapon to people who were absolutely incapable of using it ... Should feel a sense of shame.”

He said Russia’s involvement would be a test for that country. “There can be no excuses, no buck passing.”

Mr Abbott said there would be a national day of mourning and ordered flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast tomorrow.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said anyone with concerns for friends or family can call the hotline on 1300 555 135.

THE VICTIMS

Malaysia Airlines says there were 298 people on board, not 295 as originally stated. At least 28 of the victims are Australian.

Among the dead are Victorian couple Albert and Marie Rizk, who are believed to have missed an earlier flight and ended up on MH17.

Mr Rizk, a local real estate agent, and his wife, who have two children, were due to return home from Europe today after spending a month abroad on holidays.

Other victims are 27-year-old Melbourne student Elaine Teoh, Sister Philomene Tiernan — a teacher at eastern Sydney’s Catholic girls’ school — and Perth management consultant Nick Norris, who was travelling with his grandchildren.

Denis Napthine, the Premier of Victoria, said it was likely there were permanent residents of Australia travelling on other passports who were also killed in the crash.

The airline confirmed that those on board included 28 Australians, as well as 154 Dutch, 43 Malaysians, 12 Indonesian (including one infant), nine from the UK, four German, four Beligum, three Filipinos, one Canadian. The nationalities of 41 others on the plane were still unknown.

REACTION

Government minister Ian MacFarlane has played down the possibility that Vladimir Putin could be excluded from the G20 summit in Brisbane in November.

“It’s not a security forum and therefore while we need to be mindful that an investigation does have to take place and we do have to obviously see exactly what’s happened here, in terms of the G20, it is an economic forum not a security forum.”

In the US, Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, and possible presidential candidate, said in a television interview that indications pointed to Russian-backed side and action was needed to “put [Vladimir] Putin on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by”.

“The questions I’d be asking is, number one, who could have shot it down? Who had the equipment? It’s obviously an anti-aircraft missile. Who could have had the expertise to do that? Because commercial airlines are big targets, but by the time they got over that part of Ukraine they should have been high, so it takes some planning [to target such a plane].

“And the Ukrainian government has been quick to blame it on terrorists, which is their name for the Russian insurgents. And there does seem to be some growing awareness that it probably had to be Russian insurgents.”

AIDS CONFERENCE

One of those on board was HIV researcher Joep Lange, who was on his way to Melbourne from the Netherlands to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference, AIDS2014.

As many as 100 of the passengers were thought to be headed to Melbourne for the conference. Organisers have confirmed it will go ahead as planned

“The International AIDS Society (IAS) today expresses its sincere sadness at receiving news that a number of colleagues and friends en route to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference taking place in Melbourne, Australia, were on board the Malaysian Airlines MH17 flight that has crashed over Ukraine earlier today,” a statement from the International AIDS Society said.

“At this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy.”

The event is to be held in Melbourne from July 20-25.

Earlier, Ukraine’s Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko was quoted as saying the plane had been shot down by a ground-to-air missile.

According to CNN senior US officials have concluded the plane was shot down but were divided over the origin.

“One radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down Thursday,” CNN is reporting.

A second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit.

INTERCEPTED PHONE CALLS

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has reportedly released recordings of intercepted phone calls between Russian military intelligence officers and members of terrorist groups that took place about 20 minutes after the crash.

One call was apparently made by Igor Bezler, who the SBU says is a Russian military intelligence officer and leading commander of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.

Igor Bezler: “We have just shot down a plane. Group Minera. It fell down beyond Yenakievo (Donetsk Oblast).”

Vasili Geranin, a colonel in the main intelligence department Russian Federation armed forces then asks: “Pilots. Where are the pilots?”

Bezler replies: “Gone to search for and photograph the plane. Its smoking.”

A second call was between militants nicknamed “Major” and “Greek” about 40 minutes later.

“It’s 100 per cent a passenger (civilian) aircraft,” Major is recorded as admitting that he had seen no weapons on site. “Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medicinal stuff, towels, toilet paper.”

Australian Federal MP Christopher Pyne said there was no doubt that the plane was shot out of the sky. But Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that at this stage it had been unable to verify the cause of the tragedy.

Earlier Mr Gerashchenko told the Wall Street Journal pro-Russia rebels had set up a ground-to-missile battery near the Russian border by the town of Snizhne.

“They clearly thought that it was a military transport plane that they were shooting at,” he said. “They were the ones who did this.”

WHAT HAPPENED?

The plane appeared to have broken up before hitting the ground, and the burning wreckage — which included body parts and the belongings of passengers — was scattered over a wide area.

It came down near the town of Shaktarsk, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, and shocking photos of bodies among the wreckage have been posted on Twitter.

“Malaysia Airlines confirms it received notification from Ukrainian ATC that it had lost contact with flight MH17 at 1415 (GMT) at 30km from Tamak waypoint, approximately 50km from the Russia-Ukraine border,” the carrier said in a statement on Facebook.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the downing an act of terrorism and called for an international investigation into the crash.

Some are blaming Russia for allegedly supporting the separatists but a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said allegations that Russia had been involved in the incident was “stupidity”.

Mr Putin has blamed Ukraine for the crash, “Undoubtedly, the government in whose air space this happened bears responsibility for this terrible tragedy,” a Kremlin statement says.

Putin reportedly opened a meeting with his economic advisers by calling for a moment of silence over the crash.

“This tragedy would not have happened if there were peace on this land, if the military actions had not been renewed in southeast Ukraine. And, certainly, the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy,” he said, according to the statement.

The village of Grabovo is currently under the control of the separatists and the area has seen severe fighting between the two sides in recent days.

SEPARATIST MOVEMENT

Ukraine is a country in crisis. The region where MH17 went down has seen severe fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists in recent days. Ukraine has been in crisis ever since pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office in February by a protest movement among citizens wanting closer ties with the European Union. Russia later annexed the Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine, and pro-Russians separatists in the country’s eastern regions began occupying government buildings and pressing for independence. Moscow denies Western charges it is supporting the separatists or sowing unrest.

SEPARATISTS BLAMED

In a statement, Mr Poroshenko said the plane “disappeared from radar screens”.

“In recent days, this is the third tragic accident after the Russian territory were downed aircraft AN-26 and SU-25 Armed Forces of Ukraine. We do not exclude that this aircraft was also shot down, and stress that the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not commit any action to defeat the purposes of the air,” Mr Poroshenko added.

A defence expert told the BBC that shooting down a plane at that height would have required a long-range surface-to-air missile — possibly guided by radar.

Oleg Tsarev, one of the leaders of the breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, told Time that the rebels did not shoot down the plane.

“We don’t have weapons that can take down a plane from that altitude,” he said, minutes after news of the crash broke.

But there are reports that rebels did have an anti-aircraft military station and the Russian state media even congratulated the rebels on their new Russian-made Buk missile launchers seized from a Ukrainian air force base.

“The Donetsk resistance fighters have captured an anti-aircraft military station,” the Kremlin’s main television network Vesti announced three weeks ago.

Since then there have been regular downings of Ukrainian aircraft including an AN-26 military transport plane, which was shot down on Monday. Its four crew members were taken hostage after they ejected from the aircraft, rebels later confirmed.

According to The Telegraph, the DPR also posted a Twitter picture of a missile system that it captured when it overran a Ukrainian army garrison on June 29.

A spokesman told Voice of Russia radio at the time: “The forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic assumed control of A-1402 (regiment’s) military base” and boasted of capturing the Buk launcher.

A similar weapon was reportedly seen by an Associated Press journalist on Thursday in Snizhne.

As news spread of the crashed Malaysia Airlines flight, the separatists deleted the Twitter photo of the captured missile system.

A raft of global airlines, including Air France, Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa, swiftly responded to the disaster by saying they had been avoiding airspace over eastern Ukraine due to safety concerns.

Qantas has confirmed that it has not flown the route across the Ukraine in recent months because it recognised the risks presented by the separatist conflict, during which the aircraft were being shot down.

They were further advised on Thursday to avoid Ukraine’s airspace

In France, a statement by junior transport minister Frederic Cuvillier said he had advised “French airlines to avoid Ukraine’s air space as long as the reasons behind this catastrophe are not known.”

FLIGHT PATH

Flight MH17 departed Amsterdam at 12:15pm (Amsterdam local time, 8:15pm AEDT) on Thursday and was scheduled to arrive in Kuala Lumpur at 6:10am (Malaysia local time, 8:10am AEDT) the next day.

A Malaysian official tonight told a news conference the flight path was approved by the International Civilian Aviation Organisation and was in unrestricted airspace.

The plane disappeared from radar when flying at 10,000 metres cruising altitude, Interfa-Ukraine reports.

The Daily Beast reported the plane’s “black box” was on its way to Moscow for “investigation”.

But the head of Ukrainian Emergency Situations has since reportedly claimed that search efforts at the scene are being hampered by “armed terrorists”.

In response to the disaster Thai Airways said its flights to Europe have been rerouted to avoid Ukrainian airspace.

The company didn’t say when the route changes were made effective or how many flights were affected.

America’s FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) has also banned US flights from entering the airspace of eastern Ukraine. Via Mashable.

“The FAA has made official what most airlines were already doing: American flights are barred from entering the airspace of eastern Ukraine “until further notice,” the agency says. Flights were already officially barred from Crimea and surrounding areas.”

Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam. The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow. — Malaysia Airlines (@MAS) July 17, 2014

The crash comes just four months after the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which remains missing.

Malaysia’s prime minister Najib Razak said he was “shocked” by the reports. “We are launching an immediate investigation,” he said.

The Kremlin said US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had discussed the crash over the phone.

He said US would offer any assistance it could to determine what happened.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the passengers, wherever they call home.”

A statement from the White House said there needed to be a “full, credible and unimpeded” investigation and urged all concerned — Russia, pro-Russians separatists and the Ukraine — to agree to an immediate ceasefire so investigators could gain access to the crash site.",31242

U.S. envoy to United Nations says pro-Russia rebels likely fired missile at plane

International monitors investigating the Malaysia Airlines crash in eastern Ukraine said Friday the team was not given full access to the site and was greeted with hostility by armed men.

""There didn't seem to be anyone really in control,"" Michael Bociurkiw, spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe team, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

Armed men, apparently pro-Russia militants, loosely guarded the area but couldn't answer the monitors' questions, he said.

Bociurkiw said the group only stayed about 75 minutes and examined about 200 meters at the scene before being forced to leave. Pieces of the airplane and bodies are spread over several kilometers.

The OSCE team arrived at the crash site near Torez in a remote section of eastern Ukraine that's controlled by pro-Russian militants battling the Ukraine government.

The United States says a surface-to-air missile, possibly fired by the militants, took down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on Thursday as the plane traveled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. All 298 people on board died. U.N. Under Secretary General Feltman said 80 of the victims were children.

Lack of access to the crash site worries U.S. officials, including Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, who tweeted: ""Monitors should be able to access the crash site of MH17. US is deeply concerned by reports that separatists are denying access.""

Bociurkiw said the investigation will be difficult because the plane crashed in a difficult-to-access area in the countryside with no electricity.

""I don't think too much of the crime scene has been compromised already,"" Bociurkiw said. ""The bodies are still there. They have not been tampered with. We actually spoke to some civilian emergency workers. They said their job was just to mark where the bodies are.""

The FBI is sending two investigators to work on the case, a U.S. law enforcement official said, but the Ukraine government will be in charge of the investigation.

Obama puts focus on Russia

The location of the flight recorder has not been determined.

Ukrainian Economy and Trade Minister Pavlo Sheremeta told CNN's Richard Quest that MH17's black boxes are in Ukraine. Sheremeta would not say, though, whether the government has them.

""They are on Ukrainian territory. I don't know whether we have it or the international team has it,"" he said.

Earlier Friday, the adviser to the exiled governor of Dontesk told CNN's Victoria Butenko that the black boxes had been retrieved and were in rebel hands, though the location was not clear.

Russia likely bears some of the responsibility for the apparent downing of Flight 17, President Barack Obama said.

In the administration's strongest words yet on the downing of the jet, Obama said rebel fighters couldn't have operated the surface-to-air missile believed responsible for the shootdown ""without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training, and that is coming from Russia.""

In his remarks to reporters, Obama said that he did not want to get ahead of the facts of who may have been directly involved in the airliner's destruction. But he said the United States would work hard to hold accountable those responsible for it.

He and other U.S. officials stopped short of publicly placing the responsibility on Russia, which has denied involvement in the destruction of the jetliner.

But a senior defense official told CNN that the ""working theory"" among U.S. intelligence analysts is that the Russian military supplied the Buk missile system to rebel fighters inside Ukraine.

The United States believes the missile system was transferred into eastern Ukraine from Russia ""in recent days or weeks,"" a senior administration official told CNN, and that the system was operational at the time.

The United States believes pro-Russian separatists could not have operated it without Russian training, the official said, noting that it's unknown whether Russian personnel were on scene when the plane was shot down.

U.S. officials believe the plane was ""likely downed by a surface-to-air missile ... operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine,"" the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council. If pro-Russian separatists are responsible for shooting down the plane with a missile, investigators can't rule out the possibility that Russia offered help to operate the system, she said.

At least one American on board

Obama confirmed that at least one U.S. citizen was aboard the plane; Quinn Lucas Schansman was a student at International Business School Hogeschool van Amsterdam, according to his Facebook page. A majority of the passengers (at least 173) were Dutch.

""No one can deny the truth that is revealed in the awful images that we all have seen, and the eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out,"" Obama said.

He called for an immediate cease-fire in the region and for a ""credible international investigation"" into what happened.

Among the evidence cited by U.S. officials and others for their conclusions was an audio recording released by Ukrainian intelligence officials which purportedly feature pro-Russian rebels and Russian military officers discussing a surface-to-air strike and the crash of a civilian jetliner.

""How are things going there,"" a man identified as a Russian intelligence agent asks.

""Well, we are 100% sure that it was a civilian plane,"" a man identified as a pro-Russian fighter responds.

""Are there a lot of people?"" the Russian officer asks.

The rebel fighter then utters an obscenity and says, ""The debris was falling straight into the yards.""

CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of this audio, or other similar recordings.

Also, in a news conference Friday, the chief of Ukraine's security service, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, said the Buk missile system that shot down the airliner crossed the border from Russia only ""right before"" the attack. He didn't say how investigators know that, however

Ukraine's Interfax news agency reported claims by an adviser to Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Anton Geraschenko that the launcher, as well as the flight data recorders from MH17, were handed over to Russian agents across the border at a checkpoint in the Luhansk area overnight.

A senior Ukrainian official who spoke to CNN also accused Russia of carrying out a cover-up of its role in the shoot-down.

He cited video showing a Buk launcher being moved toward Russia overnight.

CNN could not independently confirm the claims.

Russia-Ukraine dispute

Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian rebels.

Wreckage thought to be from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 lies in Ukraine on Thursday. This image was posted to Twitter.

While Ukrainian officials implicated pro-Russian fighters and their Russian backers for the jetliner's downing, Moscow argued Ukraine was to blame.

""With regard to the claims raised by Kiev, that it was almost us who did it: In fact I haven't heard any truthful statements from Kiev over the past few months,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an exclusive interview with the state-run Russia 24 TV channel.

European Union leaders agreed this week to expand sanctions against individuals and entities in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, with details to be decided by the end of the month. Expanded U.S. sanctions were also announced in Washington.

Airspace closed

The Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure announced Friday that the airspace over Donetsk, Luhansk and part of Kharkiv where rebels are operating had been closed indefinitely.

Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai defended the routing of the Malaysia Airlines plane over the region, saying other carriers were sending their aircraft through the same airspace.

Three months ago, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying in areas some way south of where Flight 17 crashed Thursday. Thursday night, the FAA expanded the flight restrictions to all of eastern Ukraine.

Airline's troubles

Thursday's crash marks the second time this year that Malaysia Airlines has faced an incident involving a downed plane.

In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or its passengers despite extensive search efforts.

Flight 370 probably flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said last month. A new underwater search is expected to begin in August.",28821

Did a Russian fire the missile that downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17? That depends on who you ask.

A top Ukrainian official says he has no doubt.

Vitaly Nayda, Ukraine's director of informational security, told CNN the person who shot down the flight was ""absolutely"" a Russian. ""A Russian-trained, well-equipped, well-educated officer ... pushed that button deliberately,"" he said.

""We taped conversations"" between a Russian officer and his office in Moscow, Nayda said. ""We know for sure that several minutes before the missile was launched, there was a report"" to a Russian officer that the plane was coming, he said.

""They knew the plane was coming with constant speed, in constant direction,"" and should have known it was not a fighter jet but ""a big civilian plane,"" he said.

U.S. officials say pro-Russian rebels were responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, but they now believe it's likely the rebels didn't know the plane was a commercial airliner when they opened fire, U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday.

Moscow has denied claims that it pulled the trigger. And Russian Army Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov suggested a Ukrainian jet fighter may have shot the plane down.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko rejected that in an exclusive interview with CNN, saying that all Ukrainian aircraft were on the ground at the time.

Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, was asked Monday about different intercepted recordings, purportedly of pro-Russian rebels talking about shooting down a plane. Churkin suggested that if they did, it was an accident.

""According to them, the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet,"" he said. ""If they think they shot down a military jet, it was confusion. If it was confusion, it was not an act of terrorism.""

Pro-Russian rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack.

At crash site, an eerie calm

Now that rebels have handed over the black boxes and the bodies of victims killed when Flight 17 went down, the crash site in eastern Ukraine was eerily quiet on Tuesday, a spokesman for observers in the area said.

There were no more local emergency workers or teams combing the wreckage -- even though Dutch officials said they weren't sure whether the remains of all the victims had been recovered.

""They had even taken down the tents,"" said Michael Buciurkiew, spokesman for the monitoring mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ""There was no activity whatsoever. ... We had an internal discussion today on whether to say it's already trending towards a cleanup operation. There's no active recovery of remains going on right now.""

As investigators arrive at the scene, it's unclear what evidence they'll find.

Before activity died down at the site, Buciurkiew said, observers saw emergency workers moving around wreckage.

""Major pieces of the fuselage have been moved,"" he said.

At one point, he said, observers witnessed teams at the scene ""taking out diesel-powered saws and sawing quite invasively into the cockpit.""

Dutch PM: Identifying bodies could take months

A train carrying the remains of crash victims arrived in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday.

Investigators were going through the train cars and transferring bodies to a factory, where a facility was set up to transfer them to coffins and get them on a military plane to the Netherlands for forensic investigation.

But officials offered conflicting reports about how many bodies were on the train, with a top Dutch official expressing concern that the remains of more victims could still be at the crash site.

Malaysian official Mohd Sakri, who traveled on the train with the remains, said there were 282 corpses and 87 body parts aboard -- the same tally Ukrainian officials earlier gave to describe the remains recovered from the crash site.

But Dutch investigators only confirmed there were at least 200 bodies transported from the crash site, Jan Tuinder, head of the Dutch delegation, told reporters. Another Dutch official said investigators were still going through the train cars and it was possible all the crash victims were on the train.

There were 298 people aboard the plane when it crashed.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he expects the first plane carrying the remains to arrive Wednesday in Eindhoven.

As soon as the remains are identified, families of the victims will be informed. In some cases, that could happen quickly, Rutte said, but in other cases, identification could take weeks or even months.

Frans Timmermans, the Dutch foreign minister, said bringing the victims' remains home is his country's top priority.

""To my dying day, I will not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs,"" he told the U.N. Security Council on Monday, ""and that human remains should be used in a political game.""

What's next in the investigation?

Ukrainian rebels handed over the so-called black boxes Tuesday after what Malaysian officials said were repeated attempts to negotiate with the rebels.

""In recent days, we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the MH17 crash site,"" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Monday.

But the handover is only the beginning.

British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that Britain agreed to a Dutch request for accident investigators at Farnborough, southwest of London, to retrieve data from the boxes for international analysis.

And the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said one of its experts will help retrieve information from the black boxes.

The voice recorder could include audio from the cockpit, which would show whether the pilots knew the plane had been hit, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation.

And the flight data recorders will give investigators information about engine settings, pressurization and electronic communications, among other details, she said.

But even the black boxes might not answer the two most pressing questions: who shot down the plane and why.

U.S. and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile in rebel-held territory. Evidence supporting that conclusion includes telephone intercepts and video of a Buk missile launcher traveling into Russia with at least one missile missing.

U.S. President Barack Obama, Cameron and others have said the pro-Russian rebels could not have shot down such a high-flying jet without weapons and training from Russia.

Obama called on Russia to rein in the rebel fighters, who he said had treated remains poorly and removed evidence from the site. ""What exactly are they trying to hide?"" he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that his country would use its influence with Ukrainian rebels to push for a full investigation, the Reuters news agency reported.

But those assurances did little to stem efforts to crack down on the rebels and their supporters.

The European Union's Foreign Affairs Council agreed Tuesday to establish a new list of entitles and individuals, including some from Russia, to face EU sanctions.

Timmermans said the Netherlands would seek sanctions involving various fields, including defense, high technology, the energy sector and financial services.

A brawl broke out Tuesday in Ukraine's parliament, where fighting takes place frequently, as lawmakers voted to increase the number of troops battling pro-Russian rebels.

Nikolai Levchenko, who is from the Donetsk region and has been noticed at separatist rallies, accused the government of killing its own people. A nationalist lawmaker then ran up to him. Soon many lawmakers swarmed around them, with some apparently trying to break up the fight.

Ukraine opens criminal case

The U.S. government has released a map of what it says was the flight's path and the site from which the missile was fired. It also released images that it said showed a weapons buildup at a Russian training facility near the Ukraine border.

As Ukraine ratcheted up accusations that Moscow was involved in downing the plane, it also opened criminal cases against Russia's defense minister and a Russian businessman, calling both ""accomplices of terrorists.""

The Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry accused Russian Defense Minister Gen. Sergei Shoigu of helping form ""illegal military groups"" in the Donetsk region, where pro-Russian rebels have declared their own government.

""The illegal military groups, which are led by citizens of the Russian Federation, make regular attacks on government institutions and other organizations that have led to multiple human deaths, destruction and other consequences,"" the ministry said in a statement.

And the ministry accused Russian billionaire Konstantin Malofeev of financing the ""illegal military units.""

Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in fomenting violence in the region.

A June profile on Malofeev by Bloomberg News noted that the ""self-proclaimed head of the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic and its rebel army leader have both worked for Malofeev, though the financier denies any role in the unrest.""

Earlier this month, Ukraine opened a criminal case against the head of Russia's Border Service.

The ministry's statement Tuesday contained no specific references to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.",27061

Wednesday, Oct. 22 — The stone halls of Parliament Hill echoed with gunfire and were stained with blood Wednesday as a terrorist struck at the heart of the federal government after gunning down a sentry at the National War Memorial.

The gunman was shot and killed near the Library of Parliament, according to Ottawa police sources, by House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former RCMP officer and the man responsible for security on the Hill.

A witness said the gunman, carrying the rifle at his hip, walked deliberately up the west ramp of Centre Block and through the main doors of Parliament as bystanders cowered. It was just before 10 a.m.

The gunman walked right past the Centre Block’s Reading Room — where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with the Conservative caucus — before being confronted and shot.

The dead gunman has been identified as Canadian-born Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, a man who had lived in Aylmer, Montreal and Vancouver, and had a criminal record for relatively minor offences in all cities.

On Wednesday night, there was a report that Canadian police were rounding up ISIL recruits.

The fatal showdown in Centre Block followed the cold-blooded slaying of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old reservist standing guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a short distance from Parliament Hill. The sentries’ rifles are not loaded.

The ceremonial guard at the memorial normally ends on Labour Day but was extended this year because of important anniversaries connected to the First and Second World Wars.

It was the second fatal attack on a Canadian soldier in a week, a shocking turn that has raised questions about whether homegrown radicals are now answering calls for terror attacks in this country.

In a televised address to the nation Wednesday night, Prime Minister Stephen Harper labelled the incidents “despicable attacks” and linked them to international terrorism. “In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,” Harper said. “But this week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.”

He vowed that the nation will not be intimidated, nor will it back down from its commitment to wage war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

“Canada will never be intimidated,” he repeated. “In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts.”

Speaking after Harper, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said the attack was intended to make Canadians “more fearful of their neighbours and less confident in ourselves.”

However, “Today’s events have instead only succeeded in drawing us closer and making us stronger,” he said.

Witnesses said Cpl. Cirillo, a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, based in Hamilton, was shot twice at close range in front of the War Memorial at 9:52 a.m. He was rushed to The Ottawa Hospital’s Civic Campus but did not survive his injuries.

Witnesses said the gunman ran toward Parliament Hill after the shooting; some said he climbed into a parked car on Wellington Street, north of the War Memorial. Others said he commandeered a black Chrysler in front of the East Block and drove it to the base of the Peace Tower.

It remained unclear for most of Wednesday whether Zehaf-Bibeau was acting alone or if other shooters were also involved.

But late in the day, Ottawa police sources told the Citizen that their working theory is that Zehaf-Bibeau was a lone gunman. Police also confirmed that the gunman used a rifle, not a shotgun, in his attack.

Earlier in the day there had been reports of another shooting near the Rideau Centre mall, but those proved to be false.

NDP press secretary Greta Levy said she was about to walk down the stairs beneath the Peace Tower just before 10 a.m. when she saw two women in front of her take cover. Someone — she thinks it was a security guard — yelled, “Get down!” Somebody else shouted, “Gun!” Levy said she went to the ground, then pulled her head up from the crook of her elbow.

“That’s when I saw him walk up the ramp,” she told the Citizen. “As soon as I saw the gun, I put my head back down.”

Zehaf-Bibeau was coming up the west ramp, carrying a rifle at hip level with both hands. He passed right in front of Levy, who had just left the NDP’s caucus meeting. “He was not running,” she said of the gunman, but walking with purpose. He didn’t say a word.

Inside Parliament Hill, Zehaf-Bibeau walked into Centre Block where the NDP and Conservative caucuses had convened for 9:15 a.m. meetings. The Liberal caucus was meeting in the basement.

Harper was with his party’s caucus when the gunman entered the second floor of Centre Block, but was escorted to safety by his RCMP security team.

Across the hall, in the NDP caucus room, about 100 MPs and aides piled tables and chairs in front of the doors after they heard gunshots crash through Centre Block.

“A series of gunshots rang out and we realized they were right on the other side of the door,” NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Citizen.

Parliament Hill security officers rushed politicians out of the building, Liberal MP Marc Garneau among them. “You could smell the gunpowder,” Garneau said.

Security officers pursued the gunman into the Hall of Honour, near the Library of Parliament, and exchanged a hail of gunfire.

Vickers fired the shots that killed Zehaf-Bibeau, according to Ottawa police sources. Another guard was wounded in the confrontation.

A video shot by Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove showed crouching RCMP officers moving through the main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.

“I am safe and profoundly grateful to Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,” Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino said on Twitter.

Justice Minister Peter MacKay offered similar praise: “Thank God for Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our Canadian security forces.”

An injured guard was also taken to The Ottawa Hospital with a non-life threatening leg injury, apparently suffered when he attempted to wrest the rifle from Zehaf-Bibeau. That guard has been identified as Samearn Son, a House of Commons constable, who was unarmed. His colleagues are calling him a hero.

The Ottawa Hospital also treated two other people who suffered minor injuries in the attack. All of the injured were later released from hospital.

The attack is the most serious security breach of Parliament Hill since 1966, when an unhinged man, Paul Chartier, tried to blow up 10 sticks of dynamite on the floor of the House of Commons. He killed only himself when the explosives detonated before he could throw them.

Wednesday’s shooting at the National War Memorial represents the second time this week that a Canadian soldier has come under attack on national soil.

On Monday, 25-year-old Martin Rouleau of Saint-Jean-sur-Richeleau, southeast of Montreal, used his car to ram two Canadian soldiers, one of whom later died of his wounds. Rouleau was a convert to Islam whose online postings had become so radical that the RCMP had confiscated his passport.

There is speculation the attacks are a reaction from homegrown extremists to the federal government’s decision to join the international coalition battling ISIL in the Middle East. Parliament approved a motion to launch a combat mission against ISIL earlier this month.

An ISIL spokesman has called for attacks on Canadians.

Wednesday’s attack began on the grounds of the National War Memorial, a site dedicated to all of those who have fought and died for this country.

Witnesses said the long-haired gunman, dressed in a dark hoodie, blue jeans and wrapped in a scarf, opened fire on one of the two guards. The gunman used a long rifle from close range.

Raivo Nommik, a lighting designer, was walking past the memorial when the shots were fired: “The soldier was shot at close range: It couldn’t have been more than 20 feet.”

Construction worker Matthew Blais was working near the East Block when he heard what he described as a “bunch of pops.”

“I looked over at the War Memorial and I saw a man with a rifle shooting at innocent people,” Blais said. “We ducked for cover.”

Tourist Jan Lugtenborg, of the Netherlands, said he was waiting near the memorial for a tour bus. “Then all of a sudden this happens: I heard four shots. I thought it was a firework,” he said. “We were scared like hell so we ran back.”

Blais said he saw the man jump into a car. “He parked right in front of Parliament and ran into the building,” he said.

The NDP’s Angus described the wild scene inside the party’s caucus room after the first shots were fired on the Hill.

“Security came in fairly fast — I was surprised how fast they came — and I could see from the look in their eyes that they were very worried. We know them. We talk to them every day. They wanted us out of that building.”

Angus found himself with a group of MPs ushered outside through the main doors and then to the Promenade Building on Sparks Street. Others scattered into underground corridors.

“This is a place we feel welcome, secure and natural,” he said. “We didn’t know what else was going on but with police and army rushing past us we realized we were still in the middle of a firefight.”

One woman threw open a second-storey Centre Block window and prepared to jump before construction workers found a ladder and helped her to safety.

Liberal MP John McKay was about to head into the Liberal caucus room on the first floor when he heard popping sounds inside the Parliament buildings.

“I didn’t think anything of it: I thought it was construction,” he said. “And then the security guards come and say, ‘Up! Everybody up! Everybody out!’”

The Liberal MPs were sent out a back door and told to hide behind some statues because security officials were worried that shots could come from Centre Block windows. “We huddled there for a while and then by some means or other we got the all-clear and came down off Parliament Hill,” said McKay.

Police set up roadblocks at all bridges, including the Champlain Bridge to the west of downtown, and checked all cars leaving Ontario.

Meanwhile, helicopters circled downtown and police snipers took up positions on the roof of the National Gallery of Canada.

Security officers told workers in downtown buildings to remain in their offices.

City Hall, the Ottawa courthouse, Lisgar Collegiate and the University of Ottawa were among the many institutions that went into emergency lockdown. The NHL postponed an Ottawa Senators game scheduled for Wednesday night and the National Arts Centre cancelled two performances.

After paralyzing much of downtown Ottawa, the security lockdown that had kept politicians, aides and civil servants confined to their offices was finally lifted at 8:30 p.m.

At an afternoon news conference, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the force’s national division, said security on Parliament Hill had been operating at a “medium” level — the same level that has been in place for years. There was no inkling, he said, that an attack was imminent. “If we had known this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it.”

Ontario’s Minister of Community Safety, Yasir Naqvi, told reporters that he was informed late last week that the federal government was considering an elevation of its national threat level. “I was also informed at the time that there was no specific or imminent threat posed,” the Ottawa Centre MPP said.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asked citizens to think about the slain soldier, Cpl. Cirillo. “Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” he said. “I’m sure I speak for all residents of our city when I extend my heartfelt condolences to the individual who lost his life this morning while standing guard at the National War Memorial in the heart of downtown Ottawa.”

Wednesday’s unprecedented attack on Parliament Hill occurred as Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney was preparing to present new anti-terrorism legislation.

The government intends to amend the CSIS Act in two ways. One measure would let CSIS work more closely with its allies in the “Five Eyes” spy network, which is made up of Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. A second measure would give CSIS informants the same anonymity that already exists for police sources, who are not subject to cross-examination and can have their identities hidden, even from trial judges.

The handful of modern terrorist incidents and major security breaches in Ottawa have largely occurred against foreign embassies and individual diplomats.

There are believed to be more than 200 exterior security cameras monitoring the perimeters of all federal buildings. The Hill is also guarded by vehicular barricades and an undisclosed number of uniformed and plainclothes RCMP officers and Commons and Senate security staff. An RCMP Emergency Response Team is believed to be stationed within striking distance.

Speaker Andrew Scheer said the House of Commons will be sitting Thursday at 10 a.m., as scheduled.

“This sends a clear message of Canada’s resolve to maintain its free and democratic way of life,” he said in a statement.

British Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first world leaders to issue a public statement about Wednesday’s attack.

“I’m appalled by today’s attack in Ottawa,” he wrote on Twitter. “I offer my full support to Prime Minister Harper and the Canadian people as they deal with this incident.”

U.S. President Barack Obama offered his condolences to Cpl. Cirillo’s family and to the Canadian people. “Obviously we’re all shaken by it, but we’re going to do everything we can to make sure we’re standing side by side with Canada during this time,” he said. “Not only is Canada one of our closest allies in the world, but they’re our neighbours and friends.”

U.S. Ambassador Bruce Heyman said he was saddened by news of the attack. “The U.S. government condemns this heinous attack, as well as the attack against the Canadian Forces member killed in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu earlier this week,” he said. “We deplore acts of violence toward military, government and law-enforcement officials and stand ready to assist our Canadian partners as they investigate this event.”

NDP MP Murray Rankin said he expects Parliament Hill will not be as accessible to Canadians in the future in light of Wednesday’s events. “We cannot eliminate risk,” he said. “But we can take prudent steps to minimize the risk. Yes, there will be changes.”

European airspace agency: Ukrainian authorities closed airspace below 32,000 feet

Amid the chaos and the grief, the politics and the finger pointing, we are no closer to answering some key questions about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 . The crash, which killed all 298 people aboard, has turned a volatile Ukrainian region into a global problem.

Here are five questions we don't yet have the answers to.

1. Who shot down the plane?

Only a full investigation can settle that. This much we know: Flight 17 was shot down using a surface-to-air missile in Ukrainian territory that's controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

Ukraine's government says it has ""compelling evidence"" that a Russian-supplied battery, manned by Russian operatives, fired the missile. The United States has also pointed the finger at the Russian-trained rebels.

""We have a video showing a launcher moving back through a particular area there, out into Russia, with at least one missing missile on it,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.

But Russia has denied any involvement. So have the rebels, who accuse the Ukrainians of downing the plane -- without offering proof.

2. Why would anyone target a passenger plane?

If indeed the rebels are behind the attack, they may have mistaken Flight 17 for a Ukrainian military aircraft. In the past few months, the rebels have used surface-to-air missiles to bring down more than a dozen planes, including two transport aircraft, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev said

Shortly after the crash, Igor Strelkov, the self-proclaimed defense minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed on social media that the rebels had shot down a military transport plane. Those posts were later deleted once it turned out the plane was a civilian aircraft.

""It has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain told MSNBC.

3. Why was the plane flying over a war zone?

Most airlines follow rules set by national civil aviation authorities and take the most direct route available, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The Malaysia Airlines flight left Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It flew over eastern Ukraine, which is a common route for international carriers.

Last week, Eurocontrol, the agency responsible for coordinating European airspace, said Ukrainian authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet (about 9,750 meters), but it was open at the level Flight 17 was flying (33,000 feet).

""There's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""Why didn't government officials close off that airspace completely? 32,000 feet, that's a completely arbitrary number.""

4. When will international investigators get access to the crash site?

No one knows.

A U.N. Security Council meeting ended early Monday, with Australia introducing a resolution that called for a swift international investigation.

""There's no doubt that at the moment, the site is under the control of the Russian-backed rebels. And given the almost certain culpability of the Russian-backed rebels in the downing of the aircraft, having those people in control of the site is a little like leaving criminals in control of a crime scene,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday.

But Russia, which has veto power as a permanent member of the council, wants a modified resolution -- one that leaves out Ukraine from any investigation.

5. How will Russia respond?

If an investigation concludes the plane was shot down by rebels using a Russian-supplied missile -- or, worse still, by Russians themselves -- President Vladimir Putin will have two choices. And neither, says professor Daniel Treisman, works to his advantage.

Putin could reject the conclusions and stand by the rebels. If he does so, he risks becoming an international pariah. The West might also hit Russia with even tougher economic sanctions, enough to cripple its economy and send it into a recession.

Or, Putin could sever ties with the rebels. But that could present problems, too.

""A relentless barrage of propaganda has convinced many Russians that their co-ethnics in Donetsk and Luhansk are being massacred by troops commanded by a fascist regime in Kiev,"" said Treisman, who teaches political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, and who authored the book The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev.""

""For Putin to bow to international pressure and abandon his former charges would look like cowardice.""",24135

10:30 p.m. ET: And that's a wrap! Thanks for following along, everybody. Enjoy Sunday’s snowball fights!

10:20 p.m. ET: As we close down the live blog, I wanted to share one final story from earlier this afternoon: Meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Sterling, Virginia (near D.C.'s Dulles airport), like so many other people across the Northeast, were snowed in completely—but they needed to bring in reinforcements for the evening shift. So they did what the rest of us wished we could: They called in the National Guard. Bryan Jackson, one of the meteorologists, described what happened in a media chat: ""With the assistance of the Army National Guard, 3rd and 116th Infantry Divisions, we are able to get staff into and out of the office here in Sterling. We are 100 percent operational.""

10:00 p.m. ET: As this historic snowstorm winds to a close, there's meteorological scandal afoot in the D.C. area. The Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang reports the city's official snowfall observations, taken across the Potomac River by FAA contractors at National Airport, may have been conducted improperly. The issue is that a snow board, which helps provide a more accurate measurement, was not used—even though it is required by NWS guidelines. Jordan Tessler, a D.C.–area meteorologist, conducted a quick analysis arguing that D.C.'s official snow total should be more like 19.5 inches rather than the 17.8 that tentatively was measured. While that may not seem like a huge difference, it would move this storm into third place in D.C. history—up from the current No. 4 ranking. Things like this matter to die-hard weather nerds, and also to the historical record city officials use for planning for future storms. The Weather Channel reports the National Weather Service has ""retracted"" the measurement in question—which will likely be examined by the National Weather Service in more detail, and possibly adjusted.

7:50 p.m. ET: Oh yeah, and it's official now: This is the snowiest day in New York City history.

7:30 p.m. ET: We're closing in on the final hours of the Blizzard of 2016. The latest numbers, as of 7 p.m., along with their new all-time snowstorm rankings: 26 inches in Baltimore (3rd), 25.1 inches at Central Park in NYC (3rd), 20.8 inches in Philadelphia (6th), and 17.8 inches at National Airport in D.C. (exactly tying the 2010 Snowmageddon storm for 4th place)—though there's 28.3 inches at Dulles Airport (2nd all-time) just west of D.C., which might be more representative of the suburbs there.

7:30 p.m. ET: About a half hour away from the evening high tide in New York City, and it doesn't appear that water levels will top Saturday morning's high tide. Great news.

6:50 p.m. ET: A technical discussion from the National Weather Service says that snowfall rates from D.C. to NYC to southern Massachusetts will ""slowly diminish"" through midnight, but isolated bands may continue producing 1 to 2 inches of snow per hour during that time. One such band is currently camped out directly over New York City, where the snow may not totally stop for another 10 hours or so.

6:30 p.m. ET: New York City may be leading when it comes to official snowfall totals, but D.C. may have their northern neighbors beat when it comes to spirit. Take this D.C. police cruiser, for example, that was spotted blasting the soundrack from Frozen to warm the hearts of passersby:

6:00 p.m. ET: This is already, or will very soon become, the biggest one-day snowfall total on record in New York City. Two hours ago, Central Park had 19.3 inches but hasn't reported since (which is normal). As of 6 p.m., JFK airport has recorded a stunning 26 inches—surpassing its single-day record of 21.6 inches set during the Presidents Day storm of February 2003. The snow is falling at an exceedingly heavy two inches per hour rate in the city, and shows no immediate signs of lessening. These records are slightly different than the snowstorm records, which cover a three-day period. NYC's single snowstorm record is 26.9 inches set in February 2010—which this storm is currently on pace to break.

5:40 p.m. ET: For the time being, it looks like New York City has surpassed Washington, D.C.'s snow total—at least according to official measurements. As of 4 p.m., there's 19.3 inches of snow at Central Park in NYC, and at 5 p.m. there was 17.5 inches at National Airport in D.C. NWS forecasters in NYC are expecting another 6 or 7 inches, and D.C. is expecting at least another 2 or 3.

2:45 p.m. ET: As we move past the afternoon low tide, there's fresh concern for afternoon coastal flooding during the next high tide—even in New York City. I've been tweeting with Adam Sobel, the Columbia University professor who literally wrote the book on Sandy's flood, and he's thinking the afternoon high tide may create top-10 all-time coastal water levels in New York Harbor, close to levels reached during Hurricane Irene in 2011. This won't be anywhere close to Sandy levels—that can't be stressed enough—but especially low-lying parts of the city like JFK airport and some sea walls in Manhattan and Brooklyn may be overtopped. During Irene, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg famously closed the entire subway system, the first time that had ever happened. In a post-storm analysis, it was discovered that water levels came within a foot of flooding the subways, which of course actually happened just the next year during Sandy.

2:30 p.m. ET: New York City roads are now completely closed to nonemergency traffic. As the city hunkers down, the snow totals continue to rack up. At 1 p.m., there was 16.5 inches in Newark, N.J., 16.2 inches at LaGuardia Airport in Queens and 14.7 inches in Central Park. Meanwhile, after a midday lull, Washington, D.C.'s official total now stands at 14.9 inches, though nearly twice that has been measured in the surrounding suburbs.

12:50 p.m. ET: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced a travel ban in New York City, effective at 2:30 p.m. Saturday. All city roads will close to civilian traffic, including buses, and elevated subways will close at 4 p.m. as well. All Broadway shows will also be canceled Saturday.

12:45 p.m. ET: One of the oldest cities in America, Lewes, Delaware, recorded its worst coastal flood in history Saturday morning in association with this blizzard. There's a bulletproof direct link to climate change here: Sea levels in Lewes have risen by more than a foot over the last 100 years, meaning this flood would not have been as bad if not for global warming.

11:55 a.m. ET: At a midday press conference, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was considering a total travel ban in response to the recently boosted snowfall forecast. ""Anyone who’s come into the city from the suburbs should turn around and go back. This is very, very fast accumulation, and I guarantee if people linger they will get stuck,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also declared a state of emergency for the region.

11:20 a.m. ET: Just as I posted the update below, the National Weather Service in NYC greatly boosted their snow total forecast. A whopping 24-30 inches is now expected in Central Park, where the city's official snow records are kept. At the top end, that would mean this blizzard would become the single snowiest since those records began, in 1869.

10:55 a.m. ET: This blizzard is just now hitting its stride, the National Weather Service has warned in a technical forecast discussion. They’re calling for a period of up to 2 inch per hour snowfall from D.C. to Baltimore to Philadelphia to NYC to southern Connecticut through midday ""and beyond."" Just across the Hudson River from New York City, parts of New Jersey have already hit the one foot mark, with about 20 hours of snow left to go. This storm may now challenge New York City's biggest single snowfall on record, 26.9 inches in February 2006. In a separate forecast discussion, the NWS in NYC warns that weather models continue to indicate significantly more snow than their relatively conservative forecast (below) shows.

8:20 a.m. ET: A roundup of impacts so far: In Kentucky, the Associated Press reports the Red Cross is providing aid to a group of perhaps ""thousands"" of motorists stranded in a massive 35-mile–long traffic jam on I-75 for as much as 10 hours overnight. The National Guard and Kentucky State Police are working to clear the jam, south of Lexington, one car at a time.

Also, tens of thousands of people are without power in New Jersey, and a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police says officers have responded to 989 crashes and 793 disabled vehicles so far across that state. CNN reports that 11 states have declared a state of emergency.

7:40 a.m. ET: As we reach high tide, it looks like the top-end coastal flooding projections for this storm have unfortunately panned out. In Lewes, Delaware, this storm has now eclipsed the flooding mark set during Hurricane Sandy (8.71 ft)—along with winds gusting above 70 mph. That doesn't mean you have to worry about a Sandy repeat in Northern New Jersey or New York City or Long Island, though, this storm's energy is focused further south where Sandy wasn't ""as bad.""

7:30 a.m. ET: This storm is really hitting its stride in the New York City area, too—and much earlier than expected: There's already six inches on the ground in Central Park as of 7 am, according to official measurements. It'll snow like this for the next 24 hours there.

7:20 a.m. ET: The snow is really starting to pile up in the D.C. area. There's about 12-18 inches on the ground right now, almost half of that just within the last 4 or 5 hours. At National Airport, D.C.'s official snow measuring site, there's 14 inches—good enough for the city's 12th biggest snowstorm in history, and this storm is probably only half over.

7:00 a.m. ET: Thundersnow! Slate's science editor Laura Helmuth has spotted that most joyous of all meteorological phenomena at her home in the D.C. area, and she wasn't the only one. She says: ""We had some tremendous thundersnow this morning at about 6 a.m. in Rockville. Bright flash, extremely long-lasting thunder peal."" Awww, yeah. There's some real science at work here too: Thundersnow is an indicator of extremely heavy snowfall rates.

11:30 p.m. ET: Overnight weather models are in, and once again, they're showing the storm pushing further north than previously expected. This trend, as well as the storm's stronger-than-expected showing so far—parts of the D.C. area already have 10 inches!—have prompted the NWS forecasters in New York City to go all in.

Here's what I'm thinking for the rest of the storm: For D.C., an additional 15-20 inches—which would challenge the city's all-time snowfall record. This is a crippling amount of snow, and it will probably take days for the city to get moving again. Baltimore and Philadelphia should also wind up with a 20-25 inch storm total. New York City, which was expecting just 5-10 inches this morning, should now prepare for 18-24, ranking among the city's five worst snowstorms since the Civil War. Saturday from 8 a.m. to midnight will be the storm's peak, with heaviest snowfall rates, strongest winds (with gusts up to 50 mph), and most blizzard-y conditions. Don't be afraid to ask your neighbors for help if you're caught off-guard by the sudden boost in the forecast. In my six years in New York City, big snowstorms were an amazing, magical time. Enjoy it, and stay safe.

9:00 p.m. ET: This blizzard, whatever you want to call it—#Blizzard2016, #Snowzilla, or #DavidSnowie—is still about a day or so away from peak strength. It's been wow'ing meteorologists for days via computer model projections, and now it's wow'ing them with spectacular satellite images like the one below.

8:10 p.m. ET: This week, Slate collected some fabulous reader questions about the impending megablizzard. While we have a few minutes, I wanted to share my favorite that was left on the editor's chopping block: Just how big of a snowball fight could we have with the snow this thing is going to dump on the east coasters? Is there enough for everyone in the country to have say, 10 snowballs, which would probably be the minimum acceptable level for a true fight?

Here's my answer: Let’s see, there are 320 million people in the USA, and the snow will fall over about 100,000 square miles at an average depth of, let’s say, 10 inches. There are about 4 billion square inches in a square mile, which means the total amount of snow will be about 4 quadrillion cubic inches of snow. That means each American gets about 12,000,000 cubic inches of snow, enough for about 7,000 snowballs for every man, woman, and child in the country. This doesn’t factor in the inevitable melt during the transportation and distribution process, so you’re on your own to figure out how that part’s going to work. But basically, yes.

7:30 p.m. ET: Snow has been falling for about eight hours in D.C. now, and streets are beginning to resemble winter wonderlands. The National Weather Service says snow should fall at up to one inch per hour during the evening hours before picking up overnight.

7:30 p.m. ET: The Associated Press is reporting that at least eight people have died in weather-related incidents so far in the blizzard in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

7:10 p.m. ET: While folks in Washington, D.C. and points northward anticipate the Big One, meteorological fireworks are already flying down in Charlotte, N.C. where a major ice storm is underway. Power outages are already piling up across the Carolinas, and the video below is a great example of why.

6:40 p.m. ET: While the storm gathers steam and heavier snow begins to spread northward, some have found solace in the live video feed of snow piling up on the National Mall from Paul Ryan's office in the U.S. Capitol. The music—and the comments section—are definitely worth the trip. Update, 7:00 p.m.: GQ Magazine calls Ryan's choice of music a ""gorgeous piece of tropical sex jam perfection.""

5:20 p.m. ET: If, like me, you're weirdly obsessed—already!!—with checking how much snow is piling up in your neighborhood and are too lazy/cold to go outside and check the sidewalk yourself, the National Weather Service will be issuing reports about once every two hours throughout the duration of the storm compiling reports from people that are brave enough to take their own measurements. Here's the links for D.C./Baltimore, Philly, and NYC. Also, if that's not enough of a guilt trip, here's the proper way of measuring snow if you'd like to do a science and help out forecasters during this historic snowstorm.

4:30 p.m. ET: Light snow has been falling for a few hours now in Washington, D.C., where the heaviest totals of this storm are expected—but meteorologists a bit further north are beginning to get a little nervous. Today's last-minute weather models threw fresh uncertainty on just how far north the sharp cut-off of multi-foot snow totals might reach, and National Weather Service forecasters in Philadelphia and New York City have significantly boosted their snow projections in response. There's now likely to be 20 inches of snow in Philly, up from a range of 12-18 just this morning.

Hostages at kosher grocery store

At the same time, in a different setting near Paris's Porte de Vincennes about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, a similar crisis played out at a kosher store.

Amedy Coulibaly -- the same man who, authorities said, is suspected with Hayat Boumeddiene of killing a policewoman Thursday south of Paris -- on Friday took a number of hostages there. Boumeddiene remains at large.

Like Cherif Kouachi, a man claiming to be Coulibaly called BFMTV on Friday. At the scene, witnesses heard Coulibaly demand freedom for the Kouachi brothers, according to police union spokesman Pascal Disand.

Law enforcement swarmed the area. Dozens of schools went on lockdown.

A resolution came a few minutes after the Dammartin-en-Goele climax, in the form of explosions and gunfire. Up to 20 heavily armed police officers moved into the store. They came out with a number of civilians.

Not everyone made it. Hollande said four people were killed. Israeli government sources told CNN that Hollande told Netanyahu that four hostages were killed and 15 were rescued. Molins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market.

Father: 'It's like a war'

In a speech Friday night, Hollande called the Porte de Vincennes deaths an ""anti-Semitic"" act.

He urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against Muslims, saying, ""Those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the Muslim religion.""

""Unity"" he said, ""is our best weapon.""

Map: Standoffs near Paris, France

That kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days.

It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son.

And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety.

""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son.""

Parts of France on high alert

This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else.

They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them. The dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names: Cabu, Wolinski, Honore and Tignous.

Authorities followed a lead Thursday morning from a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Dammartin-en-Goele, whom Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas. Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods.

Ties to Islamist extremists

As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still.

Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers.

Both men had ties to Islamist extremists.

Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack.

Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials.

His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans.""

""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis.""

Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN.

A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording.

Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike.

Cherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter.

The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together.

Charlie Hebdo attackers holed up in print shop

The day's drama began in Dammartin-en-Goele, where brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi ended up in a print shop in an industrial area.

A salesman, who identified himself only as Didier, told France Info radio that he shook one of the gunman's hands at about 8:30 a.m. as they arrived at the business. Didier said he first thought the man, who was dressed in black and heavily armed, was a police officer.

As he left, the armed man said, ""Go, we don't kill civilians."" Didier said, ""It wasn't normal. I did not know what was going on.""

The gunmen told police that they wanted to die as martyrs, Yves Albarello, who is in France's Parliament, said on channel iTele. The area, meanwhile, was locked down -- with children stuck in schools, roads closed and shops shuttered.

Shortly before 5 p.m., gunshots and at least three large explosions pierced the relative silence. .

Soon after, men could be seen on the roof of the building where the brothers had holed up. Four helicopters landed nearby.

Word came that the brothers were dead and that a man who had been hiding in the building was safe, said Bernard Corneille, the mayor of nearby Othis.

Hostages at kosher grocery store

At the same time, in a different setting near Paris's Porte de Vincennes about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, a similar crisis played out at a kosher store.

Amedy Coulibaly -- the same man who, authorities said, is suspected with Hayat Boumeddiene of killing a policewoman Thursday south of Paris -- on Friday took a number of hostages there. Boumeddiene remains at large.

Like Cherif Kouachi, a man claiming to be Coulibaly called BFMTV on Friday. At the scene, witnesses heard Coulibaly demand freedom for the Kouachi brothers, according to police union spokesman Pascal Disand.

Law enforcement swarmed the area. Dozens of schools went on lockdown.

A resolution came a few minutes after the Dammartin-en-Goele climax, in the form of explosions and gunfire. Up to 20 heavily armed police officers moved into the store. They came out with a number of civilians.

Not everyone made it. Hollande said four people were killed. Israeli government sources told CNN that Hollande told Netanyahu that four hostages were killed and 15 were rescued. Molins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market.

Father: 'It's like a war'

In a speech Friday night, Hollande called the Porte de Vincennes deaths an ""anti-Semitic"" act.

He urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against Muslims, saying, ""Those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the Muslim religion.""

""Unity"" he said, ""is our best weapon.""

Map: Standoffs near Paris, France

That kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days.

It's something that a man, who asked to be called simply Teddy, understands. He was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday, hoping to pick up his young son.

And, eventually, the students did leave the school -- accompanied by police officers who held their hands and, in some cases, lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety.

""It's like a war,"" Teddy said. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son.""

Parts of France on high alert

This ""war"" erupted two days ago, when a pair of heavily armed men -- hooded and dressed in black -- entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine known for its provocative, often profane, take on religion, politics and most anything else.

They burst into a meeting, called out individuals, and then executed them. The dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names: Cabu, Wolinski, Honore and Tignous.

Authorities followed a lead Thursday morning from a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Dammartin-en-Goele, whom Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas. Police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods.

Ties to Islamist extremists

As the suspects moved, the French government -- including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country -- also didn't stand still.

Some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed, which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Investigators also dug to learn about the attackers.

Both men had ties to Islamist extremists.

Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack.

Said, the elder of the Kouachi brothers, spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to U.S. officials.

His younger brother, Cherif, has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism, according to documents obtained by CNN. In a 400-page court record, he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria ""to go and combat the Americans.""

""I was ready to go and die in battle,"" he said in a deposition. ""... I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television. ... I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis.""

Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly, a Western intelligence source told CNN.

A man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the recording.

Al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike.

Cherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing. Coulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal, a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda's premier European recruiter.

The Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene, his alleged accomplice in the police shooting, and that the two traveled to Malaysia together.

A unity rally will be held Sunday ""celebrating the values behind"" Charlie Hebdo, said British Prime Minister David Cameron, who will travel to Paris to attend.

And the magazine itself -- whose former offices were firebombed in 2011, on the day it was to publish an issue poking fun at Islamic law and after it published a cartoon of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed -- will go on as well, even without its leader and most talented staffers. It's set to publish thousands of copies of its latest edition next Wednesday.

Both players were convicted of sexual assault. Warning: Graphic content (13:18)

During the first rape, Tanya was shoved into the muddy ground before her pants were pulled down. After it was over, the Baylor football player allowed her to get up and walk away, but then he pushed her, face forward, into a metal fence and raped her again.

He disappeared after handing Tanya her shirt back. Dazed, Tanya made her way back into the party, found her friends, and told one of them, ""I think I was just raped.""

Once at the hospital, in Waco, Texas, Tanya recounted for Waco police and a nurse what had happened: A Baylor University football player named Tevin Elliott had raped her. The defensive end would end up arrested by Waco police, charged with sexually assaulting Tanya, kicked off the football team and expelled.

Days later, Tanya said she went to Baylor's campus police department, asking officers if there was anything they could do for her, because she'd been assaulted by a fellow student. She didn't ask for anything specific, but she thought maybe a campus escort or security could be provided, because Elliott remained in Waco.

There is nothing we can do, because the assault happened off campus.

A few days later, she said she contacted Baylor's student health center, seeking counseling.

There is no one who can see you now. You could, though, put your name on a waiting list. Maybe you should see someone off campus.

With final exams coming up and Tanya's schoolwork already beginning to suffer, her mother called Baylor's academic services group for assistance.

Sorry. No resources are available. Even ""if a plane falls on your daughter, there's nothing we can do to help you.""

Tanya, a Baylor freshman at the time, was one of five women who reported to police that they were either raped or assaulted -- in incidents from October 2009 to April 2012 -- by Elliott, who was convicted on two counts of sexual assault in January 2014 for the incident involving Tanya.

Baylor University took nearly three years to comply with a federal directive to hire a Title IX coordinator. ESPN

Despite being a private school, Baylor is required by federal law -- Title IX -- to thoroughly investigate allegations of sexual violence, and provide security, counseling services and academic help to those who report assaults. Part of the law's goal is to help keep victims in school.

Yet an investigation by Outside the Lines found several examples in Tanya's case, and others at Baylor, in which school officials either failed to investigate, or adequately investigate, allegations of sexual violence. In many cases, officials did not provide support to those who reported assaults. Moreover, it took Baylor more than three years to comply with a federal directive: In April 2011, the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to all colleges and universities outlining their responsibilities under Title IX, including the need for each school to have a Title IX coordinator. Baylor didn't hire a full-time coordinator until fall 2014.

""They didn't just not respond; they responded by turning me away and telling me that it was not possible for me to receive help from them,"" said Tanya, whose identity is being kept private by Outside the Lines because she was the victim of a sexual assault.

Tanya's story is similar to others at Baylor and an array of universities nationwide; the U.S. Department of Education is investigating complaints against 161 institutions for their handling of sexual violence investigations. In a more recent Baylor case, university officials agreed to a monetary settlement with another victim of a football player's assault. Defensive end Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of sexual assault in August after a Baylor soccer player reported to Waco police that he'd assaulted her in October 2013. During Ukwuachu's trial, it was disclosed that Baylor officials had conducted an internal investigation into the assault complaint and cleared him of any wrongdoing.

""I wouldn't call it an investigation,"" said McLennan County Assistant District Attorney Hilary LaBorde, who prosecuted the Elliott and Ukwuachu cases in court. ""They didn't have someone that seemed to know anything about how college rape occurs.""

Baylor, which is not among the schools being federally investigated, declined to make any coaches -- including head football coach Art Briles -- or administrators available for interviews with Outside the Lines. One of those administrators was university president Ken Starr, the former judge and independent counsel who led the investigation into President Bill Clinton's intern-sex scandal.

Baylor police also refused to release any records pertaining to the incidents, even though the Texas legislature passed a law last summer making private campus police departments subject to state open records laws. A spokeswoman for the school said she could not provide information about any of the assaults due to student privacy, even though the two women featured in this story signed release forms allowing Baylor officials to discuss their cases with Outside the Lines.

Patty Crawford, the university's new Title IX coordinator, spoke to Outside the Lines but said she could not specifically address past incidents. She said the school has hired an outside consultant to review its handling of previous cases, although she said she didn't know whether the school would make that report public.

""We do want to be our best, and we're always wanting to be an improvement from yesterday,"" she said.

On April 1, 2012, two weeks before Tanya filed her police report against Elliott, another woman reported to Waco police that Elliott had forced her to have sex with him.

A few weeks later, the woman -- Kim -- and her mother said they also reported the assault to Baylor's ombudsman office and were sent to meet with the school's chief judicial officer, Bethany McCraw.

Both women said McCraw's response noted that Kim, also a Baylor athlete, was the sixth woman to report such an incident involving Elliott.

""I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, six?' "" Kim said. ""We essentially asked, 'Well, why are there six?' and, 'Well, does the football team know about this? Does Art Briles know about this?' And she said, 'Yes, they know about it, but it turns into a he said-she said, so there's got to be, actually a court decision in order to act on it in any sort of way.' ""

But that contradicts the directive issued in the 2011 letter from the U.S. Department of Education -- one that McCraw would testify in court that she received -- that states a criminal investigation ""does not relieve the school of its duty under Title IX to resolve complaints promptly and equitably.""

Kim said she asked about a restraining order. She said McCraw told her it would essentially simply consist of a letter sent to Elliott telling him to not come near her, ""and then you kind of hope for the best.""

Kim said she believed McCraw was trying to talk her out of pursuing anything against Elliott.

McCraw was helpful in one area, though, Kim said: She said she told McCraw she was having trouble preparing for her final exams, and McCraw offered to contact her professors to give her dispensation. Kim said she suspected that occurred only because she was so close to getting her degree.

""And she was like, 'OK, well, we'll make that happen.' Like 'Shoo, shoo, run along. OK, got it. Let's just get her graduated,' you know?"" she said.

When contacted by Outside the Lines, McCraw said Kim's account was inaccurate, but she declined to comment further.

Although Kim testified during Elliott's trial, the football player was not charged in connection with her assault, in part because prosecutors decided her case wasn't as strong as others; Elliott would end up accused of one assault and four rapes, facing formal charges on two of them, including one against a former member of Baylor's equestrian team. Two of the students who accused him did not attend Baylor.

Kim, who is not being identified because she is an alleged sexual assault victim, said Baylor University provided her little assistance after she reported her assault. ESPN

Michele Davis, a former member of a Baylor advisory board that reviewed sexual assault-response issues with community leaders, told Outside the Lines university officials have known for at least a few years of a much larger problem with sexual assaults and athletes.

Davis is also the sexual assault nurse examiner for McLennan County, which means she is often the first person who interviews women who come to local hospitals reporting they've been raped.

""Baylor has more sexual assault cases -- that we do exams on -- compared to the other schools with the same approximate population,"" she said, in reference to two other colleges in Waco. She said she sees about eight Baylor students a year, and of those, she said Baylor athletes make up between 25 percent to 50 percent of the alleged perpetrators. (Male athletes are 4 percent of the undergraduate male population at Baylor.) Most women refuse to report such incidents to authorities, she said.

She said Baylor's advisory board was aware of the problem with athletes and recommended that someone from the athletic department join the board, but she said that did not happen during her term, which ended in 2014. Crawford put the board on hiatus as she rebuilt the university's Title IX office but said she plans to restart it.

Within weeks of Tanya's and Kim's reports being filed with Waco police, Briles suspended Elliott. His arrest for assaulting Tanya marked the first time media picked up on any of the accusations against him.

Baylor was coming off its most successful football season in decades. In 2011, it had finished in the top-25 polls for the first time since the mid-1980s. Quarterback Robert Griffin III had won the Heisman Trophy, a first for any Baylor football player.

Baylor officials declined to answer questions about when they knew of Elliott's alleged assaults, but a source told Outside the Lines that records show Baylor judicial affairs officials were aware of a misdemeanor, sexually-related assault citation against Elliott in November 2011. In that incident, a local community college student told police that Elliott trapped her in her room, held her against her will and touched her inappropriately, at one point poking a broom toward her vagina.

Elliott played nine of 13 games that season. Outside the Lines spoke to Elliott, who is serving a 20-year sentence at a prison in West Texas, and he said that none of his coaches mentioned the incident to him, and he received no punishment.

""I don't even know if they knew,"" he said. ""I just kept playing ball, kept going to school.""

Elliott denied all of the assaults, saying that any sex he had with the women was consensual.

""You know college athletes go through this all the time. ... At the end of the day, the finger is going to be pointed at us because we are the big athletes,"" he said. ""We're sitting on a pedestal, they trying to make us look bad, but at the end of the day, we could be innocent. It's like we are guilty until proven innocent.""

Elliott and his family are trying to mount an appeal, alleging that apartment security video that could clear him of Tanya's rape is mysteriously missing and that jurors ignored evidence.

McLane Stadium, home to the Baylor football team. ESPN

In October 2013 -- while Elliott's case was progressing toward trial -- a Baylor soccer player accused football player Sam Ukwuachu of rape. Ukwuachu, also a defensive end, wasn't indicted until June 2014.

His case remained under wraps, and out of the media, for more than year until it went to trial last August. During that time, Ukwuachu did not play, but he remained on the team and enrolled in school.

Kim said she heard about the trial on the news.

""And I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' It's like they didn't take the Tevin thing seriously. What, did we not cry out enough for something to be done? I mean, was that not enough for you to listen to us?""

In the Ukwuachu case, the university had actually conducted a Title IX investigation. It cleared him. Two months before Ukwuachu's trial, the football team's defensive coordinator, Phil Bennett, told a crowd at a luncheon that he expected Ukwuachu to play in the 2015 season.

Ukwuachu, through his attorney, declined a request for an interview with Outside the Lines. He issued a lengthy statement in which he said he was falsely accused and that he did not receive a fair trial. He said his accuser lied repeatedly about what had happened, and prosecutors presented false evidence during his trial.

""Do not criticize Baylor University or my former coaches,"" he wrote. ""A Baylor University investigation cleared me and allowed me to graduate because they caught my accuser in multiple lies pertaining to the events that happened the night of the alleged incident as well as our previous encounter during their investigation.""

LaBorde, the McLennan County assistant district attorney, said Baylor's investigation -- which was not provided to Outside the Lines -- faulted the soccer player for having been friends with Ukwuachu and having twice gone over to his apartment before the night on which she reported the rape.

""I have no explanation for [Baylor's lack of action] other than it's just some 1940s mentality of how women should behave,"" she said. ""If they're sitting around and waiting for a victim who has been pulled off the jogging path and raped by a stranger wearing a trench coat, they're going to be waiting for a long time.""

She said Baylor officials didn't request certain records or interview sources who might have provided better evidence.

Crawford, the school's Title IX coordinator, said she couldn't talk about the Ukwuachu investigation.

""I can't speculate from the past. I wasn't in the room. I wasn't there. I do know that, in the world of Title IX ... we don't have certain powers that criminal process and a justice process has,"" she said.

Ukwuachu's accuser was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the encounter. She had been struggling to recover from a knee injury suffered while playing soccer when Baylor reduced her athletic scholarship. She ultimately transferred to another university.

""She's the one that has to leave, and he remains,"" LaBorde said. ""Somehow they have the money to keep him, even though he's under indictment. They don't have the money to keep her.""

Crawford said the school has since taken steps to make sure students get the help they need -- regardless of the outcome of any judicial hearing.

""Any time a man or woman comes forward and says, 'Hey, this has happened to me,' we create a plan together. And I say, 'I'm going to navigate the resources. What do you need?' "" she said. ""We don't want them to have to tell 10 people that maybe they were sexually assaulted. That just can retrigger a trauma and can cause a lot of problems, especially during exams or any time during an academic career.""

She said more than 6,000 faculty, staff, residence hall leaders and athletes have been trained, and Baylor has Title IX ""case managers"" who work comprehensively with each student.

""The real essence of Title IX is student success. And it's hard to be successful when you don't feel safe,"" Crawford said.

Crawford described having overhauled the Title IX system to get all departments, including athletics, involved in preventing and addressing sexual assault allegations so everyone will know what to do if they're made aware of an incident of sexual violence.

Tanya said she and her mother had never heard of Title IX until they were contacted by Outside the Lines for this story. They declined to say whether they were considering legal action against Baylor.

""Everybody knew what was going on, but nobody helped us,"" Tanya's mother said. ""No one reached out to us, not a phone call, not a letter, nothing.""

She said she has heard the university's pledge to do better, but she doesn't buy it.

""Their football team is their priority.The money that comes to them is their priority,"" she said. ""You cannot serve two masters. Theirs is money. They don't care about their students. They don't care about the victims.""

Her daughter has a similar, cynical view.

""Do I think the administration is sincere? No. Because then they would have acted differently in Sam's [Ukwuachu's] case,"" she said. ""I don't think that they are sincere.""

Tanya stayed at Baylor one year after her rape, but she said she wasn't able to focus on her work, and her grades plummeted. She lost her academic scholarship and was put on academic probation.

In spring 2013, Tanya's mother said she called academic services one last time. She told them what happened to her daughter and asked for help. She said she was given exit forms for Tanya to sign.

Tanya dropped out of Baylor, moved home, gave up her dream of becoming a nurse and enrolled in a local community college.

""Baylor has deceived people like me and like other victims of assault because they told us that they would represent something good and something righteous,"" Tanya said. ""And in every way, they have failed to do so.""

Inside the biggest change in barbie’s 57-year history–and what it says about American beauty ideals

Part 1

Barbie’s dress won’t fit.

Photograph by Kenji Aoki for TIME

I’m sitting in a bright pink room at Mattel’s headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., playing with a Barbie that only 20 people in the world know exists. Her creation has been kept so secret that the designers code-named the endeavor Project Dawn so that even their spouses wouldn’t be tipped off to her existence.

Like every girl who has ever played with the most popular toy in history, I yank her clothes off and try to put on a new dress. It’s a blue summery frock, cinched tightly at the waist with a black ribbon. I try to tug it over her head, but the waistline gets stuck at her shoulders, her blond mane peeking out from the neckline. “Try going feet first,” the lead designer suggests, and I do. No good. Her plump bottom gets stuck in the same spot. Yes, plump. Barbie’s got a new body. Three new bodies, actually: petite, tall and curvy, in Mattel’s exhaustively debated lexicon, and beginning Jan. 28 they will be sold alongside the original busty, thin-waisted form on Barbie.com. They’ll all be called Barbie, but it’s the curvy one—with meat on her thighs and a protruding tummy and behind—that marks the most startling change to the most infamous body in the world.

It’s a massive risk for Mattel. Barbie is more than just a doll. The brand does $1 billion in sales across more than 150 countries annually, and 92% of American girls ages 3 to 12 have owned a Barbie, thanks in part to her affordable $10 price tag. She’s been the global symbol of a certain kind of American beauty for generations, with brand recognition that’s up there with Mickey Mouse. M.G. Lord, a Barbie biographer, once said she was designed “to teach women what—for better or worse—is expected of them in society.”

The company hopes that the new dolls, with their diverse body types, along with the new skin tones and hair textures introduced last year, will more closely reflect their young owners’ world. But the initiative could also backfire—if it’s not too late altogether. Adding three new body types now is sure to irritate someone: just picking out the terms petite, tall and curvy, and translating them into dozens of languages without causing offense, took months. And like me, girls will strip curvy Barbie and try to put original Barbie’s clothes on her or swap the skirts of petite and tall. Not everything will Velcro shut. Fits will be thrown, exasperated moms will call Mattel. The company is setting up a separate help line just to deal with Project Dawn complaints.

But staying the course was not an option. Barbie sales plummeted 20% from 2012 to 2014 and continued to fall last year. A line of toys designed to teach girls to build, Lego Friends, helped boost Lego above Mattel as the biggest toy company in the world in 2014. Then Hasbro won the Disney Princess business away from Mattel, just as Elsa from the film Frozen dethroned Barbie as the most popular girl’s toy. The estimated revenue loss to Mattel from Elsa and the other Disney Princesses is $500 million.

Meanwhile, American beauty ideals have evolved: the curvaceous bodies of Kim Kardashian West, Beyoncé and Christina Hendricks have become iconic, while millennial feminist leaders like Lena Dunham are deliberately baring their un-Barbie-like figures onscreen, fueling a movement that promotes body acceptance. In this environment, a new generation of mothers favor what they perceive as more empowering toys for their daughters. Elsa might be just as blond and waif-thin as Barbie, but she comes with a backstory of strength and sisterhood. “The millennial mom is a small part of our consumer base,” concedes Evelyn Mazzocco, head of the Barbie brand, “but we recognize she’s the future.”

Part 2

The board behind Mazzocco’s desk is filled with words like out of touch, materialistic, not diverse.

She tacked them up shortly after she took over Barbie in 2014, part of a massive shake-up at Mattel during which president and COO Richard Dickson put people with creative backgrounds at the head of several brands, hoping they would come up with more-innovative solutions to Mattel’s sinking sales. The first thing Mazzocco did in that role was survey Barbie’s haters.

“I wanted to remind myself every time I came to work about the reality of what is going on with the brand,” says Mazzocco, who has three daughters whom she uses as her “own little focus group.” Not that she needed the reminder: she routinely receives hate mail and even death threats over Barbie’s body.

Barbie has courted controversy since her birth. Her creator, Ruth Handler, based Barbie’s body on a German doll called Lilli, a prostitute gag gift handed out at bachelor parties. Her proportions were designed accordingly. When Handler introduced Barbie (named after her daughter Barbara) in 1959 at the New York Toy Fair, her male competitors laughed her out of the room: nobody, they insisted, would want to play with a doll with breasts.

Still, Barbie’s sales took off, but by 1963 women were protesting the same body men had ridiculed. That year, a teen Barbie was sold with a diet book that recommended simply, “Don’t eat.” When a Barbie with pre-programmed phrases uttered, “Math class is tough,” a group called the Barbie Liberation Organization said the doll taught girls that it was more important to be pretty than smart. They switched out Barbie’s voice box with that of GI Joe so that the blonde cried, “Vengeance is mine,” while the macho warrior enthused, “Let’s plan our dream wedding.”

Mattel argues that the criticism was misplaced—that Barbie was a businesswoman in 1963, an astronaut in 1965 and a surgeon in 1973 when 9% of all doctors were women. “Our brand represents female empowerment,” argues Dickson. “It’s about choices. Barbie had careers at a time when women were restricted to being just housewives. Ironically, our critics are the very people who should embrace us.”

Mattel has also long claimed that Barbie has no influence on girls’ body image, pointing to whisper-thin models and even moms as the source of the dissatisfaction that too many young girls feel about their bodies. A handful of studies, however, suggest that Barbie does have at least some influence on what girls see as the ideal body. The most compelling, a 2006 study published in the journal Developmental Psychology, found that girls exposed to Barbie at a young age expressed greater concern with being thin, compared with those exposed to other dolls.

But it was only when moms started voting with their dollars that Mattel had to reassess these criticisms. In the mid-2000s Barbie faced her first serious competition after years of maintaining about 90% market share of the doll sector. Bratz, the edgy, bug-eyed dolls with their own smartphones and lip gloss, were “eating Barbie’s lunch in the older-girl demographic, and Disney Princess was chomping away at the younger-girl demographic,” explains Dickson. “Barbie was having an identity crisis.”

At first, this wasn’t a major problem for Mattel. Dickson was brought in in 2000 to expand the Barbie brand from dolls to apparel, TV shows and gaming. That’s when Barbie got her own interactive website. (She also has her own show that streams on Netflix.) The Barbie brand’s sales went up even as the doll’s sales sank. And Mattel as a whole prospered. The company was producing the Disney Princess dolls through a licensing deal, and to combat the Bratz problem, it created its own line of cutting-edge dolls, Monster High.

But in 2012, Barbie global sales dropped 3%. They dropped another 6% in 2013 and 16% in 2014. And the dominance of Frozen’s Elsa signals more trouble ahead. Even two years after the film’s release, the allure of Frozen hasn’t abated. At a Los Angeles Target, I locate Barbie in the toy aisle, beaming down at me from her dream house (pink convertible sold separately). On the next shelf over sits Elsa in a box that invites you to press a button to hear her sing. I press. As the doll begins to belt out the girl-power anthem “Let It Go,” children—girls and boys—come running from all directions screaming, dancing, one explaining to her mom why they need yet another variation of the Elsa doll in their house. I make a hasty retreat as the mother begins to look around for the idiot who started playing “Let It Go” in the toy aisle during the holiday season.

Therein lies Barbie’s problem. As much as Mattel has tried to market her as a feminist, Barbie’s famous figure has always overshadowed her business outfits. At her core, she’s just a body, not a character, a canvas upon which society can project its anxieties about body image. “Barbie has all this baggage,” says Jess Weiner, a branding expert and consultant who has worked with Dove, Disney and Mattel to create empowering messaging for girls. “Her status as an empowered woman has been lost.”

Part 3

With all that in mind, Kim Culmone, head of design, posed a challenge to her team:

If you could design Barbie today, how would you make her a reflection of the times? Out of that came changing Barbie’s face to have less makeup and look younger, giving her articulated ankles so she could wear flats as well as heels, giving her new skin tones to add diversity and then of course changing the body. While curvy Barbie’s hips, thighs and calves are visibly larger than before, from the waist up she is less Jessica Rabbit than she is pear-shaped. Mattel refuses to discuss the actual proportions of the new dolls or how it came to decide on them.

What’s clear in listening to the team discuss the project is that every step was taken on tiptoe. “It’s a personal issue because almost every woman has owned a Barbie, and every woman has some relationship with or opinion about Barbie,” says Culmone. During one meeting, designers, marketers and researchers fixated on the shoe problem. There will now be two Barbie shoe sizes, one for curvy and tall and another for original and petite. “We can’t label them 1, 2, because someone will read into that as saying one’s better than the other,” Barbie designer and former Project Runway contestant Robert Best explains. “Plus, we have to put the Barbie branding on every single object, and the shoes are so tiny.” They finally land on a B for one shoe size and Barbie’s face on the other. Moms will have to puzzle out which is which when they find a miniature stiletto jammed between their couch cushions.

Indeed, the additional bodies are a logistical nightmare. Mattel will sell the dolls exclusively on Barbie.com at first while it negotiates with retailers for extra shelf space to make room for the new bodies and their clothes alongside the original. There are a seemingly infinite number of combinations of hair texture, hair cut and color, body type and skin tone. And then there’s the issue of how to package the dolls. Mothers surveyed in Mattel focus groups expressed concern over giving the new dolls to their daughter or a friend of their daughter’s. What if a sensitive mom reads into the gift of a curvy doll a comment on her daughter’s weight? Mattel decided to sell the dolls in sets to avoid this problem, but then it had to figure out which dolls to sell together to optimize diversity and marketability.

“Yes, some people will say we are late to the game,” says Mazzocco. “But changes at a huge corporation take time.”

Part 4

“Hello, I’m a fat person, fat, fat, fat,”

A 6-year-old girl giving voice for the first time to curvy Barbie sings in a testing room at Mattel’s headquarters. Her playmates erupt in laughter.

When an adult comes into the room and asks her if she sees a difference between the dolls’ bodies, she modifies her language. “This one’s a little chubbier,” she says. Girls in other sessions are similarly careful about labels. “She’s, well, you know,” says an 8-year-old as she uses her hands to gesture a curvier woman. A shy 7-year-old refuses to say the word fat to describe the doll, instead spelling it out, “F, a, t.”

“I don’t want to hurt her feelings,” she says a little desperately.

As always, Barbie acts as a Rorschach test for the girls who play with her—and the adults who evaluate her. It’s a testament to anti-bullying curriculums in elementary schools that none of the girls would use words like fat in front of an adult, which Barbie’s research team says wasn’t true even three years ago. Still, the girls learning the ways of political correctness do not as wholeheartedly embrace the new dolls as their moms.

“We see it a lot. The adult leaves the room and they undress the curvy Barbie and snicker a little bit,” says Tania Missad, who runs the research team for Mattel’s girls portfolio. “For me, it’s these moments where it just really sets in how important it is we do this. Over time I would love it if a girl wouldn’t snicker and just think of it as another beautiful doll.”

It’s a sign that even kids as young as 6 or 7 are already conditioned for a particular silhouette in their dolls, and it highlights Mattel’s challenge. Mazzocco reflects on her experience with her daughters (two Barbie fans, one not) when she talks about the diversity imperative at the brand. “I do all kinds of things for my kids that they don’t like or understand, from telling them to do their homework to eating their vegetables,” she says. “This is very similar. It’s my responsibility to make sure that they have inclusivity in their lives even if it doesn’t register for them.”

Many of the mothers in the four focus groups that Mattel allows me to observe agree with the direction Mattel is taking. And they are, after all, the ones who buy the dolls. Though young moms might be the most vocal on social media when it comes to Barbie’s body, Mattel’s extensive surveys show that moms across the country care about diversity in terms of color and body, regardless of age, race or socioeconomic position. (The majority of the women in the focus groups I watched were middle class and African American or Hispanic.)

Emily Shur for TIME

“She’s cute thick,” offers one mom who says she has a 19-year-old son and two daughters, 3 and 5. “I have the hardest time finding clothes that are fitted and look good. It’s like if you’re bigger, you have to wear a sack. But she doesn’t look like that.” A mom sporting a tattoo says that she prefers buying My Little Pony toys to any sort of dolls to avoid the body-image issue altogether, and other mothers nod in agreement. Most say the new Barbie types would make them more likely to buy Barbie.

What I Learned Watching Moms and Kids Meet Curvy Barbie

Some say Mattel didn’t go far enough. “I wish that she were curvier,” one woman wearing her uniform from her job at a restaurant complains. “There are shapes that are curvier and still are beautiful. My daughter definitely has curves, and I would want to give her a doll like that. It’s a start, I guess.”

And despite the girls who thought the curvy doll looked fat, most of the kids in the groups I observe choose their favorite doll or the doll that looks most like them based on hair, not body shape. A curvy, blue-haired doll that many girls dub Katy Perry is by far the most popular. But when asked which doll is Barbie, the girls invariably point to a blonde.

The idea that all these different dolls—none of whom look alike—can all be Barbie is confusing to moms too. “I brought my daughter to a Christmas-tree lighting with Santa and Barbie the other day,” says a mom in one of the focus groups. “If a black woman or a redheaded woman or a heavyset woman had shown up, my daughter would have been like, ‘Where’s Barbie?’” If Mattel takes away everything that makes Barbie an icon, is she still that icon? Companies work decades to create the sort of brand recognition that Barbie has. When people around the world close their eyes and think of Barbie, they see a specific body. If that body changes, Barbie could lose that status. Worse still, some customers may not like the new version. Too bad for them.

“Ultimately, haters are going to hate,” Dickson says. “We want to make sure the Barbie lovers love us more—and perhaps changing the people who are negative to neutral. That would be nice.”",16315

In the fine tradition of online publishing I took the liberty of pulling a “bait-and-click” switcheroo, and turning the hysteria surrounding the Goliath birdeater’s story into a teaching opportunity. And thus, please bear with me, and read this post to the end (where you will find the original post about the spider) before banging out an angry comment in ALL CAPS.

For some reason, probably related to the proximity of Halloween, my blog post about the Goliath birdeater spider received an inordinate amount of attention, and has been republished, reinterpreted, outright stolen, and vilified all over the Internet. This one post on my obscure blog is now receiving in excess of 120,000 unique visits every day, and comments are pouring in. Alas, most of them are somewhat less than positive, and I am beginning to wonder if I really am a “HORRIBLE person” who “will destroy the earth.” (I must admit that some of the trolls were touchingly tactful – they might have said ” F&*K you, a$$hole”, but they modified the foul words as not to offend my sensibility.) But why the vitriol?

You see, while talking to a reporter I explained that one of the specimens I describe in the blog had been collected and placed in a museum. This, combined with my comment of having seen this species only a handful of times, triggered a tsunami of self-righteous outrage at my murderous act which, according to the most vocal individuals, is bound to drive this species to extinction. In fact, I really fear for the Smithsonian Institution, this nation’s preeminent natural history collection. If a single spider collected by a scientist causes such an outrage then, surely, the 126 million specimens in its holdings will warrant burning it to the ground and crucifying all scientists working there.

But in all seriousness, why was the specimen collected? First, a bit of a background about the expedition to Guyana during which this took place. I was there with a group of biologists and Guyanese students at the invitation of the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency of Guyana. Our job was to conduct a comprehensive survey of animals and plants of the newly created Community Conservation Area, train Guyanese students in the methodology of biological surveys, and collect specimens for the Center for the Study of Biological Diversity at the University of Guyana. These specimens are used to both create permanent documentation of the species composition of a never before explored area of the country, and to train a new cadre of scientists and conservation professionals in identification and morphological diversity of organisms. And before you point out various alternative methods of documentation (photographs, sound recordings, non-destructive DNA samples), let me assure you that there is no substitute for the collection of physical specimens.

What about this particular spider? As I mention in the post below, Theraphosa blondi is indeed the largest spider in the world (although its legs are not foot long, as some media reported), and thus it makes a perfect specimen for teaching spider morphology. It is also a very common species, not protected or endangered, and collecting of a single individual poses absolutely no threat to its survival (a scientist picking up one spider is no different from a bird doing the same; if a stochastic event such as this can drive a species to extinction then this species is already doomed.) In fact, you can purchase Goliath birdeaters in many pet stores in the US or online for $20-100 a piece. But they are shy and elusive, and thus I was thrilled every time I saw one during a small handful of encounters with this species. Once the animal was properly euthanized and preserved, something that is never done lightly, it was carefully labelled and deposited in the collection in Guyana where to this day it serves as an important teaching tool. And, years from now, the same specimen may provide new data on spider anatomy, genetics, evolution etc. In addition to the spider, we also collected vouchers of 857 other species of animals and plants (excluding birds and large mammals), which are now deposited across various research institutions in Guyana, Venezuela, and the US.

Collecting and preservation of physical specimens is an integral, irreplaceable element of biological sciences. There is hardly a branch of biology that does not rely on the examination of organisms’ bodies (the only exception I can think of is ethology, and only some variants of it), be it for the purpose of their identification, understanding of the functions of their respiratory system, or the speed of transmission of neural signals. Museum collections, where specimens are preserved for future scientists, are a special, very important case. There specimens are often deposited not for a particular, clearly defined research project (such as when a geneticist examines thousands of fruit flies to measure the expression of a particular gene). Rather, collections serve as both a documentation of the current state of species composition in a particular time period or an area, or as a library of morphological and genetic diversity across a wide range of species. We cannot anticipate what questions will be asked, and answered, using specimens deposited in such collections. For example, the ban on the use of DDT, a horrible environmental pollutant, was based on the discovery made in ornithological collections that bird egg shells have been getting progressively thinner, thus leading to high mortality of birds, ever since the chemical began to be used. The spread of chytrid fungus that is wiping amphibian species across the globe was understood by examining specimens dating back a hundred years. Closer to my own research, the world’s only cave katydid is now listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List and thus receiving a greater attention from conservationists, because I found 70-year old, unidentified specimens of this species, collected by a scientist who had no idea what a remarkable animal he was catching.

Can collecting specimens for scientific research threaten a species’s survival? The short answer is no, there is absolutely no evidence that any scientist has ever driven a species to extinction. Famous New Zealand 19th century ornithologist Walter Buller is sometimes accused of having collected birds to extinction, but a close examination of the numbers of specimens collected by him proves that his work had no impact on the birds’ populations; rather, his bird collection is now a sad repository of species exterminated in New Zealand by moronic, purposeful introduction of alien species and destructive agricultural practices on the islands.

And this is the key – species are never lost as a result of scientific collecting, but almost invariably because of the destruction of their habitat, or due to competition from alien species introduced by humans. And this loss of species is happening on an unimaginable scale – by some estimates 16,000 species quietly go extinct every year, some even before scientists have a chance to describe and name them. And this is why if I see something that may be new to science, even if I suspect that it might be rare and threatened, I will collect it and deposit it in a museum. Some years ago I found a new species of katydid in South Africa. I knew that its population was tiny and on the brink of disappearance. In fact, this species is now probably extinct. Not because I collected a few individuals, but because its only population was located in a tiny patch of a native yellowwood forest within a massive pine plantation, a patch that was already being cut down to be replaced by more non-native trees grown for timber. Had I not collected a few specimens of this animal, we would have never known it existed. Now, at least its tombstone has a name – Paracilacris periclitatus, The Endangered Katydid.

I could go on and on about why scientific collecting is needed, but I want to mention one last thing. Every single one of us is guilty of involuntary bioslaughter – we kill thousands of organisms without realizing that we do it. Look into the light fixtures of your house or the grill of your car, they are full of dead insects and spiders. That highway that you drive to work – each mile of it equals millions of animals and plants that were exterminated during its construction (and if you live in an area of particularly high endemism, California or New Zealand for example, its construction probably contributed to pushing some species closer to extinction). That tofu that you eat because meat is murder – it probably comes from Brazil, where massive soy plantations stretching from one horizon to another have replaced its once thriving rainforest and led to the disappearance of thousands of species.

It is very easy to fixate on an individual case of an organism being deliberately euthanized. We do it because it is convenient emotionally – it is much easier to feel superior when we can point a finger at somebody who does it consciously, even if for a good, justifiable reason, but we don’t like to think about those trillions of animals and plants that we kill by virtue of simply going to a grocery store.

And now, enjoy the story of the Goliath birdeater.

The sound of little hooves in the night

When I go out at night into the rainforest to search for katydids I don’t like to have any company. Not that I am particularly antisocial, but tracking skittish and cryptic animals is an activity that’s better done alone. I walk slowly, trying not to disturb anything and anybody, slowly scanning the vegetation and the forest floor in the light of my headlamp. Every now and then I turn the light off to fully immerse myself in the ambient sounds of the forest, which often helps me pinpoint a faint trill made by a katydid’s wings. A few years ago I was deep in the rainforest of Guyana doing just that – listening to the sounds of the night in a complete darkness – when I heard the rustle of an animal running. I could clearly hear its hard feet hitting the ground and dry leaves crumbling under its weight. I pressed the switch and pointed the light at the source of the sound, expecting to see a small mammal, a possum, a rat maybe. And at first this is what I thought I saw – a big, hairy animal, the size of a rodent. But something wasn’t right, and for a split second the atavistic part of my brain sent a ping of regret that I didn’t bring any companion with me on this particular night walk. But before that second was over I was lunging at the animal, ecstatic about finally seeing one of these wonderful, almost mythical creatures in person.

The South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) is the largest spider in the world. For all the arachnophobes out there this is probably a good excuse to pave over large swaths of the Amazonian rainforest, but for the rest of us this species is one of biodiversity’s crown jewels. Although far from being the largest member of the subphylum Chelicerata – this honor belongs to horseshoe crabs – Goliath birdeaters are ridiculously huge for a land arthropod. Their leg span approaches 30 cm (nearly a foot) and they weigh up to 170 g – about as much as a young puppy. They truly are Goliaths, but are they bird eaters? Alas, the truth is a bit less exciting. Although definitely capable of killing small birds, they rarely have a chance to do so while scouring the forest floor at night (however, there is some anecdotal evidence that they may feed on bird eggs if they run across a nest). Rather, they seem to be feeding on what is available in this moist and warm habitat, and what is available is earthworms – lots of them.

But how do they get to be so big? Apparently, according to one study (Makarieva et al., Proc. R. Soc. B [2005] 272), it has to do with their metabolic rate, which is lower than in the Goliath birdeater’s relatives. This allows it to function with lower levels of oxygen reaching its tissues and organs than those required by smaller, more active spiders. In other words, the bigger the body the more difficult it is to provide oxygen to all its parts if the metabolic rate is to remain constant. Regardless of the reason, because of its gargantuan size, the Goliath birdeater is probably the only spider in the world that makes noise as it walks. Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse’s hooves hitting the ground (albeit, admittedly, not as loud). But this is not the only sound this spider makes.

Every time I got too close to the birdeater it would do three things. First, the spider would start rubbing its hind legs against the hairy abdomen. “Oh, how cute!”, I thought when I first saw this adorable behavior, until a cloud of urticating hair hit my eyeballs, and made me itch and cry for several days. If that wasn’t enough, the arachnid would rear its front legs and open its enormous fangs, capable of puncturing a mouse’s skull, and tried to jab me with the pointy implements. The venom of a birdeater is not deadly to humans but, in combination with massive puncture wounds the fangs were capable of inflicting, it was definitely something to be avoided. And then there was a loud hissing sound. For a long time the source of the sound was a mystery, but now we know that it is produced by “setal entanglement” – some of the hairs (setae) on the legs are covered with microscopic hooks that scrape against other, feather-like setae, producing the loud warning hiss.

A couple of years after my first encounter with Theraphosa blondi I was in South America again, walking alone at night in the rainforest of Suriname. Suddenly my foot brushed against something big and moving, and I nearly tripped. I froze, expecting a snake. “Nah, it’s just another Goliath birdeater. Aren’t you a cutie pie?”

Update 2 (28 Oct. 2014): It has been over a week since the Goliath story hit the news (isn’t it like 2.3 years in the Internet Time?), and it is probably good to let it go and refocus on another worthy cause. Thus I am closing the comments under this post, but feel free to express your opinion on any other story on this blog (but please stay topical – if you would like to tell me what you think about the spider story, or me personally, just email me). The question of scientific collecting is clearly a polarizing one but, unlike such important questions as whether God uses a Mac or Windows, it actually has one, right answer – we need scientific collecting (pdf) and it serves a wide variety of beneficial causes (pdf).

The comments that I have received demonstrate an enormous need for more science education and outreach, especially in the light of some of the most brutal ad hominem attacks coming from persons who probably would label themselves liberal and well-educated. It was rather entertaining to see the breadth of insults thrown at me, including being called, for some reason, “sexist” (interestingly, the same lady who called me that also suggested that I should “get laid, quickly” – I am puzzled, to say the least.)

Please keep visiting my blog, I am always happy when my stories raise awareness of the beautiful world of invertebrates and other underappreciated organisms, and the conservation work that I and my colleagues have been engaged in for many years.

693459931022913536,non-rumor,The Beatles' rooftop concert happened 47 years ago today. Here are 15 things you didn't know https://t.co/sfPj1EpGaJ https://t.co/GT9YrTTzL4,http://rol.st/1KKsPpj,True,Beatles' Famous Rooftop Concert: 15 Things You Didn't Know,"The Beatles' rooftop concert was the climax of a project originally titled Get Back. It was conceived as exactly that, a return to their rock roots in a desperate effort to restore unity when business and personal chaos threatened to destroy the band. A documentary crew filmed the Beatles rehearsing and recording new material for an ""honest"" album, free from the studio wizardry that had dominated their recent work. The experience pushed the group to the point of disintegration, but they needed an end to the film.

So 47 years ago — on January 30th, 1969 — the band climbed five stories to the top of their Apple Corps headquarters and played their last concert together. The album and film were ultimately released in May 1970 as Let It Be, their swan song. Here are 15 little-known facts about the Beatles' final bow on the world stage.

The concert was originally going to take place in an ancient amphitheater. Or on a cruise ship. Or in the desert.

The Beatles had many ideas about where to perform the climactic concert for their new film — too many ideas. London venues like the Palladium and the Roundhouse were some of the more levelheaded propositions, but most were pretty far-out. The Sahara desert was floated as a potential location, as were the Giza pyramids, and even the QE2 ocean liner. A 2,000-year-old Roman amphitheater in Tunisia was seriously considered, and location scouts were sent to investigate. ""The Beatles were to start playing as the sun came up,"" explained director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, ""and you'd see crowds flocking towards them through the day.""

But nothing was ever agreed upon. As enthusiasm for the project waned, the band opted to do something a little simpler and closer to home. Guest keyboard player Billy Preston recalls that it was John Lennon who had the idea to stage the concert on the roof of Apple headquarters. Lindsay-Hogg says it was his idea. Others attribute it to Ringo Starr. The concept sounds inspired, but in retrospect it speaks less to creativity and more to laziness.

Preparations were made, with scaffolding planks laid to support the weight of the gear. A few minutes before the concert was due to start, the band huddled in a small vestibule at the top of the stairs. They had cold feet. ""George didn't want to do it, and Ringo started saying he didn't really see the point,"" says Lindsay-Hogg. ""Then John said, 'Oh, fuck it — let's do it.'""

Jefferson Airplane performed on a New York City rooftop several weeks earlier.

The Beatles racked up many firsts over the course of their career, but they were not the first band to hold an unauthorized concert on a metropolitan rooftop. That distinction goes to Jefferson Airplane, who climbed to the top of midtown's Schuyler Hotel on December 7th, 1968 and surprised the city with cries of ""Hello, New York! Wake up, you fuckers! Free music! Nice songs! Free love!"" Lacking permits, they would only make it through one song — a blistering version of ""The House at Pooneil Corners"" — before the NYPD threatened arrest for noise disturbance. The band went peacefully, but their friend, actor Rip Torn, was busted for harassing an officer and taken away in a cruiser.

Mercifully, the guerrilla happening was preserved for all time by director Jean-Luc Godard, who filmed the incident as part of his One A.M. project. It's unknown whether the Beatles were directly inspired by the Airplane's antics, but press coverage (not to mention their friendship with the band) would have likely made them aware of it.

The film is directed by the secret son of Orson Welles — allegedly.

Having worked with the Beatles on their recent promotional videos for ""Hey Jude"" and ""Revolution,"" American filmmaker Lindsay-Hogg was the logical choice to direct the Get Back project. He arranged an army of cameras to capture the moment from all angles, sending a crew into the street, the adjacent building, and the Apple reception area — not to mention the five cameras on the roof itself. The result is some of the most iconic concert footage in history.

Film prowess may be in his blood. In his 2011 autobiography, Lindsay-Hogg revealed that he believes himself to be the only son of cinema giant Orson Welles. His mother, actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, publically denied the rampant rumors, but she allegedly acknowledged the truth to family friend Gloria Vanderbilt. When Welles' oldest daughter supported Lindsay-Hogg's claim, he submitted to a DNA test. The results were inconclusive.

Lennon and Starr wore their ladies' coats.

It was 45 degrees in London that raw January afternoon, and that doesn't account for the icy wind whipping over the West End buildings. Impending fog had ruled out an expensive helicopter aerial shot, and the threat of rain was very real. These conditions were not ideal to making rock and roll. ""[My] hands [are] too cold to play the chords,"" Lennon muttered between songs, and Apple Corps exec Ken Mansfield held a constant stream of lit cigarettes so George Harrison could warm his fingertips. To ward off the winter chill, Lennon borrowed Yoko Ono's fur coat (as he did on occasion). Ringo Starr also donned his wife Maureen's red raincoat.

The microphones were wrapped in women's pantyhose.

The cold gusts also proved to be a problem for the delicate studio microphones recording the drums and guitar amplifiers. In need of a quick shield to minimize wind noise, tape engineer (and future Pink Floyd cohort) Alan Parsons was dispatched that morning to buy women's pantyhose. ""I walked into this department store and said, 'I need three pairs of pantyhose. It doesn't matter what size.'"" he recalled in Guitar Player. ""They thought I was either a bank robber or a cross-dresser.""

It was their first live performance in over two years.

Famously cited as the Beatles' last concert, the rooftop gig was also their first live performance in more than two years. While they had played ""All You Need Is Love"" and ""Hey Jude"" before a studio audience on television during that time, those numbers were heavily bolstered by a backing track. The roof was their first truly live show since their final tour ended on August 29th, 1966, at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. They also made a small break from tradition by varying their classic stage placements. Lennon took the middle spot with Harrison to his left.

George Harrison's guitar was the first of its kind.

The Telecaster that Harrison played throughout the rooftop concert was custom made for him by master builders Roger Rossmeisl and Philip Kubicki as a gift from Fender. The company was launching a new line of all-rosewood guitars, and presenting the prototype to a Beatle was good publicity. After many hours of labor, the guitar was flown to England in its own seat and hand-delivered to Apple headquarters. The builders weren't sure what became of the guitar for over a year, until they bought tickets to see the Let It Be film and saw their handiwork on the big screen. ""I was so thrilled I almost jumped out of my seat,"" remembers Kubicki.

John Lennon needed cue cards to remember his own lyrics.

John Lennon always had a problem with lyrics. Paul McCartney often recalls seeing Lennon onstage singing his own ad-libbed words to the Del Vikings' ""Come Go With Me"" on the day they met in 1957. Wanting to get things reasonably correct for the film, the Beatles asked Apple office assistant Kevin Harrington to kneel just out of camera view and hold up a lyric sheet for ""Dig a Pony."" Lennon still managed a memorable flub during ""Don't Let Me Down,"" singing something like, ""And only reese we got the blootchy-koo.""

""One After 909 "" is one of the earliest Lennon-McCartney compositions the Beatles released.

While ""I Call Your Name,"" ""What Goes On,"" and several others also vie for the title, ""One After 909"" is likely the very earliest complete Lennon-McCartney songwriting effort released on an original Beatles album. Lennon claimed that he wrote it when he was 17 years old with a little help from his new friend, Paul McCartney. ""It's not a great song,"" McCartney remembered in later years. ""But it's a great favorite of mine because it has great memories for me of John and I trying to write a bluesy freight-train song.""

The band had originally recorded ""One After 909"" at EMI Studios during sessions for ""From Me to You"" in March 1963. This version was shelved, but the song was resurrected six years later for the Get Back/Let It Be project — as a joke more than anything else. The live version from the rooftop concert ended up on Let It Be, giving ""One After 909"" its long-awaited public debut on the last album they issued.

There were other songs performed on the rooftop that day.

While 21 minutes of the concert made it into the final Let It Be film, the actual performance was twice as long. During the 42-minute set, the Beatles played ""One After 909,"" two complete versions each of ""Don't Let Me Down,"" ""Dig a Pony"" and ""I've Got a Feeling,"" and three versions of ""Get Back"" — plus various incomplete takes, including a line from the Irish folk song ""Danny Boy.""

In addition to these, the band tossed off snippets of several songs that didn't make the cut for Let It Be. These include a few bars of ""I Want You,"" later released on Abbey Road, and lines from the Irving Berlin chestnut ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody."" The most complete of these off-the-cuff performances is an instrumental version of ""God Save the Queen,"" played while engineer Alan Parsons changed tape reels. These were little more than jokes, and were never seriously considered for any official release.

The police weren't as bad as they've been made out to be.

Beatles lore portrays the London Metropolitan Police as the prototypical blue meanies who forcibly halted one of the greatest musical moments of the 1960s. To a certain extent, this is true. But the bobbies actually cut the band some slack — and did them a serious solid.

The West End Central Police Station is located at 27 Savile Row — mere feet from Apple headquarters. The authorities obviously must have heard the loud rock music wafting down the street. Windows rattled, floors shook, and horns blared from the resulting traffic jams. If they wanted to, the police could have walked over and shut things down before the first song was over. Instead, they let the concert continue for 42 minutes. It was only when the noise complaints began to flood in from stuffy local businesses that they felt compelled to act.

Even then, they gave the Beatles and Co. ample warning to get rid of certain illicit substances that might have been on the scene. ""Before the raid, someone called from the Savile Row police station saying, 'You've got 10 minutes.'"" recalled one Apple employee. ""So we knew they were coming and everyone was ready for it. ... When the police raided the building, there was a whole chorus of toilets being flushed."" Crisis averted.

The set list may have ended up being longer.

Because the concert was cut short by the police, fans have spent decades theorizing what other songs — if any — the Beatles might have performed had they continued. Some eagle-eyed rock scholars have noticed equipment in the background of the Apple roof set that went unused, including an extra keyboard, a lap-steel guitar and what appears to be an acoustic-guitar microphone positioned by McCartney. Were folky songs like ""Two of Us"" originally in the mix? Was McCartney going to try out some of his piano-based ballads like ""Let It Be"" and ""The Long and Winding Road""? Could Lennon have used the lap-steel guitar as he did on ""For You Blue,"" giving Harrison his first (and only) solo vocal of the day?

It's hard to know for certain. Some fans believe Harrison asked that his songs not be played on the roof that day. Others argue that these quieter numbers would have been impossible to record in the windy and uncontrolled setting. It also seems unlikely that the Beatles would have repeated so many songs if they also intended to perform others. But why the extra instruments? Perhaps the band's roadies received vague instructions to bring their equipment up to the roof, and simply grabbed everything they could find. To date, no set list has ever been found.

Billy Preston received the only official Beatles co-credit.

Friends with the Beatles since touring Europe with Little Richard in 1962, Billy Preston is the MVP of the entire Get Back/Let It Be project. Band relations had deteriorated so badly that Harrison actually walked out on the sessions, vowing to quit the group all together. To clear his head, he attended a Ray Charles concert, where Preston happened to be playing organ. Harrison invited him back to the studio to jam with the rest of the Beatles. His warm nature soothed tensions and his keyboard chops added a dose of excitement to the formerly dreary proceedings.

Preston's sparking musical contribution on Let It Be speaks for itself. Lennon even lobbied to make Preston a full member of the band — an actual fifth Beatle. ""It's bad enough with four!"" McCartney supposedly replied. Even so, his importance was recognized on the single release of ""Get Back,"" which is credited to ""The Beatles with Billy Preston."" Barring unauthorized reissues, it was the first time that the Beatles credited anyone on their records in this way.

Preston would go on to record with the Beatles on Abbey Road that summer, laying down keyboard parts on ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" and ""Something.""

The site of the rooftop concert is now a children's Abercrombie & Fitch.

The Beatles purchased 3 Savile Row in 1968 as the headquarters for Apple Corps. They constructed a studio in the basement, which they used to record the second half of their Get Back/Let It Be sessions. Harry Nilsson, Badfinger, Marc Bolan and others also recorded there before Apple sold the building in 1976. It changed hands a number of times over the years until it was purchased by Abercrombie & Fitch in 2012. A children's clothing store currently resides in the building's ground floor — throwing London tailors, historians and Beatle fans into an uproar.

It's the last sound you hear on the Beatles' final release.

Although Abbey Road was the final album to be recorded by the four Beatles, Let It Be was the last to be issued in May 1970, weeks after the group's split made headlines around the world. The black-trimmed cover gave it funereal quality, and fans anxiously studied to the parting message from the foursome that defined the Sixties.

As ""Get Back,"" the last track, draws to a close, the sound of John Lennon's voice can be heard: ""I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition."" It was a self-effacing remark made at the end of the rooftop show, poking fun at the many auditions the band failed over the years. It was also a humble nod to the band's unprecedented success — and, inadvertently, the perfect Beatles epitaph.",14954

Some Well-Known Sources of Seed Capital for a New Business

Where can one go to get the start-up financing needed to get a new small business off the ground?

You can start brand new business on Kickstarter, or high quality service for a popular CMS, like Bob WP, you need fund (laptops, servers, softwares, licences, acoounting, office, coffee, etc.).

This page takes a brief look at several, more traditional funding alternatives.

Though these financing options come with many requirements and have a longer approval processes, they generally come with benefits, such as access to larger amounts of money and a formalized repayment process.

Government-Based Loans and Grants

There are several government-based financing programs available for starting up a new small business. This is definitely an area worth looking in to for the needed seed capital.

Just keep in mind that when it comes to government grants (as opposed to loans) most of this money is directed at non-profit organizations or is limited to very specific sectors.

Even if an entrepreneur is able to qualify for a grant, this money will probably come with a lot of restrictions on use as well as other requirements.

One can start searching for government-based loans and grants by checking out the following sites:

Business.usa.gov- Information on finding small business loans, seed and venture capital, and government grants.

Grants.gov- Find and apply for federal grants.

Small Business Association- Various types of small business loans and other resources

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance- A full listing of Federal programs, grants, projects, and services available to state and local governments

One should also contact the local Small Business Development Center to see which financial assistance programs they offer. Moreover, there are several, specific options for women and minorities.

Venture Capital and Angel Investment

Angel capital is equity capital from wealthy individuals and experienced entrepreneurs, while venture capital is also made up of private funds, but comes from institutional investors.

Both forms of capital are generally offered to new companies with the potential for profitability and rapid growth in exchange for ownership shares and influence over company decisions. Angel investors, like venture capitalists, make their return on investment in the event of an Initial Public Offering or the trade sale of the funded companies.

For a list of angel investors, one can check out the Angel Capital Association; for a searchable directory of venture capitalists go to Vfinance.com.

Small Business Loans from Banks and Commercial Lenders

One of the most well-known forms of small business finance is the traditional small business loan provided by banks and commercial lenders. These loans generally come in two flavors: a secured loan that is back by collateral and an unsecured loan.

Pursuing this financing option, however, may not be so successful. Banks and commercial lenders are generally reluctant to finance small business start-ups especially at a time when the economy is weak.

One can start a search in this area by calling local banks and asking them if they are funding small business start-ups at present. If the answer is yes, then one can request a list of requirements for approval.

Equipment leasing

By leasing equipment, instead of purchasing it, a new business owner can reduce the amount of capital needed to get a small business up and running. Another added benefit is that equipment leasing helps small business owners avoid purchasing equipment that will soon become obsolete or inadequate.

There are several equipment financing options available to small businesses, so be sure to do a little research before making a decision.

4 Small Business Startup Essentials to Get the Doors Open

There are many important tasks that need to be accomplished before official small business startup in order to avoid snags down the line.

Starting a small business can be really exciting. But new business owners that forget important details before their doors open can find themselves with time management issues, or with cash flow problems when no clients come.

The following 4 small business tips can help new company owners get their affairs in order before the doors open to avoid business-breaking catastrophes down the line.

A Startup Timeline is a Lifesaver. The second the idea to start a new venture comes into an entrepreneur’s head, he/she needs to immediately pick an official and realistic “start” date for the business and start building a timeline for what is going to happen between that moment and the date the business will open its doors. Many are afraid to choose a start date in the beginning, because they see it as a scary “deadline” by which they must get a huge number of tasks done. The reality of this deadline can often be overwhelming, but it is necessary to keep on task and help with time management. Also, while those engaged in the process of building a new company should stick to the small business startup date, there is always room to change if unexpected obstacles hit or some tasks take longer than expected. Seeing a physical timeline can be a great motivator during the months before officially opening a business, and is important to organization and setting a precedent for diligent time management that will help in all areas of business. A Manageable To-Do List Helps Keep the Timeline Reasonable. Savvy entrepreneurs need to sit down once they decide to start a company and write down a list of the “Top 10” tasks that need to be accomplished before the business officially opens its doors. For example, they may need to secure office space, set up a business-dedicated phone and Internet access, get a small business license and insurance or any other number of things. But these to-dos need to go in order of their importance on the timeline, as they will determine the length of time required to responsibly start the business. Every Startup Needs a Preliminary Marketing Plan. Marketing tools may sound like premature assets to create for those that have not yet even officially opened up shop. But one of the first things on any professional to-do list for those just starting out should be to create a first-draft of a marketing plan. Small business startups need to get basic marketing portfolio components like business cards, domain names and a business e-mail address and then start to research and plan how they will market and sell services. Building a Small Business Network Starts Early. Building a small business network will be critical to bringing in steady clients for all entrepreneurs, regardless of industry. In the beginning, clients and business contacts will likely be friends, family members, former co-workers or others that have been referred by any of the above. But eventually, this well will run dry. One of the best small business tips entrepreneurs can follow at any stage of a company’s development is to keep going out into the community and meeting people that might benefit from available products or services.

Business Planning Software for a Startup Company

Create Financial Projections and use Strategic Planning Templates

Small business planning software features should include strategic planning templates. Sample planning documents help create financial projections for a startup company.

Starting a small business can be highly complicated. Even if the business will be privately funded, creating business plans helps to map out the expected changes in operations over the course of the first several years.

Strategic planning provides a guide for the administrative functions of a small company. Business plans include this information, but also require marketing plans and other information, including financial projections.

Business Financial Planning in Software

Business financial planning software used for a small business startup can simplify the process of creating financial projections. Before starting a company, it is difficult to make estimates, and many entrepreneurs end up simply guessing. Business financial planning software provides templates and guides to ensure that financial projections are based on fact, rather than guesswork.

Small Business Financial Planning

Small business financial planning requires more than a simple startup budget and cash on hand. There is a great deal of planning required for a business, even a small home-based company. Using software applications to create financial projections makes the process easier, but there is still a great deal of information to gather. Some of this information may include:

Evaluating the competition can determine the relative profit that can be expected from selling a particular product.

Gathering demographics and common purchasing power of the target market provides information for projecting sales.

Estimating capital costs for the first year of business gives business owners an idea of the amount of startup capital needed.

Detailing a list of company assets, including cash and equipment, as well as any additional items required for operations, provides a clear view of any additional expenditures that may be necessary.

Small Business Planning Software

Small business planning software comes in many varieties, and many levels of expense. Each business owner should review software reviews, and investigate available features carefully prior to purchase. This improves the chances that the software applications that are purchased live up to the developer’s promises and contain all the features needed for a small business startup.

Strategy Planning Software

Strategy planning software may be included in business planning applications, or may be separate. Purchasing software that includes strategic planning templates saves both time and money. Information that should be included in a strategic plan is typically administrative in nature.

Company goals, vision, and mission, for example, would be included in this document. In addition, the objectives of each of the company’s activities should be included. This portion of the document should be updated frequently, or as activities and circumstances change.

One of Donald Trump’s top campaign strategists, former communications director Stephanie Cegielski, has resigned from his campaign in protest of Trump’s ridiculous statement that “only he can solve” the bombing in Pakistan (whatever that might mean). She has penned a devastating open letter to his supporters, explaining to us why she originally supported Trump, and how his excess and dishonesty turned her against him. She issues a stark warning to Trump supporters that the supposed “authenticity” of Trump is nothing but smoke and mirrors, a soap opera character – and that at the end of the day, Donald Trump only cares about himself. A brutal denunciation of Trump as both a candidate and a person, it might be the most complete evisceration of the orange-haired rabble-rouser yet written.

It will be interesting to see if Donald Trump’s supporters will be able to dismiss this evisceration so easily. They can’t cry “liberal media” or establishment bias – this comes from inside his own camp, the people who know him better than any of his supporters. It’s also a significant indication that Trump’s own advisers are becoming increasingly tired of his racist antics and his utter refusal to formulate any kind of substantial policy proposals. They recognize that he is utterly unprepared for the presidency and has no desire to change that.

An Open Letter to Trump Voters from His Top Strategist-Turned-Defector

Even Trump’s most trusted advisors didn’t expect him to fare this well. Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it. The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.

It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority. And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.

My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn’t look promising.

In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.

I was sold. Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC. It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.

That was inspiring to me. It wasn’t long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.

But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.

I don’t think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.

He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver’s seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy. A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, “Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.”

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?

This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever. Superhero powers where “I alone can solve” problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.

What was once Trump’s desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

I’ll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now. You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.

He doesn’t want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.

The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump. And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.

He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump’s voice. Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many “pieces of ass.” He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.

In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign’s internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency onThe West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet’s staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”

Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became “Let Trump Be Trump.”

It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogan is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.

Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought “Common Core” was a class at Equinox.

The primary problem with this? What I’ve seen the longer I’ve helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, “Let Trump Help Trump.”

I don’t dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it’s important to let you know that the candidate does.

I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.

The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.

I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.

I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his “build a wall” stump speech and talked about his greatness.

I felt sad for him at that moment.

And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.

I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.

He is not.

He even says so himself. His misogyny? That’s the character.

His presidential candidacy? That’s a character, too.

The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.

Trump made me believe. Until I woke up. And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.

I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump’s outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.

While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.

And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.

But something was shifting.

Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.

I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.

And here’s what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.

Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.

Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.

I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.

When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.

Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.

Trump acts as if he’s a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump isa work of fiction.

No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the “best” at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other “best” claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.

He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

Don’t let our country pay that price.

According to Riverside County Sheriffs, David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin held 13 malnourished children ranging in age from 2 to 29 captive in their Perris, California home. Deputies were alerted after a 17-year-old daughter escaped by jumping through a window shortly before dawn, carrying a de-activated mobile phone from which she was able to call 911 for help. Responding deputies described conditions in the home as foul-smelling with some kids chained to a bed and suffering injuries as a result. Adult children appeared at first to be minors because of their malnourished state. The Turpins were arrested on charges of torture and child endangerment. Getty

Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.

The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.

It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.

And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.

My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.

In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.

I was sold.

Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.

It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.

That was inspiring to me.

It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.

But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.

I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.

He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.

A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?

This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.

Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.

What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

[READ: IT HAPPENED TO ME: Donald Trump Ruined My Relationship]

I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.

You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.

He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.

The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.

And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.

He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.

Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.

In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”

Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""

It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.

Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.

[READ: I Thought I'd Be Fine When My Wife Opened Our Marriage, But I Got Drunk and Freaked Out]

The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""

I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.

I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.

The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.

I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.

I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.

I felt sad for him at that moment.

And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.

I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.

He is not.

He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.

His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.

The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.

Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.

And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.

I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.

While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.

[READ: Don't Be So Sure That Donald Trump Can't Win the Republican Nomination — Or the Presidency]

And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.

But something was shifting.

Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.

I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.

And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.

Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.

Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.

I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.

When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.

Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.

Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.

No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ""best"" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other ""best"" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.

He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.

The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""

I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.

I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.

The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.

I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.

I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.

I felt sad for him at that moment.

And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.

I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.

He is not.

He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.

His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.

The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.

Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.

And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.

I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.

While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.

And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.

But something was shifting.

Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.

I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.

And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.

Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.

Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.

I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.

When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.

Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.

Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.

No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ""best"" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other ""best"" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.

He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.

The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.

It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.

And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.

My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.

In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.

I was sold.

Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.

It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.

That was inspiring to me.

It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.

But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.

I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.

He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.

A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

Ignoring the fact that at the time Trump tweeted this (time-stamped 4:37 p.m.) the latest news reports had already placed the number differently at 70 dead, 300 injured, take a moment to appreciate the ridiculous, cartoonish, almost childish arrogance of saying that he alone can solve. Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?

This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.

Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.

What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

[READ: IT HAPPENED TO ME: Donald Trump Ruined My Relationship]

I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.

You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.

He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.

The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.

And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.

He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.

Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.

In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”

Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""

It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.

Does Trump think that he is making a cameo on Wrestlemania (yes, one of his actual credits)?

This is not how foreign policy works. For anyone. Ever.

Superhero powers where ""I alone can solve"" problems are not real. They do not exist for Batman, for Superman, for Wrestlemania and definitely not for Donald Trump.

What was once Trump's desire to rank second place to send a message to America and to increase his power as a businessman has nightmarishly morphed into a charade that is poised to do irreparable damage to this country if we do not stop this campaign in its tracks.

I'll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate. But his pride is too out of control to stop him now.

You can give Trump the biggest gift possible if you are a Trump supporter: stop supporting him.

He doesn't want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could have run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there is any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate succeed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.

The hard truth is: Trump only cares about Trump.

And if you are one of the disaffected voters — one of the silent majority like me — who wanted a candidate who could be your voice, I want to speak directly to you as one of his biggest advocates and supporters.

He is not that voice. He is not your voice. He is only Trump's voice.

Trump is about Trump. Not one of his many wives. Not one of his many ""pieces of ass."" He is, at heart, a self-preservationist.

In fact, many people are not aware of the Trump campaign's internal slogan, but I will tell you. It is stolen from a make-believe television presidency on The West Wing where Martin Sheen portrayed President Bartlet. The slogan on the show amongst the idealistic group of Bartlet's staff was “Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.”

Inside the Trump camp, the slogan became ""Let Trump Be Trump.""

It is a repurposed slogan that seemed spot-on for the candidate. He is an intelligent, charismatic man who is involved in every aspect of his organization and would rather speak from the cuff than read briefing notes and recite them. I, in fact, admire Trump for this. But saying this qualifies him to be president is like saying that Seth Rogen is suited to be president. Another extraordinary improvisor, not an extraordinary presidential candidate.

Trump has undoubtedly lived up to the slogan, right down to his main public-relations liaison. Rather than go for a focus-group Washington insider, his communications person had previously taken press calls for the Trump Organization and directed them to the appropriate Trump child. She joked that before joining the campaign she thought ""Common Core"" was a class at Equinox.

The primary problem with this? What I've seen the longer I've helped prop him up along with the millions who are helping Trump is that we got the slogan wrong. A more accurate internal slogan would read, ""Let Trump Help Trump.""

I don't dismiss any single Trump constituent, which is why I believe it's important to let you know that the candidate does.

I, too, think our country has gone off track in its values. I, too, think that we need a dramatic change of course. But I am, in my heart, a policy wonk and a believer in coming to the table with necessary knowledge for leading the free world.

The man does not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not know — the most frightening position of all.

I remember watching the second Trump debate and thinking, After this, he is going to have to start hammering it home on policy; the country needs substance to make an informed decision.

I wished for it six months ago and am still waiting for it today. He had an opportunity after the terror attacks in Belgium and instead he used the opportunity to talk about closing the borders and what a mess that country had become. I was appalled that he offered no condolences or words of support; he merely gave his ""build a wall"" stump speech and talked about his greatness.

I felt sad for him at that moment.

And now, with the latest horrifying terror attack in Pakistan, my sadness has turned into anger.

I consider myself a part of the silent majority that led to Trump’s rise, which is why I want you to know that I am with you — I wanted Trump to be real, too.

He is not.

He even says so himself. His misogyny? That's the character.

His presidential candidacy? That's a character, too.

The problem with characters is they are the stuff of soap operas and sitcoms and reality competitions — not political legacies.

Trump made me believe. Until I woke up.

And he has no problem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and women out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.

I came into this eager to support a savvy businessman who received little outside funding. I loved Trump's outsider status. But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump.

While the pundits pontificated about what type of PR stunt Trump had up his billion-dollar sleeves, I met with people who convinced me he was serious about changing the political conversation. I wanted to raise millions for him. I wanted to contribute to millions of votes.

[READ: Don't Be So Sure That Donald Trump Can't Win the Republican Nomination — Or the Presidency]

And as part of that support, in October, I supported the internal decision to close the Super PAC in order to position him as the quintessential non-politician. I still supported him with great passion after that. The decision to close the Super PAC was part of that devotion to his message of outsider change.

But something was shifting.

Without intending to do so, I began to hear and evaluate him more critically and skeptically as a member of the voting public rather than a communications person charged with protecting his positions.

I no longer felt that he was the leader the country was looking for, and I found myself longing — aching, really — for policy substance that went beyond building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. What were once bold — although controversial — statements now seemed to be attempts to please the crowds, not direction to lead this country to a better place. I began to realize his arrogance and isolation had taken over and were now controlling his message.

And here's what he tapped into: the unprecedented, unbelievable anger.

Because we are all angry — and we all have a right to be. But Trump is not our champion. He would stab any one of his supporters in the back if it earned him a cent more in his pocket.

Unfortunately, the more vitriolic Trump has become, the more the people responded to him. That drove him to push the boundaries further and further.

I also started seeing a trend of incompetence and deniability.

When there was a tweet that contained an error, he would blame it on an intern; when there was a photo containing a World War II Nazi Germany background, he would blame it on an intern; when he answered questions in an overtly controversial fashion, he would claim that he did not properly hear the question. He refused to take responsibility for his actions while frequently demanding apologies from others.

Imagine Trump wronged you, even in the smallest possible way. He would go to the grave denying he had ever done anything wrong to you — ever.

Trump acts as if he's a fictional character. But like Hercules, Donald Trump is a work of fiction.

No matter how many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ""best"" at being a president, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever other ""best"" claim he has made in the last 15 minutes.

He would be the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald Trump — at all costs.

Almost a year ago, recruited for my public relations and public policy expertise, I sat in Trump Tower being told that the goal was to get The Donald to poll in double digits and come in second in delegate count. That was it.

The Trump camp would have been satisfied to see him polling at 12% and taking second place to a candidate who might hold 50%. His candidacy was a protest candidacy.

It pains me to say, but he is the presidential equivalent of Sanjaya on American Idol. President Trump would be President Sanjaya in terms of legitimacy and authority.

And I am now taking full responsibility for helping create this monster — and reaching out directly to those voters who, like me, wanted Trump to be the real deal.

My support for Trump began probably like yours did. Similar to so many other Americans, I was tired of the rhetoric in Washington. Negativity and stubbornness were at an all-time high, and the presidential prospects didn't look promising.

In 2015, I fell in love with the idea of the protest candidate who was not bought by corporations. A man who sat in a Manhattan high-rise he had built, making waves as a straight talker with a business background, full of successes and failures, who wanted America to return to greatness.

I was sold.

Last summer, I signed on as the Communications Director of the Make America Great Again Super PAC.

It was still early in the Trump campaign, and we hit the ground running. His biggest competitor had more than $100 million in a Super PAC. The Jeb Bush deep pockets looked to be the biggest obstacle we faced. We seemed to be up against a steep challenge, especially since a big part of the appeal of a Trump candidacy was not being influenced by PAC money.

[READ: Donald Trump's Hate Speech Is Breeding Violence and There Is More to Come]

After the first debate, I was more anxious than ever to support Trump. The exchange with Megyn Kelly was like manna from heaven for a communications director. She appeared like yet another reporter trying to kick out the guest who wasn’t invited to the party. At the time, I felt excited for the change to the debate he could bring. I began realizing the man really resonates with the masses and would bring people to the process who had never participated before.

That was inspiring to me.

It wasn't long before every day I awoke to a buzzing phone and a shaking head because Trump had said something politically incorrect the night before. I have been around politics long enough to know that the other side will pounce on any and every opportunity to smear a candidate.

But something surprising and absolutely unexpected happened. Every other candidate misestimated the anger and outrage of the “silent majority” of Americans who are not a part of the liberal elite. So with each statement came a jump in the polls. Just when I thought we were finished, The Donald gained more popularity.

I don't think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.

He certainly was never prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego has now taken over the driver's seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald does not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own biggest enemy.

A devastating terrorist attack in Pakistan targeting Christians occurred on Easter Sunday, and Trump’s response was to tweet, ""Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead, 400 injured. I alone can solve.""

670380354822348801,non-rumor,They left Syria in 2013 for a camp in Jordan and arrived in Detroit last week. Their story https://t.co/5LNZuSNMXz https://t.co/xBigxLbY5I,http://nyti.ms/1Os3a8e,True,A Chill Grips a Michigan Haven for Syrian Families,"Sentiments like those are especially jarring in Michigan, which has one of the largest and most vibrant Arab-American populations in the country and a vocal group of advocates for bringing more Syrian refugees to the United States. In the Detroit suburbs, refugees have traded a harrowing war in the Middle East for cold winters, strip malls and subdivisions with houses as uniform as Monopoly pieces.

The United States has accepted more than 1,800 Syrian refugees since October 2014. Michigan has welcomed close to 200 — more than any other state except California and Texas. The Obama administration has said it wants to bring in at least 10,000 in the next year.

Those plans have been threatened by the sudden and contentious debate over whether these refugees, many of them young children, are security threats. On Thursday, the Republican-led House voted overwhelmingly to impose new screening procedures on refugees from Syria. After Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican, said he did not want any more Syrian refugees in his state, one Syrian family destined for Indianapolis was rerouted to Connecticut.

In explaining Mr. Snyder’s opposition to Syrians coming to Michigan, his spokesman, David Murray, said the state remained “unwavering” in its commitment to helping refugees.

“But our first priority is to keep Michiganders safe,” Mr. Murray said. “After tragedies such as we’ve seen in France, Lebanon and in the skies above Egypt in recent weeks, it’s proper to pause and review background and safety procedures with our partners in the federal government.”

Regardless, advocates for refugees say they have no intention to stop helping them settle here. Many more Syrian families who have waited for refugee status for years are destined for Michigan in the coming months.

Mr. Mughrbel, who arrived with his family in July, bristled at the suggestion that refugees like him could be a threat.

“We didn’t cross illegally,” he said. He threw his hands in the air. “We went through hell to get here.”

Escape From War

That hell started in Homs more than four years ago.

The government, under President Bashar al-Assad, had cracked down on the rebellious city, religious sects were at war with one another, and the deadly mix of bombings, snipers and random violence forced many residents indoors. Ms. Hammadeh was afraid to leave their home to shop for fresh food. On some days, the family resorted to eating moldy bread.

The couple’s sons, Soubei and Ahmad, now 19 and 18, were then in their early teens, and their parents began to fear they would be kidnapped.

Photo

“We got scared,” Ms. Hammadeh said. “The government would see kids on the street and take them, beat them. We didn’t want them to kidnap our children.”

In November 2011, they resolved to leave.

Everything had to be left behind: furniture, photos, nearly all of their clothes. The only exception was Ms. Hammadeh’s gold wedding band and two bracelets that she slipped onto her wrist. Once the family arrived in Jordan, she sold them all for about $230.

Life in their temporary country was expensive and difficult. Mr. Mughrbel’s brother, who had also fled to Jordan, died of a heart attack. Mr. Mughrbel blamed stress.

After months of grueling trips to the United Nations refugee agency in Amman for repeated hourslong interviews as part of the refugee process, they found out they would be going to the United States.

Photo

“Our life was about to change,” Mr. Mughrbel said in Arabic through a translator. “We were going to have a safe future for our kids, live a happy life, be in a better environment, be treated like a real person.”

Before departing for the United States, he and his family attended four days of orientation, where they were instructed in the ways of American life. How to drive a car. How to throw banana peels and other trash in a garbage can, not on the ground.

They were also schooled in what they should focus on when they arrived. Learn English, they were told. Find a job, because America is all about work. The United States is a wonderful place, they were told. People will respect you.

On their first morning in their new Michigan apartment, they marveled at the lawns and trees. “We didn’t walk around because we were afraid we would get lost,” Mr. Mughrbel said. “So we just looked out the window.”

Photo

“When I saw all the grass,” said Ms. Hammadeh, 43, her large eyes widening, “I felt that I was reborn.”

She sheepishly recounted trivial missteps. A used minivan, bought for $2,500, was accidentally filled with premium gas. An unfamiliar shampoo seemed to make her hair go temporarily thin.

But after four months, the family says it is financially independent, living on the earnings of the two sons, who work in a factory. Mr. Mughrbel, a cook and butcher in his native Syria, has found occasional work in a restaurant and, once his English is better, would like to open one of his own. Sometimes the family piles into the van after dinner at home and visits other Syrian families for coffee and gossip.

At home last week, family members bustled around as a soccer game played on the television, their preferred alternative to CNN and all its bleak bulletins. The smell of eggplant and spices wafted from the galley kitchen. A glance through the sliding patio doors revealed other modest but well-kept brick apartment buildings nearby.

They have kept their lives small, mostly going to work and back, and occasionally to the mosque. Mr. Mughrbel condemned the attacks in Paris. “These are criminals,” he said. “We are against this kind of stuff. You can’t just walk and kill somebody in the street. God won’t forgive you.”

Familiar Support

The task of keeping an eye on the new refugees has fallen to many of the 3,000 Syrian-Americans who have settled near Detroit for generations, a group known for its prosperity and devotion to higher education.

“There’s a significant number of Syrians here, so if the refugees don’t have relatives, they’ll at least have a lot of cultural connections,” said Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “Our community in general has been very welcoming to refugees, irrespective to their national origin.”

Many established Syrians have formed volunteer organizations to assist in the resettlement process; supplied the refugees with furniture, clothing and food; and procured apartments, often at a discounted rent.

Photo

“We’re trying to help them find their way once they are here,” said Mahmoud Altattan, 65, the owner of Altas Greenfield Market, an emporium of produce, jarred olives, nuts and pita breads in Southfield, a Detroit suburb. “They have some difficulty adjusting at first. We try to put them on the right path.”

New refugees have come to his store in search of familiar comforts: pumpkin seeds, sweets and coffees from their native country. Mr. Altattan, who arrived in the United States from Syria 27 years ago and speaks softly accented English, said he advised the refugees that their most important task was to learn the language.

“Most of the Syrian community is educated people, doctors, lawyers,” said Mr. Altattan, who proudly noted that he counts a doctor and lawyer among his four grown children. “The new Syrians who are coming now are not so educated.”

Refugee resettlement officials say many of the new refugees have worked in blue-collar jobs in Syria, as carpenters, cooks, tailors and drivers. Many were poor and vulnerable when they fled.

Photo

Case managers for the agencies that assist with resettlement spend the first few months of refugees’ time in the United States in a sort of hand-holding: making nearly daily visits to their homes, helping them book doctor’s appointments and register their children for school, and driving them to the grocery store.

“When refugees arrive to the country, they don’t know what to do,” said Jewan Poulis, a program coordinator with Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, an agency that has received about one or two Syrian families each week since June. “They have no clue what’s going on.”

Amer Sharaf, a 36-year-old Syrian refugee who arrived in Michigan in August, said he and his family had been warmly embraced by the older Syrians, who helped them by donating furniture and translating bills. A house painter when he lived in Syria, he found a job here in an automotive factory, making $9 an hour and working 50 hours a week.

But in his family’s apartment last week, as he and his wife, Marvat Mando, sipped Turkish coffee and watched their children read e-books on iPads provided by their public school, he turned to a new and troubling subject: the terrorist attacks in Paris and the governor’s subsequent criticism of Syrian refugees.

Photo

“It’s wrong,” Mr. Sharaf said. “Why is what happened everybody’s fault?”

Another Arrival

Last Tuesday afternoon, refugee specialists were gathered in a conference room at the suburban Detroit offices of Lutheran Social Services, discussing their final preparations for the arrival of a family of Syrian refugees on Wednesday evening.

Hani Aziz, a refugee specialist who is an Iraqi refugee himself, was assigned to pick up the family of three at 8 p.m., at the end of a long journey flying from Jordan to Frankfurt to Chicago and, finally, to Detroit.

Two days earlier, Mr. Snyder had proclaimed his opposition to new Syrian refugees entering the state. The specialists mentioned his name defiantly.

“If Snyder’s at the airport tomorrow, pushing them back onto the plane, then we know he’s for real,” Sean de Four, the vice president of children and family services at the agency, said wryly.

But when Wednesday evening came, the family’s flight was delayed for almost four hours. Standing in the arrivals terminal beneath an enormous Christmas wreath, Mr. Aziz scanned the crowds nervously, not knowing anything about the family except for names.

Finally, just after midnight, the family emerged, looking remarkably unrumpled: Nayef Buteh, 45; his wife, Feryal Jabur, 41; and their 8-year-old son, Arab.

Ms. Jabur was poised and elegant but sank onto a bench near the baggage claim.

“It was very tiring,” she said through a translator, looking glassy-eyed and exhausted. The couple’s son, wearing a black bomber jacket and jeans, slumped wordlessly next to her and lowered his dark eyelashes.

Mr. Buteh was polite but agitated, his eyes darting toward the exit. It had been 10 hours since his last cigarette. He stepped out into the mild November air and lit up.

“Thank God,” he said in Arabic, taking a deep drag.

Worn down by the grinding war in Syria, the family fled in March 2013 on the bed of a pickup, destined for a refugee camp in Jordan. But water was scarce there, and medical care was poor. Arab kept getting sick. The three sneaked out illegally, heading to a larger city and finding an apartment with relatives.

Close to two years later, the family was granted refugee status.

“They said, ‘We’ll send you to Michigan,’ ” Mr. Buteh said as the minivan driven by Mr. Aziz hurtled down the nearly empty highway. “They told us it’s very beautiful, with a large Middle Eastern community and jobs in car factories.”

About 2 a.m., the van delivered the family to its small motel, where a spread of tea, chicken, rice, apples and pickles awaited on a night stand.

Mr. Buteh stepped out into the deserted parking lot and rapidly smoked another cigarette. He patted the beige, puffy coat he was wearing and glanced upward.

“I was not expecting it to be warm,” he said. “I came here expecting snow.”",11849

She got the bit of body art after wrapping Clouds of Sils Maria, a Swiss-set surrealist flick helmed by French master Olivier Assayas and also starring Juliette Binoche. It’s one of three indie films that’s earned Stewart heavy acclaim on the festival circuit, along with her gripping turn as a daughter struggling to cope with her mother’s (Julianne Moore) deterioration from Alzheimer’s in Still Alice, for which she’ll receive a “major Oscar push” from distributor Sony Pictures Classics, and last but not least, as PFC Amy Cole, a green guard at Guantánamo in Camp X-Ray, in theaters Oct. 17.

In Camp X-Ray, her guard is initially happy to serve her country in the wake of 9/11, but after observing the treatment of the prisoners there, and striking up an unlikely friendship with one of the detainees (Peyman Maadi, A Separation), she begins to have a change of heart.

After ordering coffee, we discuss her resurgence.

Camp X-Ray was shot on a shoestring budget of $1 million, but it looks much bigger than that.

It’s weird to say that the scope of it is pretty small considering what you see, but if you think about it, we had essentially three locations and shot it in 20 days. The key to the budget is it was so fast and we just gunned it.

It had been two years since you shot your last film, Snow White and the Huntsman. Were you being extra picky in the wake of Twilight because you knew you were under the microscope?

I’m never really that precious about choosing projects that don’t have every sure element that is a guaranteed good experience and/or success. There’s a lot of risk involved in this job, and it doesn’t bother me. This could’ve been a terrible movie! It could’ve been awful. It’s with a first-time director. But I still would’ve gotten what I got out of it had the movie not turned out as well as it did.

You tend to take those leaps. I remember Leonardo DiCaprio once saying that he has a policy of never working with first-time directors.

It’s smart. I’ve had experiences that have made me go, “Ugh, I have to be careful and make sure that every part is sturdy and that I won’t be let down.” If I was a director, I would be extremely conscious of my filmography. It says so much about the difference between putting your name on something and owning it instead of being one tiny part of it. Actors get to work all the time. If I make a bad movie every once in a while, I don’t care. I didn’t work after Snow White for about two years, but it’s because a lot of these projects didn’t come together. I’m decisive, but I’m definitely not a planner.

I have these talks with friends, and I’ll say, “Kristen Stewart’s a good actress,” and they disagree. Then I ask them what films they’ve seen of yours, and they just say, “The Twilight movies.” So, they haven’t seen, say, Panic Room, Speak, Into the Wild, Adventureland, etc. Do you feel like that series has unfairly colored people’s opinions of your acting ability?

Honestly, I don’t care. It’s fine. I’m really happy doing what I’m doing. I’m sure there are a ton of people out there who would hate my movies even if they saw all those, just as I’m sure there are people out there who are obsessed with Twilight and say, “I watched the series, and she completely let me down, and then I watched every one of her other movies, and I fuckin’ hate her!” And that’s cool! Just don’t watch my movies.

With Camp X-Ray, this is pretty heavy subject matter here in Gitmo. President Obama promised to close the place down in 2009, but hasn’t done so yet. Was part of the attraction to the project shining a light in this bizarre blight on America?

I was forced to really investigate. I knew that Obama wanted to close it down, and I knew that everyone else wanted to, too. Most people you talk to in America have kind of put it out of their minds. I didn’t jump on this movie to make a huge political statement, but it’s such an interesting story within an interesting context, and it’s more of a poke on the shoulder to remind you that this thing is here.

Your character’s relationship with Peyman’s detainee reminds us of the humanity of these people. We tend to view suspected terrorists as this nameless, faceless “other,” when they’re human beings, too.

As Americans, we should absolutely aspire to more than that. If you label something “bad,” people will justify the most terrible things. Just because you’re following a greater whole, suddenly you take the individual out of it and no one bears responsibility for anything.

The film doesn’t show any of the more controversial practices at Gitmo—like waterboarding, sleep deprivation, force-feeding, etc. It alludes to it. But if we showed all that stuff, people would instantly demonize the film. You see something like that and it becomes so polarizing. Yes, it was cool to be in a Gitmo movie, it was cool to play a soldier, and it was cool remind people that this still exists, but I also thought it was cool to play a simple, American girl who wanted to find her line and aspire to something bigger than her—only to find that things aren’t so simple. Most people in every state think, “Well, of course it’s a great thing to sign up for the Army,” and there’s no question asked beyond that—ever.

She really gets swept up in all the post 9/11 patriotism and signs up for Gitmo duty, only to find that it isn’t what she thought at all.

She’s simple, not very smart, and really socially inadequate—but a good person. So, if you can sign up, put a uniform on, and erase yourself, you don’t have to consider yourself anymore. You can take the individual out of it and say, “Well, this dignifies me. I’m good because of this.” And when that doesn’t end up being true, you actually have to contend with who you are. All she wants is to think, “They did 9/11, they’re bad, fuck that, I’m going to do my job and I’m going to do it well.” But then she gets down there and just can’t accept it; she can’t conform to that.

Right. The mistake we make is not viewing these detainees down there as people, too. We’re all people.

That is essentially so fucking evil, it’s crazy. It’s a ridiculous idea for you to think that you know anything for sure in life—other than to take care of your fellow people. Where the fuck do you get off thinking otherwise? These two people couldn’t be from more different worlds and perspectives, and probably disagree fundamentally on most things, but there’s a through-line for all of us—and that’s what people forget, and that’s what makes people capable of doing terrible things to each other. What makes you different from any other person that walks the earth?

This is a pretty ripped-from-the-headlines film. What issues are you passionate about in the news?

I don’t want to talk about that shit at all. Trust me, I’m only asking for it. When it comes time to stand up and affect change, I’m not the type of person to shout from the rooftops. Just because you’re an actor and in the public eye, people think that’s how you must be. But there are other ways to do that. That’s not me.

When you talk about Camp X-Ray, Still Alice, and Clouds of Sils Maria, these are three films anchored by strong, flawed, complex women. These films tend to be a rarity in Hollywood, and usually come in smaller indie packages.

Me and Juliette [Binoche] were talking about it because this question does come up, and she said, “Oh, I don’t answer that question anymore. It’s so cliché.” And I said, “Well, it’s so cliché because it’s entirely true.” And she said, “Yes, maybe in Hollywood.” Because in France, due to the history of French directors having romantic relationships with their lead actresses, they tend to tell more female-centric stories. In America, there are way more male filmmakers than female ones, and they want to tell more masculine stories. Most of our great films that we’re proud of, you’ve got Bob De Niro, Jack Nicholson, and the bravado is overwhelming. And that’s still going on. I read a million scripts and people say I choose my scripts carefully, but it’s just so obvious when the role is different, and complex, and not some typical, archetypal girl, because they’re so rare. Not to sound cliché, but it’s a male-dominated and driven business.

“It’s A Man’s World,” to quote James Brown.

[Laughs] Yeah. But that’s OK, because it’s fun to be the underdog.

There just needs to be more female filmmakers.

Exactly! That’s it. I’ll do it.

A case study would be your Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke. This is a very accomplished filmmaker and, five years after directing that hit, her latest film basically went straight-to-video. That has to be indicative of a larger problem within the industry, that she was basically given one Red Riding Hood before her power was stripped away. A male director is given a lot more chances.

Yeah, that’s true. That’s a thing that women have to do—you must persevere. That’s what we’ve been doing. You need to make something that’s undeniably good. If a woman makes a bad movie, or does something stupid, then the door just slams shut. It’s fucked up.

A lot of young actresses these days are coming out against being labeled a feminist. It seems to be a generational thing, where people from the older generation see it for its definition—equality for men and women—while the younger generation for some reason views it as a more divisive term.

I know what you mean. That’s such a strange thing to say, isn’t it? Like, what do you mean? Do you not believe in equality for men and women? I think it’s a response to overly-aggressive types. There are a lot of women who feel persecuted and go on about it, and I sometimes am like, “Honestly, just relax, because now you’re going in the other direction.” Sometimes, the loudest voice in the room isn’t necessarily the one you should listen to. By our nature alone, think about what you’re saying and say it—but don’t scream in people’s faces, because then you’re discrediting us.Relating it to my one little avenue, people say, “If you want to make it in the film industry as a woman, you have to be a bitch.” No, you are going to ruin any chance you have and give us a bad name. It’s the overcompensation to where our generation goes, “Relax,” because it’s been easier for us, and because we don’t have as much of the anger, so it’s like we can’t get behind it and it’s a bit embarrassing. But that being said, it’s a really ridiculous thing to say you’re not a feminist.",11781

During an address to the nation, Prime Minster Stephen Harper said the incident in Ottawa was a 'terrorist' act. Mr. Harper also indicated that it remains unclear whether the man shot dead on Parliament Hill Wednesday acted alone.

""Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us.""

The Prime Minister concluded by stating that there will be no safe haven for terrorists and expressed confidence that Canadians will pull together in the wake of this week's events.

Federal sources have identified the suspected shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a man in his early 30s who was known to Canadian authorities.

Sources told The Globe and Mail he was recently unable to secure travel documentation he was seeking, thus blocking his attempt to travel abroad. The circumstances are similar to that surrounding the case of Martin Rouleau-Couture, the Quebecker who was shot Monday after running down two Canadian Forces soldiers with his car.

Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in 1982 and was the son of Bulgasem Zehaf, a Quebec businessman who appears to have fought in 2011 in Libya, and Susan Bibeau, the deputy chairperson of a division of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board.

Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau has a record in Quebec in the early 2000s for petty crimes such as possession of drugs, credit-card forgery and robbery. He was also charged with robbery in 2011 in Vancouver.

""We're still in the process of an active operation right now. We're treating this very seriously with the RCMP in identifying and clearing Parliament Hill to render it safe,"" Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau told a mid-afternoon media briefing.

Shortly after 8:30 p.m. (ET) Ottawa police lifted the lockdown in the city's downtown core saying that the threat to public safety no longer remained.

However, the police operation on Parliament Hill is still ongoing and remains off limits to the public.

Asked if the attack had caught police off guard, Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the RCMP's national division, said: ""I think that from our reaction, it caught us by surprise.""

Still, he said ""all available and necessary resources were activated and deployed immediately"" and will remain in place as long as necessary.

Canadian Armed Forces personnel, at least in the Ottawa area, are being instructed not to wear their uniform in public unless on duty, a source said.

A Forces directive to this effect will go out shortly, the source said.

THE SHOOTING: FEDERAL BUILDINGS PUT INTO LOCKDOWN

Gunfire erupted at the National War Memorial around 9:52 a.m. (ET), then moved to Parliament Hill's Centre Block. The Parliament Hill shooting was captured on this video by a Globe reporter. One Parliament Hill guard was shot in the leg, treated in hospital and was later released.

The outbreak of violence sent MPs into hiding and all federal government buildings into lockdown, which wasn't lifted until late on Wednesday evening.

Mr. Harper was with Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino in a caucus meeting when the gunfire began, Mr. Fantino told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. Fantino credits a sergeant-at-arms for taking down a gunman. ""All the details are not in but the sergeant-at-arms, a former Mountie, is the one that engaged the gunman, or one of them at least, and stopped this,"" Fantino said.

Mr. Fantino also praised the RCMP for protecting the Prime Minister and other parliamentarians. ""They were so professional,"" he told the Toronto Sun of the RCMP. ""Incredible.""

Mr. Harper met with cabinet concerning Wednesday's attack before addressing the nation in a statement.

THE LOCKDOWN: OTTAWANS WARNED TO STAY CLEAR OF DOWNTOWN

Earlier in the day Parliament Hill staff were issued a security warning to stay away from doors and windows, lock their doors and, if doors would not lock, to barricade them. ""Do not open a door under any circumstances,"" the security alert said.

Public building close to Parliament buildings had also established lockdowns, including the University of Ottawa, where personnel went door to door to tell people to stay put. Schools in the downtown core were also locked down. However, by early afternoon, students and faculty at the University of Ottawa were no longer fully respecting the lockdown and had started to leave campus.

The Rideau Centre mall, a major shopping centre a block from the war memorial, was also in lockdown after police initially reported shots being fired nearby. However, the police later said that no shots were fired near the mall.

THE WAR MEMORIAL: 'MOVE DOWN! THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER!'

Police officers at the cenotaph, which was cordoned with yellow tape and bordered by cruisers, ordered bystanders and journalists to move farther away from the crime scene on Wednesday morning, toward the Rideau Centre mall.

Tensions ran high as the officers yelled at journalists to get back around 10:30 a.m. (ET), with one officer shouting: "" Move down! There's an active shooter! If you want to die, stay here. If you want to live, keep moving!""

Liberal MP John McKay said he was just taking off his jacket about to go into the caucus room when he heard ""Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!"" He assumed the sounds were construction noise, but then security guards rushed down the halls ordering everybody out.

Mr. McKay said the MPs followed security out the back door and then they ""huddled out back by the monuments"" for a while. ""That building is the people's building ... I'd hate to think of us shutting it down because of both paranoia and legitimate fears.""

A tourist from the Netherlands, Jan Lugtenborg, told reporters that a man with a long rifle was ""running like hell that way... to Parliament Hill.""

""We didn't expect this in Canada,"" he said.

EYEWITNESS: 'IT SOUNDED LIKE A SHOTGUN'

One man watched the scene unfold from a third-floor office that faces the war memorial. ""It was unreal,"" said the witness, who asked not to be identified. ""I heard the shot and looked out the window. . . The shooter came from the west side and aimed right at the young guy that was standing guard and shot him twice. I think he missed with the first shot; it sounded like a shotgun.""

He saw the young soldier fall. No one returned fire. Other guards and police converged on the victim. The scene was ""mayhem,"" he said.

Major-General Christopher Coates, deputy commander continental at Canadian Joint Operations Command, extended condolences to the member's family.

""Canadian armed forces bases and establishments are currently taking precautions appropriate to their environment to ensure the safety and security of personnel and infrastructure,"" he said.

THE CHATEAU LAURIER: GERMAN DELEGATION SAW DRAMA UNFOLD

Carol Devine, owner of Devine Fine Jewellery on the hotel's main floor, says people are being told they can't leave. ""It's really weird. I feel the same today as I did on Sept 11 [2001],"" she said. ""I was working that day here, there were people stuck here from the U.S. and security on Parliament Hill. It's the same kind of weird feeling.""

Richard Teltschik is leading a delegation of German parliamentarians from the Christian Social Union of Bavaria on a visit to Ottawa, and left the Chateau Laurier as the Parliament Hill drama was unfolding.

""There was police coming from all sides, from all the streets they are running towards the Parliament,"" he said in a phone call from the Museum of Canadian History, which is across the Ottawa River from the capital.

""We are all concerned and surprised that in quaint Canada, this kind of thing could happen,"" he said. ""Everybody expects Canada to be remote from all the troubles of the world, peaceful and quiet and now we have this situation.""

REACTION: 'OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THOSE INJURED'

In a televised address Wednesday evening, NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said Canada was shaken by the shootings but ""we shall not waver.""

""These acts were driven by hatred but also designed to drive us to hate,"" he said. ""They will not. We will stand up, and we will stand together. We will persevere and we will prevail.""

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday night that he was saddened by the shootings and condemns ""these brutal and heartless"" acts of violence.

Mr. Trudeau called for continued co-operation with Canada's Muslim community ""to help prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.""

Mr. Harper cancelled his planned trip to Toronto, where he was to present girls' education activist Malala Yousafzai with honorary Canadian citizenship on Wednesday afternoon.

Conservative MPs held a moment of silence after they were informed that the Canadian Armed Forces member passed away.

Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz postponed a planned 11:15 a.m. (ET) news conference in Ottawa, due to take place in the National Press theatre, across Wellington Street from Parliament Hill. The news conference was to follow Wednesday's release of the central bank's interest rate statement and monetary policy report.

Ottawa mayor Jim Watson called Wednesday a ""sad and tragic day for our city and our country.""

""I'm sure I speak for all residents of our city when I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of the individual who lost his life this morning while standing guard at the National War Memorial at the heart of downtown Ottawa.""

In Toronto, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne says she and the opposition leaders discussed suspending Question Period in light of the Ottawa shooting, but she says ""we refuse to be silenced.""

White House and other U.S. government officials have been in ""close touch"" with their Canadian counterparts ""to offer assistance"" and have asked to arrange a phone call between President Barack Obama and Mr. Harper at the Prime Minister's earliest convenience, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington.

Mrs Hufford was killed after Alton Nolen, who had just been fired from Vaughan Foods, allegedly walked into the food processing plant and attacked her with a large knife, severing her head.

Nolen then repeatedly stabbed 43-year-old Traci Johnson before he was shot by Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy and the company's chief operating officer, police said.

The suspect is set to be charged on Tuesday with first degree murder for the killing. He will also face a charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the stabbing of Ms Johnson.

Mrs Hufford, who had been married to her husband KC for 25 years, had only just recovered from the trauma of losing her family home in the devastating Moore tornado last year.

Her neighbors described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed.

Today, it was revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.

According to records, he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported.

He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011. Records show that due to plea agreements, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time.

He was released on March 22, 2013, the documents reveal.

'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said on Friday.

'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections.'

'If it's not an 85 percent crime, we have no idea how long a person will actually spend in prison.'

An FBI investigation into the incident is still pending, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told Fox News. it is not known whether the act was one of terror.

On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life.

Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity.

It also included a graphic photo of a beheading.

Nolen's family members have said that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them.

'I spoke to him once he was released, and when we spoke, there was nothing of the sort,' said Nolen's cousin, James Fulsom, from Fort Worth, Texas. 'I don't believe he was converted (to Islam) in prison.'

As recently as February, Fulsom said that when he talked to Nolen there was no mention of his conversion.

'He was just talking about what he was going to start doing, how he was going to get his life on track, and was ready to be focused on his future,' Fulsom told the Associated Press.

A spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Nolen had attended services at a mosque where sermons were delivered condemning such attacks.

'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' said Saad Mohammad, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City.

He added that he remembers the suspect was 'a little weird'.

'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags' since he began worshiping at one of the group's centers in May.

He also said that Nolen attended services where sermons were delivered against beheadings like those committed by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, militants, reports CBS News.

'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' Mohammed said.

Records show that Nolen has what appear to be religious tattoos, including one referencing Jesus and one in Arabic that means 'peace be with you.'

Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and that he then drove from the building that houses the company's human resources department to its main distribution center.

Once inside, he attacked Mrs Hufford with a knife in the center's administrative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police.

Nolen then repeatedly stabbed Ms Johnson, who was treated for her injuries at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center.

She was released on Saturday, said Varina Shellman, clinical coordinator for the medical center, before being reportedly interviewed by police.

Police learned Nolen was fired for 'numerous reasons' involving 'personnel issues,' Lewis said, adding that he didn't know the specifics.

Police asked the FBI to help investigate Nolen after co-workers told investigators he had recently started trying to convert several employees to Islam.

My son was raised up in a loving home. My son was raised up believing in God. Our hearts bleed right now because of what they're saying Alton has done Joyce Nolen

Lewis said police asked the FBI to look into Nolen's background because of the nature of the attack, which followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants.

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge James E. Finch said the motive for the attack had not been determined, but that there is no reason to believe there was a threat to anyone else.

'We don't have any reason to believe there is any danger to the area,' Lewis said.

Nolen's mother and sister posted a video message on Facebook over the weekend, saying they were shocked and saddened by the allegations against him.

'My son was raised up in a loving home. My son was raised up believing in God,' hi mother, Joyce Nolen, said in the video. 'Our hearts bleed right now because of what they're saying Alton has done.'

Neighbor Donna Myers said Colleen's husband KC had told her he was 'overwhelmed' by the tragedy but he was 'really grateful' for all the support he had received.

Mrs Myers told MailOnline: 'The family moved here about a year ago after losing everything in the tornado. They were just getting settled and seemed to be enjoying life again.

'They really enjoyed the pond out back and liked to feed the geese with Riley their granddaughter.

'Kelli was at the house a lot and her and Riley would stay over and meant the world to Colleen, it is such a tragedy.'

Mrs Myers, who works as a paramedic, said the Huffords were a normal family who enjoyed 'hanging out' together, fishing and going to church.

778299287293816832,unverified,Will NY AG investigate Clinton campaign credit card fraud re elderly donors? https://t.co/XtvJz9klmA https://t.co/lV6z7hJO5v,http://observer.com/2016/09/exclusive-hillary-clinton-campaign-systematically-overcharging-poorest-donors/,True,Exclusive: Hillary Clinton Campaign Systematically Overcharging Poorest Donors,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is stealing from her poorest supporters by purposefully and repeatedly overcharging them after they make what’s supposed to be a one-time small donation through her official campaign website, multiple sources tell the Observer.

The overcharges are occurring so often that the fraud department at one of the nation’s biggest banks receives up to 100 phone calls a day from Clinton’s small donors asking for refunds for unauthorized charges to their bankcards made by Clinton’s campaign. One elderly Clinton donor, who has been a victim of this fraud scheme, has filed a complaint with her state’s attorney general and a representative from the office told her that they had forwarded her case to the Federal Election Commission.

“We get up to a hundred calls a day from Hillary’s low-income supporters complaining about multiple unauthorized charges,” a source, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of job security, from the Wells Fargo fraud department told the Observer. The source claims that the Clinton campaign has been pulling this stunt since Spring of this year. The Hillary for America campaign will overcharge small donors by repeatedly charging small amounts such as $20 to the bankcards of donors who made a one-time donation. However, the Clinton campaign strategically doesn’t overcharge these donors $100 or more because the bank would then be obligated to investigate the fraud.

“We don’t investigate fraudulent charges unless they are over $100,” the fraud specialist explained. “The Clinton campaign knows this, that’s why we don’t see any charges over the $100 amount, they’ll stop the charges just below $100. We’ll see her campaign overcharge donors by $20, $40 or $60 but never more than $100.” The source, who has worked for Wells Fargo for over 10 years, said that the total amount they refund customers on a daily basis who have been overcharged by Clinton’s campaign “varies” but the bank usually issues refunds that total between $700 and $1,200 per day.

The fraud specialist said that Clinton donors who call in will attempt to resolve the issue with the campaign first but they never get anywhere. “They will call the Clinton campaign to get their refund and the issue never gets resolved. So they call us and we just issue the refund. The Clinton campaign knows these charges are small potatoes and that we’ll just refund the money back.”

The source said that pornography companies often deploy a similar arrangement pull. “We see this same scheme with a lot of seedy porn companies,” the source said. The source also notes that the dozens of phone calls his department receives daily are from people who notice the fraudulent charges on their statements. “The people who call us are just the ones who catch the fraudulent charges. I can’t imagine how many more people are getting overcharged by Hillary’s campaign and they have no idea.”

The source said he’s apolitical but noted that the bank’s fraud department is yet to receive one call from a Donald Trump supporter claiming to have been overcharged by Trump’s campaign. “I’m only talking to you because what Hillary’s doing is so messed up, she’s stealing from her poorest supporters.”

Wells Fargo recently came under fire after news broke that various regulators fined the big bank $185 million for opening 2 million phony customer accounts without their customers’ permission. This massive scandal resulted in the firing of 5,300 Wells Fargo employees.

Carol Mahre, an 81-year-old grandmother of seven from Minnesota, is one of the victims of Clinton’s campaign donor fraud scandal. In March, Mahre said she made a one-time $25 donation via Clinton’s official campaign website. However, when she received her U.S. Bank card statement, she noticed multiple $25 charges were made. Mahre, who said in an interview she only contributed $25 because she’s “not rich” and that’s all she could afford, contacted her son, Roger Mahre, to help her dispute the unauthorized charges.

Roger, who is an attorney, told the Observer that he called the Clinton campaign dozens of times in April and early May in an attempt to resolve the issue. “It took me at least 40 to 50 phone calls to the campaign office before I finally got ahold of someone,” Roger said. “After I got a campaign worker on the phone, she said they would stop making the charges.”

Incredibly, the very next day, Carol’s card was charged yet again and the campaign had never reversed the initial fraudulent charges. “I was told they would stop charging my mother’s card but they never stopped.” He added that he knows his mother did not sign up for recurring payments. “She’s very good with the internet so I know she only made a one-time payment.” Roger also pointed out that even if his mother mistakenly signed up for recurring monthly payments then she should’ve been charged for the same amount of money each month, not multiple charges for varying amounts on the same day or in the same month. Furthermore, Roger said that after the campaign was made aware of this situation, the charges should’ve stopped but they never did.

The Clinton campaign overcharged Carol $25 three times and then overcharged her one time for $19, a grand total of $94 in fraudulent charges. The campaign’s overcharges to Carol were just a few dollars short of $100. This is in line with what the Wells Fargo bank source revealed to the Observer.

Since the campaign failed to amend the problem for Carol, Roger contacted her bank, U.S. Bank. However, he ran into problems when he asked U.S. Bank to refund his mother’s money. Roger told the Observer that the bank would not reverse the charges and that a bank spokesperson told him that they had no control over companies that make unauthorized charges. At that point, Roger decided to contact his local news and filed a fraud complaint with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson’s office on behalf of his mother. After local TV news Kare 11 ran a story, someone from U.S. Bank contacted Roger the next day and said that they had reversed and stopped the charges to his mother’s card.

A representative from Minnesota’s Democratic attorney general’s office told Roger that this problem wasn’t in their jurisdiction and that they had forwarded the case to the FEC. However, FEC spokesperson Julia Queen told the Observer they have no record of the case. “We don’t have it,” Queen said. The Observer contacted Swanson’s office and did not hear back.

Roger did eventually get a letter from a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign. In the letter, the lawyer wrote that his mother would be removed from their donor list; however, the campaign did not take any responsibility for the fraudulent charges.

“They basically said that they weren’t accepting responsibility for this but they’d remove my mom from the donor list,” he said. Roger is less than happy with the way the Clinton campaign has handled this nightmare for him and his mother. “This is a load of crap!” Mahre said. “The self-righteousness of politicians drives me insane. If you and I did this, we’d be thrown in jail. This is theft, fraud or wire fraud—it’s a federal crime!”

Since Carol’s story became public, Roger said he’s heard from other people who have been ripped off by the Clinton campaign. “I’ve heard this is happening to other small donors,” Roger said. “People will donate $25, but then when they receive their credit card statement, they are charged $25 multiple times.”

The incident hasn’t just left a bad taste in Roger’s mouth. Carol decided she’s not going to vote for Hillary even though she’s voted for the Democratic presidential nominee every election since President Dwight Eisenhower won reelection in 1956. “My mother is a lifelong Democrat and she’s voted every election in her life for a Democrat but she’s not going to vote for Hillary,” Roger said.

The New York Times reported in 2007 that Clinton’s first presidential campaign had to refund and subtract hundreds of thousands of dollars from its first-quarter total often because donors’ credit cards were charged twice. Additionally, it was reported that Clinton had to refund a stunning $2.8 million in donations, three times more than the $900K President Barack Obama’s campaign refunded.

Another bank source told the Observer that Clinton’s motivation in purposefully overcharging donors is not only to rake in more money for her campaign but also to inflate her small donor numbers reported to the FEC. “This gives a false impression about how much money Clinton has raised,” the source said. “The money that the bank has refunded would not be reflected in the FEC filings till after the election. This gives off the illusion to the public that her support and the amount she’s raised is much greater than what it is in reality.”

A Clinton campaign worker named Kathy Callahan, who worked on Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, claimed in a blog post that Clinton fraudulently overcharged her by several thousand dollars. She wrote that she voluntarily left the campaign’s finance committee after she discovered $3,000 in unauthorized charges made by Clinton’s campaign to her Visa card. Callahan said the unauthorized charges caused $400 in overdraft and bank charges and put Callahan over the legal donor limit. Callahan said that after a month of “begging and pleading,” she wasn’t able to get her money back until she threatened to go to authorities. However, when she was finally refunded her money the Clinton campaign refused to compensate her for the $400 in overdraft and bank charges.

Callahan also wrote that Matt McQueeney, who worked in the compliance and accounting department at Clinton’s campaign headquarters at the time, told her, “What happened to you with credit card errors is happening to others.” McQueeney reportedly parted ways with the Clinton campaign shortly after this incident occurred. Backing up what McQueeney claimed, there were several incidents similar to Callahan’s reported in 2008. Callahan and McQueeney could not be reached for comment.

In 2001, the Clintons were accused of attempting to steal items donated to the White House during Bill’s presidency as he exited office. There was $190,000 worth of gifts in question that the Clintons shipped to their then new estate in Chappaqua, New York. Multiple donors said that they had understood that the items they had donated during Clinton’s presidency were to stay in the White House as part of the 1993 White House redecoration project. Initially, the Clintons claimed that the items in question were given to them prior to President Clinton taking office; however, government records proved otherwise. Facing strong criticism, the Clintons decided to return several items including $28,500 in furnishings and they paid $86,000 for other gifts.

Murmurs of theft are nothing new to the Clintons. But Bill begs to differ.

He recently compared himself to Robin Hood and said that through their foundation he asks people with money to give to people who don’t have money. In reality, the Clintons steal from people who have little money and they’re robbing some of Hillary’s most impoverished supporters—including a poor elderly grandma—to fund her campaign.

A day after the 24-year-old Canadian reservist and single dad was gunned down in Ottawa on Wednesday, his forlorn dogs could be seen peering out from his family's home in Hamilton, Ontario.

Cirillo was devoted to his animals, posting image after image of him grinning beside them to his Instagram feed. Friends also recounted the story of him recently finding an abandoned, emaciated puppy that he nursed back to heath and then re-homed.

'Found him a pretty home, hope he has a good life,' Cirillo wrote just four weeks ago of the pup.

Where is he? Heartbreaking images show dogs peeking out from beneath Corporal Nathan Cirillo's family home on Thursday, a day after he was shot dead outside the Parliament

Forlorn: The two dogs peeked out from beneath the fence at the family's home in Hamilton, Ontario

Missed: Cirillo had two German shepherd-type dogs and recently nursed an abandoned puppy to health

Cirillo, who was shot dead as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament on Wednesday, also leaves behind a six-year-old son.

He was bringing up the boy, Marcus, alone - with help from his mother, Kathy - after the boy's mother was no longer in the picture, friends have said.

Former girlfriend Randi Lotsberg said that Cirillo lit up whenever he spoke about his son.

'He stepped up. Definitely admirable,' she told The Star. 'I feel so bad right now for his kid. Now his son doesn't have a dad.'

Tragic: The animal-loving Hamilton, Ontario native was shot at close range and rushed to a nearby hospital

Family: Cirillo leaves behind his two dogs and his six-year-old son Marcus, left, who he was bringing up alone

Waiting: Cirillo's son is now expected to stay with his mother, Kathy, who has helped with his care

He met the boy's mother, Kendra, at the Ancaster Fair in Jerseyville after he was kicked out for not paying to get in. Outside he met Kendra and a friend, who asked for a ride home,Metro News reported. They dated and went on to have Marcus.

Cirillo's mother Kathy, who is traveling to Ottawa, will now likely take care of Marcus, CBC reported. She took care of him when Cirillo was working or away on his military duties, Lotsberg said.

Nathan's uncle Jim Cirillo told reporters from a home in Hamilton that the soldier's mother is in total shock.

'She's saying she doesn't believe it,' he told CBC. 'She went on the internet and she saw it and she...I don't know how she didn't pass out. She's just completely broken, broken right now.'

Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina said that he had visited a makeshift memorial to Cirillo outside his regiment's barracks before going to the family's home with Police Chief Glenn De Caire.

As he spoke to the slain soldier's relatives, little Marcus wandered out to greet everyone. He likely didn't understand what had just happened, the mayor said.

Ominous: Responders frantically tried reviving Cirillo at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

'At what point does a five-year-old actually understand that?' Bratina asked.

Cirillo had dreamed of serving his country since he was a teenager. He became a cadet when he was just 13 and joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders about five years ago.

Friends said he loved country music and was a fitness fanatic who had worked as a personal trainer.

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

'He always had a smile on his face,' his friend Peter DiBussolo told The Ottawa Citizen. 'He was always walking around giving people handshakes, introducing people to himself.'

Manager Billy Pozeg of Club Absinthe, where Cirillo worked as a bouncer, told CBC Cirillo often showed up straight from the armury in his fatigues.

No matter how tired he was from back-to-back shifts, he lifted the mood of every room he entered, Pozeg said.

Last photos: This image of a happy Cirillo was taken by a tourist in the days before his death

On a Facebook memorial page, set up just hours after Cirillo's death, friends and loved ones recounted stories of his kindness.

One described an incident where she had traveled to Hamilton for a night out with friends but they were unable to meet her - but Cirillo was there.

'Nathan stayed in downtown after he had finished with the army and waited for me even though it was snowing and well below 0C and my bus was over an hour late,' Megan Newman wrote.

'He stood at the station and waited and took me home, he even had a coffee in his hand for me. He was a true stand-up guy, who lived for his son and family also the military. He will be a big miss.'

Family members said they found out Cirillo was the victim after seeing footage on the news.

'When I saw the ambulance take him in and I saw his receding hairline, I knew it was my nephew,' an unidentified aunt told the Globe and Mail.

On Wednesday, he was photographed by a Parliament Hill visitor standing by the Tomb mere moments before the attack.

The Hamilton, Ontario native served Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada. That regiment is one of the country's largest army reserve units in Canada and guarding the National War Memorial is part soldiers' ceremonial duties.

Saddened: Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen also paid their respects on Thursday by leaving flowers at the site where the soldier was gunned down

We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

The reservists are rotated on an hourly or bi-hourly basis, and it could have been any of the men -- some part-time and others full -- who served the duty on Parliament Hill Wednesday in their Black Watch tartan kilt, Glengarry and other regimental garb. But the fate befell Cirillo.

Many of his closest friends were in his regiment, including Brendan Stevenson, who was believed to be standing beside him at the grave of the unknown soldier when he was shot, according to Maclean's.

Seconds later after the photo was taken, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo, whose ceremonial weapon was not loaded. The soldier was rushed to a hospital, but soon succumbed to the wounds.

Twitter user Kamakazi19982 posted the photo with the caption: 'Ok so we were on a tour at the war monument in Ottawa a few minutes ago, a few seconds later there was a shooting.'

The horror began when a masked Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed Cirillo standing guard at Canada's war memorial Wednesday, then stormed Parliament in an attack that was stopped cold when he was shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms.

Another constable Samearn Son was shot in the leg but is expected to make a full recovery.

Canada's prime minister called it the country's second terrorist attack in three days.

The country was already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run assault Monday against two Canadian soldiers by a man Harper described as an 'ISIS-inspired terrorist.'

Gunned down: He had been in Ottawa because members of the Argylls were standing guard this week

Loss: 24-year-old Carillo served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton, Ontario

Friends described Cirillo as a fitness fanatic. The 24-year-old worked part-time as a personal trainer as well as a bouncer at a Hamilton nightclub

One soldier was killed in the first attack.

'We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,' Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed in an address to the nation.

Investigators offered little information about the gunman but he is the son of Susan Bibeau who works for the Immigration and Refuge Board of Canada.

On Thursday, Ms Bibeau spoke from her home to apologize for her son's actions.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow.'

'We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.'

On Thursday, sergeant-in-arms Kevin Vickers was given a hero's welcome to parliament with a standing ovation from politicians across the political spectrum.

A day after the 24-year-old Canadian reservist and single dad was gunned down in Ottawa on Wednesday, his forlorn dogs could be seen peering out from his family's home in Hamilton, Ontario.

Cirillo was devoted to his animals, posting image after image of him grinning beside them to his Instagram feed. Friends also recounted the story of him recently finding an abandoned, emaciated puppy that he nursed back to heath and then re-homed.

'Found him a pretty home, hope he has a good life,' Cirillo wrote just four weeks ago of the pup.

Where is he? Heartbreaking images show dogs peeking out from beneath Corporal Nathan Cirillo's family home on Thursday, a day after he was shot dead outside the Parliament

Forlorn: The two dogs peeked out from beneath the fence at the family's home in Hamilton, Ontario

Missed: Cirillo had two German shepherd-type dogs and recently nursed an abandoned puppy to health

Cirillo, who was shot dead as he stood guard at the National War Memorial outside the Canadian Parliament on Wednesday, also leaves behind a six-year-old son.

He was bringing up the boy, Marcus, alone - with help from his mother, Kathy - after the boy's mother was no longer in the picture, friends have said.

Former girlfriend Randi Lotsberg said that Cirillo lit up whenever he spoke about his son.

'He stepped up. Definitely admirable,' she told The Star. 'I feel so bad right now for his kid. Now his son doesn't have a dad.'

Tragic: The animal-loving Hamilton, Ontario native was shot at close range and rushed to a nearby hospital

Family: Cirillo leaves behind his two dogs and his six-year-old son Marcus, left, who he was bringing up alone

Waiting: Cirillo's son is now expected to stay with his mother, Kathy, who has helped with his care

He met the boy's mother, Kendra, at the Ancaster Fair in Jerseyville after he was kicked out for not paying to get in. Outside he met Kendra and a friend, who asked for a ride home,Metro News reported. They dated and went on to have Marcus.

Cirillo's mother Kathy, who is traveling to Ottawa, will now likely take care of Marcus, CBC reported. She took care of him when Cirillo was working or away on his military duties, Lotsberg said.

Nathan's uncle Jim Cirillo told reporters from a home in Hamilton that the soldier's mother is in total shock.

'She's saying she doesn't believe it,' he told CBC. 'She went on the internet and she saw it and she...I don't know how she didn't pass out. She's just completely broken, broken right now.'

Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina said that he had visited a makeshift memorial to Cirillo outside his regiment's barracks before going to the family's home with Police Chief Glenn De Caire.

As he spoke to the slain soldier's relatives, little Marcus wandered out to greet everyone. He likely didn't understand what had just happened, the mayor said.

Ominous: Responders frantically tried reviving Cirillo at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

'At what point does a five-year-old actually understand that?' Bratina asked.

Cirillo had dreamed of serving his country since he was a teenager. He became a cadet when he was just 13 and joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders about five years ago.

Friends said he loved country music and was a fitness fanatic who had worked as a personal trainer.

'Nathan was a good man,' friend Marie Michele told CBC News. 'He would give anything to anyone.'

'He always had a smile on his face,' his friend Peter DiBussolo told The Ottawa Citizen. 'He was always walking around giving people handshakes, introducing people to himself.'

Manager Billy Pozeg of Club Absinthe, where Cirillo worked as a bouncer, told CBC Cirillo often showed up straight from the armury in his fatigues.

No matter how tired he was from back-to-back shifts, he lifted the mood of every room he entered, Pozeg said.

Last photos: This image of a happy Cirillo was taken by a tourist in the days before his death

On a Facebook memorial page, set up just hours after Cirillo's death, friends and loved ones recounted stories of his kindness.

One described an incident where she had traveled to Hamilton for a night out with friends but they were unable to meet her - but Cirillo was there.

'Nathan stayed in downtown after he had finished with the army and waited for me even though it was snowing and well below 0C and my bus was over an hour late,' Megan Newman wrote.

'He stood at the station and waited and took me home, he even had a coffee in his hand for me. He was a true stand-up guy, who lived for his son and family also the military. He will be a big miss.'

Family members said they found out Cirillo was the victim after seeing footage on the news.

'When I saw the ambulance take him in and I saw his receding hairline, I knew it was my nephew,' an unidentified aunt told the Globe and Mail.

On Wednesday, he was photographed by a Parliament Hill visitor standing by the Tomb mere moments before the attack.

The Hamilton, Ontario native served Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada. That regiment is one of the country's largest army reserve units in Canada and guarding the National War Memorial is part soldiers' ceremonial duties.

Saddened: Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen also paid their respects on Thursday by leaving flowers at the site where the soldier was gunned down

Remembered: Flowers with a card sit at the foot of the War Memorial in Ottawa on Thursday

'I AM MAD AT OUR SON': TERRORIST'S MOTHER SPEAKS OUT 'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

The reservists are rotated on an hourly or bi-hourly basis, and it could have been any of the men -- some part-time and others full -- who served the duty on Parliament Hill Wednesday in their Black Watch tartan kilt, Glengarry and other regimental garb. But the fate befell Cirillo.

Many of his closest friends were in his regiment, including Brendan Stevenson, who was believed to be standing beside him at the grave of the unknown soldier when he was shot, according to Maclean's.

Seconds later after the photo was taken, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo, whose ceremonial weapon was not loaded. The soldier was rushed to a hospital, but soon succumbed to the wounds.

Twitter user Kamakazi19982 posted the photo with the caption: 'Ok so we were on a tour at the war monument in Ottawa a few minutes ago, a few seconds later there was a shooting.'

The horror began when a masked Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed Cirillo standing guard at Canada's war memorial Wednesday, then stormed Parliament in an attack that was stopped cold when he was shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms.

Another constable Samearn Son was shot in the leg but is expected to make a full recovery.

Canada's prime minister called it the country's second terrorist attack in three days.

The country was already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run assault Monday against two Canadian soldiers by a man Harper described as an 'ISIS-inspired terrorist.'

Gunned down: He had been in Ottawa because members of the Argylls were standing guard this week

Loss: 24-year-old Carillo served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Hamilton, Ontario

Friends described Cirillo as a fitness fanatic. The 24-year-old worked part-time as a personal trainer as well as a bouncer at a Hamilton nightclub

One soldier was killed in the first attack.

'We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,' Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed in an address to the nation.

Investigators offered little information about the gunman but he is the son of Susan Bibeau who works for the Immigration and Refuge Board of Canada.

On Thursday, Ms Bibeau spoke from her home to apologize for her son's actions.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow.'

'We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.'

On Thursday, sergeant-in-arms Kevin Vickers was given a hero's welcome to parliament with a standing ovation from politicians across the political spectrum.

693921710383337472,non-rumor,A conversation with X Japan’s Yoshiki and documentarian Stephen Kijak https://t.co/WZPohXYKgQ https://t.co/0urExAcC4f,http://www.newsweek.com/conversation-x-japans-yoshiki-and-documentarian-stephen-kijak-421500,True,A Conversation With X Japan’s Yoshiki and Documentarian Stephen Kijak,"The harrowing tale of the extraordinary X Japan, one of the most defiant musical groups in Japan’s history, resembles the stuff of soap operas. There’s drama abounding, cult brainwashing, tragedy and, of course, passion—all doused with hair dye, safety pins and heavy metal for good measure.

After forming in 1982, the band had a fraught, dazzling life until the death of a band member, Hide, and the increasing paranoia of Toshi, who had joined a cult, effectively caused the band to break up in 1998.

Oddly, X Japan found a new life through the Internet, arguably becoming more popular when inactive than when active. That led vocalist Toshi, drummer and pianist Yoshiki, bassist Heath and the guitarists Pata and Sugizo to resurrect the band 10 years later, and they’re currently wrapping up recording on their first album in 20 years.

Fans and industry folks lucky enough to catch the Sundance premiere of Stephen Kijak’s moving new documentary about the bands, We Are X, got to relive the tale with the very people who helped spawn the “visual kei” movement in Japan. The documentary spans the time leading up to the band’s inception in the early 1980s to its contemporary struggle to find recognition outside of Japan to preparing for a run of Madison Square Garden shows in October 2014. But it’s much more than your prototypical documentary about music featuring concert footage and archival videos: It’s a tale of survival, as told through the eyes of the charismatic Yoshiki, whose life has been documented behind the scenes for decades.

We caught up with Yoshiki and Kijak at Sundance to talk about the documentary, which just snagged a special jury award for editing.

How did this project catalyze? Were you a fan of X Japan before?

Kijak: I have a great relationship with Passion Pictures; we did Stones in Exile, and we did a film about Jaco Pastorius—well, at least we started one, long story. But we’ve always wanted to work together again. We have a great working relationship and they’re great producers. But I’m the music guy, so every time a music story comes his way, they tend to call me. So that’s how this happened. And sometimes it’s a no, I don’t have any interest.

See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows

But this one sparked my interest like nothing else has. I was compelled instantly when I started doing some research. It felt like a really great story to tell. There’s a lot of potential, not just narratively but visually. If you see X in the early days, you cannot believe your eyes. It’s so energetic and exciting, it was like discovering another world.

How did you two first meet?

Yoshiki: So my agent is Mark Geiger. We’ve been talking about X Japan’s future and position outside of Japan. And he has been telling me we have a crazy history, so why don’t you make a film? And I said it’s too hard for me to open that door. But he convinced me, so then introduced us to the producer. And he strongly recommended Stephen. And as soon as I met Stephen, there was kind of like a chemistry.

Kijak: We’re both children of David Bowie, in a way. And Toshi and I, the first albums we bought were KISS’s Lovegun. So you find this common ground you’d never expect. So we liked a lot of the same music and were from the same generation. We had similar heroes in music. And that pulled me into their music.

Yoshiki: We get a lot of ‘80s hair metal rock but we have a lot of punk, so much Sex Pistols.

Kijak: Sometimes I look at Hide’s looks and it’s like Siouxsie and the Banshees. There’s a goth and flamboyance that’s different to hair metal and way cooler.

Yoshiki: Very different. We didn’t know the hair metal thing actually. It was our own thing.

Something I loved in the movie is that you just posited these images and styles as such, instead of trying to make a finer point about masculinity and performance.

Kijak: Thank you. And it’s interesting, because from a Western perspective you see these costumes and looks and you’re going to have questions about androgyny, sexuality. Is it drag, is it costume? Culturally it’s not that at all. It’s something very different. It grew out of a love of punk and new wave. It was more of a social statement, right? It seemed to be a way to kick open a door to a new way of being in Japan.

Yoshiki: When I was 18, 19, I had hair dyed blonde. And I couldn’t get a cab. Cabs wouldn’t stop because they’d go, “Who are they?” Also very no-no to dye hair like that. Now, people have pink, purple and red hair all over Japan. And we kind of contributed to changing that culturally.

Kijak: It really was much more than that. To dye your hair blonde was to stick your middle finger up at society, because you just don’t do that. But in the West, “Oh he’s a punk, whatever, his parents might roll their eyes at him but in a few years he’ll be normal again.” Culturally it was a seismic shift.

Yoshiki, you said you were convinced to do this project? What reservations did you have before agreeing to it?

Yoshiki: Because the history’s very sad. Painful. You know, I mean, I knew my father had committed suicide. And my band member died. But sometimes I don’t even want to talk about it. But creating the film, it’s going to be reminding me of it in a hard way. So it’s going to hit me. During yesterday’s premiere, I cried 10 times in 90 minutes. But the tears I shed were not that bad, actually. It was kind of cleansing.

Was it cathartic to revisit this?

Yoshiki: It’s something like you don’t want to touch, that subject. But I touched it, and can move forward even stronger. It’s not a normal music documentary…

Kijak: I think one of the first things you said to me was that you wanted people to cry at the end. But it’s more about catharsis.

Yoshiki: I wanted to grab people’s hearts.

Kijak: Yes. So we had to try and get you there in the film.

Yoshiki: One more thing I asked Stephen was just because our history is very dark and sad, but to make it positive.

Kijak: And it’s not a false sense of triumph like, “Yay they played Madison Square Garden!” It is like a story of rebirth and survival. Seeing how the fans react to the music, it’s more than fandom. It’s like salvation. It might sound cheesy but it’s true: There’s a lot of healing. The wounded will come, will reflect their own scars and pain in the music. It’s saved lives, literally.

That’s not cheesy at all. I don’t know where I’d be without David Bowie, speaking of.

Kijak: He executive produced my Scott Walker movie. What’s amazing is he would give props to the people he loved, and he was kind of the godfather of that.

Yoshiki: He’s the reason I went overseas. I did an interview with him, and asked him, “Where do you draw the line between being you and being onstage?” He couldn’t answer. At that time, I didn’t speak English, so I asked him in Japanese with a translator.

How long was this project in the works?

Kijak: From shooting to finished product was a little under a year and a half. We started shooting at the preparations for MSG in October of 2014. And just went straight through.

Was the plan always to frame it around the MSG shows?

Kijak: Not always. It felt like a framing device, but you make a lot of those decisions in the edit. It was interesting because we had very little pre-production, we were just filming it. And ideas are starting to form, when we came away from those few days and rehearsal I thought, I could make a movie right now. There’s so much subtext and beautiful behind the scenes kind of this world around Yoshiki and the band, and the performance itself, how’s it built from the ground up.

There are moments when you think, he’s never going to pull it off, he’s late, they never finish a rehearsal. And then at the last minute it’s perfect. So that alone is its own drama.

Anything you wish you’d made it into the film that didn’t?

Kijak: Hmm. There is just so much stuff.

I was surprised to see that snippet of David Lynch in there with Yoshiki.

Kijak: Yeah! David Lynch directed the video for “Longing.” And Yoshiki always has people filming behind the scenes, very well documented. And it was an accident. It wasn’t listed on the log. I was just randomly going through tapes one day being like, “What’s on here?” And I just put it in and there he was, on a megaphone, shouting at Yoshiki on a desert with fire. And he’s nude. Like, what is this?

David Lynch is one of my heroes, so to be able to fold that in and that kind of influenced how we told the story. To layer subtle images and kind of...I was inspired by the use of doppelgangers and doubles in the movie to create these sorts of splits in the visual world of the film. So he kind of inspired that.

Yoshiki: When I was on the label with Sony, they thought I was going to die next week or tomorrow. So they said shoot anything Yoshiki’s doing. So that’s when the shooting started.

Kijak: I can think of a scene we can cut...I don’t know. I think we got the goods in there. There are a few songs I love that I wished we could have maybe seen more performance. Maybe there’s a companion piece that’s just the film. I would have liked if Pata said more than two words to me (laughs). Some of the band members are very quiet.

Was anyone resistant to the idea of a documentary?

Kijak: No, everyone was pretty open.

Yoshiki: They don’t talk during band meetings either! During meetings I’m talking like 90% and Toshi talks some. It was very organically made, we didn’t really act or anything. It was very natural.

Kijak: I just went where the action is, really, and generally it’s around Yoshiki.

Do you think the landscape is more open now for non-English-speaking bands that are trying to find mainstream success in the U.S.?

Yoshiki: The Internet changed everything. When we started, we never thought...actually X Japan became famous while we’re not doing X Japan. After we disbanded. Ten years later, we were reunited and with fans all over the world. How did it happen? I think that’s the beginning. I think it’s a time when anything could happen.

Kijak: I don’t think people’s tastes are dictated by the charts, too. Kids are just diving in, finding connections I never would have as a kid. I was like, oh, it has to be all new wave, has to be this. And I think they’re really eclectic now.

I believe recently it’s been reported that older music is outselling new music for the first time in history? People are constantly going back and back and back, so hopefully all the X Japan will go back into the charts, and the new one will come up at number one! But I’m surprised with how varied young people’s tastes are. They know old jazz artists and X Japan. It runs the gamut. It’s a pluralism that has never existed before. People discovering new genres that have never existed. And it gives you the freedom to like things that you couldn’t have before, because you were a punk or couldn’t listen

Yoshiki: When I first came to America, we signed to Atlantic Records. They said you go heavy or soft. You can’t do both. But X Japan is doing the heavy stuff, a ballad, catchy stuff. It’s a mix of everything. But 20 years ago it was a no no. But we didn’t listen to them. We made our own style.",11204
489812926828924928,false,"#MH17 was shot down by ""terrorists,"" an advisor to Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs says http://t.co/0t9mYJ2kEy http://t.co/bJvobNucSo",http://cnn.it/WkankX,True,U.S. official: Missile shot down Malaysia Airlines plane,"Send iReport your photos and videos.

(CNN) -- A Malaysia Airlines passenger jet crashed in a rebel-controlled part of eastern Ukraine on Thursday, spurring swift accusations from Ukrainian officials that ""terrorists"" shot down the aircraft.

The United States has concluded a missile shot down the plane, but hasn't pinpointed who was responsible, a senior U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr.

The Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard fell from the sky near the town of Torez in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, officials said. A top Ukrainian official said the plane, which was on the way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was flying at about 10,000 meters (nearly 33,000 feet) when the missile hit.

A radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down, the senior U.S. official said. A second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit, the official said. The United States is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from, the official said.

The Obama administration believes Ukraine did not have the capability in the region -- let alone the motivation -- to shoot down the plane, a U.S. official told CNN's Jake Tapper.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the plane never made a distress call.

He called for an international team to have full access to the crash site.

""We must and we will find out precisely what happened to this flight. No stone will be left unturned,"" he said.

""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice,"" Najib said.

Ukrainian officials maintained that pro-Russian separatists were behind the crash.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the separatists was to blame.

""This tragedy would not have happened, if there had been peace on that land, or in any case, if military operations in southeastern Ukraine had not been renewed,"" Putin said in televised remarks. ""And without a doubt the government of the territory on which it happened bears responsibility for this frightening tragedy.""

Ukraine's state security chief accused two Russian military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished.

Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers. ""Now you know who carried out this crime. We will do everything for the Russian military who carried out this crime to be punished,"" he told reporters.

The jet plunged toward the ground in a fireball, leaving a trail of black smoke behind in the sky.

Emergency crews scrambled to what witnesses described as a staggering scene of death and utter destruction.

""People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and that everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside,"" said Noah Sneider, an American freelance journalist who interviewed witnesses at the scene.

Charred wreckage stretched for kilometers, he said. Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields.

""As you walk through the fields, you see a man with his cracked iPhone sticking out of his pocket. You see sort of people's clothing everywhere. Most of it's kind of ripped off by the air. There's some suitcases and stuff in a pile by the road,"" Sneider said.

There were many bodies left to be found as night fell, he said, and people were trying to figure out what to do next.

Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said.

""One man said to me, 'Nothing's happened in this village for 30 years, and now this,'"" Sneider said.

As details emerge, accusations fly

Details -- and accusations -- quickly poured in about Thursday's crash, which came the same week that Ukrainian officials said a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane while the aircraft was in Ukrainian airspace.

Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, said in a Facebook post that ""terrorists"" fired on the plane operating a Buk surface-to-air missile system.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko described the crash as a ""terrorist action.""

""We do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the Ukraine Armed Forces did not fire at any targets in the sky,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said, according to his website.

CNN's Richard Quest, an aviation expert, said that it would be ""extremely unusual"" for an airliner at nearly 33,000 feet to be shot down.

From the ground, one could simply look up and tell whether a plane was a commercial aircraft, he said. ""So something is absolutely appalling that's gone on here.""

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said that Ukraine's president had accepted an offer of U.S. experts to help investigate the crash.

""They will be on their way rapidly to see if we can get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

Biden said the plane was apparently shot down, adding ""not an accident, blown out of the sky.""

Who was on the plane?

The 15 crew members on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were all Malaysian nationals, officials said.

Malaysia Airlines also gave a breakdown of the known nationalities of the 283 passengers: 154 were Dutch, 27 were Australians, 28 were Malaysians, 12 were Indonesian, nine were from the United Kingdom, four were from Germany; four were from Belgium, three were from the Philippines and one was Canadian. Authorities were still trying to determine the nationalities of the other passengers.

The International AIDS Society said in a statement that ""a number of colleagues and friends"" were on the plane, on the way to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia.

""At this incredibly sad and sensitive time the IAS stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy,"" the statement said.

Russia-Ukraine dispute

The route the Malaysian plane was on, between Kuala Lumpur and the Netherlands, is a common one, CNN aviation safety consultant Mary Schiavo said Thursday. She said that the plane was flying over a troubled area and that close communication with air traffic controllers would be a key necessity.

Torez is in a rebel-held area.

In hostile or disputed areas, ""any alteration from your course, and you can have a problem,"" Schiavo said.

Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Ukrainian forces have been struggling to quell the separatist unrest. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian separatists.

The Pentagon said Wednesday that Russia now has 12,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, as well as some heavy weapons. The troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year.

READ: Obama imposes new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine

On Thursday, CNN reported that Ukrainian officials said a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian jet Wednesday as the jet flew in Ukrainian airspace.

Tensions are high over that incident, separate from the breaking news of the Malaysian flight Thursday.

Three months ago, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying in areas not far from where Flight 17 reportedly crashed Thursday. ""Due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities and for the related potential misidentification of civil aircraft, United States flight operations are prohibited until further notice in the airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov,"" the FAA said in April. Thursday's plane crash reportedly was in eastern Ukraine, scores of miles north-northeast of the Sea of Azov.

On Thursday, French transportation official Frederic Cuvillier ordered that French airlines avoid Ukrainian airspace until the cause of Thursday's Malaysia Airlines crash is known, the French Transportation Ministry said in a news release.

Airline's troubles

Thursday's crash marks the second time this year that Malaysia Airlines has faced an incident involving a downed plane.

On March 8, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared. That Boeing 777 had 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of 370 or its passengers, despite extensive search efforts.

Flight 370 probably flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said last month.

During the early phase of the search for Flight 370, aircraft and ships scoured vast stretches of the surface of the southern Indian Ocean but found no debris.

Pings initially thought to be from the missing plane's flight recorders led to a concentrated underwater search that turned up nothing.

A new underwater search, farther south, will be broadly in an area where planes and vessels had already looked for debris on the surface of the water. It is expected to begin in August.

The first Boeing 777 entered service in June 1995, and the airplane has flown almost five million flights, accumulating more than 18 million flight hours, according to Boeing's web site. The plane is capable to flying up to 43,100 feet.

What next?

Aviation experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions about Thursday's crash at this early stage.

But all agreed that a massive investigation should be launched, involving parties not involved in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia,

The families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation, and so will the global community, Quest said.

In the coming days, finding and examining the plane's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain, CNN aviation analyst and pilot Miles O'Brien said.

""The big question will be, in whose hands will they fall, and will this be a really objective, international investigation?"" he said.

The wreckage path, O'Brien said, will reveal a lot. If a plane breaks up in midair, which is likely what would happen in a missile strike, there would be a large swath of wreckage, he said, but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure, the debris field would be more concentrated.

When she recovered, she reassessed her priorities. As a star computer scientist, she had lots of job offers, but she turned them all down. “I realised that I didn’t want to spend my life doing anything that was not really worthwhile.”

She decided to start her own business. After a year of false starts she co-founded a company called Talkdesk, which helps other firms set up call centres. By using its software, clients can have one up and running in five minutes, she claims.

Ms Fonseca’s success helps explain why some people are optimistic about the millennial generation in the workplace. At 28, she is providing a completely new service in support of another service that did not exist until quite recently. She lives in Portugal but does business all over the globe.

She sounds very much like several other young entrepreneurs your correspondent met while researching this report, such as a Russian who set up a virtual talent agency for models (castweek.ru); an Asian-American electric cellist who teaches people how to make new sounds using a laptop (danaleong.com); and a Nigerian starting a new publishing house for African romantic novelists (ankarapress.com).

Elite youth today are multilingual, global-minded and digitally native; few can remember life before the internet or imagine how anyone coped without it. The best-known of them changed the world before they turned 30, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and Instagram’s Kevin Systrom. The global economy works well for such people. Digital startups require far less capital than, say, building a factory, and a brilliant piece of software can be distributed to millions at minimal cost. So today’s whippersnappers of great wealth have made their money much faster than the Rockefellers and Carnegies of old.













But the world of work has been less kind to other young folk. Florence Moreau, a young architect in Paris, had the double misfortune to leave university in 2009, when the world economy was on its knees; and to be French. “I really need a full-time, permanent job,” she says. Under France’s 3,800-page labour code, workers on permanent contracts receive generous benefits and are extremely hard to get rid of. So French firms have all but stopped hiring permanent staff: four-fifths of new employees are on short-term contracts. Ms Moreau has had eight jobs, none lasting for longer than 16 months. With a small child at home, she has to keep looking for the next one. “It’s tiring,” she sighs. One employer suggested that she should become an “entrepreneur”, doing the same job as before but as a contractor, so that the firm could keep her on indefinitely without incurring heavy ancillary costs. She refused.

Insiders v outsiders

Youth unemployment in France (using the ILO definition of youth as 15-24-year-olds) is 25% and has been scandalously high for three decades. Occasionally the government tinkers with labour rules, but voters have little appetite for serious reform. Ms Moreau rejects the idea that insiders enjoy too many legal protections, and that this is why outsiders find it so hard to break in. She blames exploitative employers, and doubts that any government, left or right, will fix the problem.

Rigid labour rules are tougher on young workers than older ones. People without much experience find it harder to demonstrate that they are worth employing. And when companies know they cannot easily get rid of duds, they become reluctant to hire anyone at all. This is especially true when the economy is not growing fast and they have to bear the huge fixed cost of all the older permanent employees they took on in easier times.

France is not alone in having such problems. In the euro area, Greece, Spain and Italy all have rules that coddle insiders and discourage outsiders. Their youth unemployment rates are, respectively, 48%, 48% and 40%. Developing countries, too, often have rigid labour markets. Brazilian employees typically cost their employers their salary all over again in legally mandated benefits and taxes. South Africa mixes European-style labour protections with extreme racial preferences. Firms must favour black job applicants even if they are unqualified, so long as they have the “capacity to acquire, within a reasonable time, the ability to do the job”. Some 16% of young Brazilians and a stunning 63% of young South Africans are unemployed. Globally, average youth unemployment is 13% compared with the adult rate of 4.5%. Young people are also more likely than older ones to be in temporary, ill-paid or insecure jobs.

The first ten years are essential. They shape careers in the long term. This is when people develop the soft skills that they do not pick up at school

Joblessness matters for several reasons. First, it is miserable for those concerned. Second, it is a waste of human potential. Time spent e-mailing CVs or lying dejected on the sofa is time not spent fixing boilers, laying cables or building a business. Third, it is fiscally ruinous. If the young cannot get a foot on the career ladder, it is hard to see how in time they will be able to support the swelling number of pensioners. Fourth, joblessness can become self-perpetuating. The longer people are out of work, the more their skills and their self-confidence atrophy, the less appealing they look to potential employers and the more likely they are to give up and subsist on the dole.

This “scarring” effect is worse if you are jobless when young, perhaps because that is when work habits become ingrained. Thomas Mroz of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Tim Savage of Welch Consulting found that someone who is jobless for a mere six months at the age of 22 will earn 8% less at 23 than he otherwise would have done. Paul Gregg and Emma Tominey of the University of Bristol found that men who were jobless in their youth earn 13–21% less at age 42. And David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College found that people who were unemployed in their early 20s are less happy than expected even at the age of 50.

“The first ten years are essential. They shape careers in the long term,” says Stefano Scarpetta of the OECD, a think-tank for mostly rich countries. This is when people develop the soft skills that they do not pick up at school, such as conscientiousness, punctuality and teamwork.

Over the next decade more than 1 billion young people will enter the global labour market, and only 40% will be working in jobs that currently exist, estimates the World Bank. Some 90% of new jobs are created by the private sector. The best thing for job creation is economic growth, so policies that promote growth are particularly good for the young. Removing regulatory barriers can also boost job creation. Mr Scarpetta applauds recent attempts in Spain, Italy and Portugal to make labour rules a bit more flexible, but argues that such laws should generally be much simpler. For example, it would be better to scrap the stark distinction between temporary and permanent contracts and have only one basic type of contract in which benefits and job security accumulate gradually. Denmark shows how a labour market can be flexible and still give workers a sense of security. Under its “flexicurity” system companies can hire and fire easily. Unemployed workers are supported by the state, which helps them with retraining and finding new jobs.

Trade unions often favour a minimum wage. This can help those who already have jobs, but if it is set too high it can crowd out those with the fewest skills and the least experience, who tend to be young. It makes more sense to subsidise wages through a negative income tax, thus swelling take-home pay for the lowliest workers without making them more expensive for the employer. But this costs taxpayers money, so many governments prefer to raise the legal minimum wage, passing the cost on to others. America’s Democratic Party is pushing to double the federal minimum wage, to $15 an hour—a certain job-killer.

Putting the tyke into tycoon

Making it easier for young people to start their own business is essential, too. They may be full of energy and open to new ideas, but the firms they create are typically less successful than those launched by older entrepreneurs. The young find it harder to raise capital because they generally have a weaker credit history and less collateral. They usually also know less about the industry they are seeking to enter and have fewer contacts than their older peers. A survey by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor found that businesses run by entrepreneurs over the age of 35 were 1.7 times as likely to have survived for more than 42 months as those run by 25-34-year-olds.

Young sub-Saharan Africans show the greatest enthusiasm for starting their own business: 52% say they would like to, compared with only 19% in rich Western countries. This is partly because many have little choice. There are fewer good jobs available in poor countries, and in the absence of a welfare state few people can afford to do nothing.

Bamaiyi Guche, a Nigerian 17-year-old, is a typical example of a poor-country entrepreneur. He goes to school from 8 to 12 every morning, then spends the afternoon in the blazing sun selling small water sachets to other poor people without running water in their homes. He makes $1 a day, half of which goes on his school fees. He wants to be a doctor one day.

Some youngsters from well-off families forge careers as “social entrepreneurs”, seeking new ways to do good. Keren Wong, for example, recognises that she was “born into privilege”. (Her parents were prosperous enough to support her at Cornell University.) A Chinese-American, she now runs a non-profit called BEAM which connects teachers in rural Chinese schools so they can swap ideas for teaching more effectively.

Alas, there is a huge mismatch everywhere between the skills that many young people can offer and the ones that employers need. Ms Fonseca says she cannot find the right talent for Talkdesk. “I need very good engineers, very good designers and people who speak very good English. But there aren’t enough of them,” she says. As economies grow more sophisticated, demand for cognitive skills will keep rising. The world’s schools are not even close to meeting it.",10574
693523133920342016,non-rumor,Quote of the Day https://t.co/LgOripsSJb https://t.co/6wfGY8vPUs,http://nyti.ms/1SiMuVB,True,Flint Weighs Scope of Harm to Children Caused by Lead in Water,"Of all the concerns raised by the contamination of Flint’s water supply, and the failure of the state and federal governments to promptly address the crisis after it began nearly two years ago, none are more chilling than the possibility that children in this tattered city may have suffered irreversible damage to their developing brains and nervous systemsfrom exposure to lead.

New concerns surfaced Friday when officials said that recent tests of unfiltered tap water in Flint had found levels of lead in some samples higher than what filters distributed to residents were designed to remove.

Nicole Lurie, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the United States Public Health Service, said 26 water samples, out of nearly 4,000 collected, contained lead at levels higher than 150 parts per billion. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that lead in drinking water should be below 15 parts per billion.

Flint residents received filters designed to remove lead up to 150 parts per billion, Ms. Lurie said, adding that they could still be effective above that level.

“This does not mean that we think there’s a problem with the filters,” she said. “In fact, everything we know tells us that they are performing well.”

Still, she said, all residents should have their water tested as soon as possible. Officials also cautioned that children under 6 and pregnant women should use bottled water for drinking and preparing food.

Residents and advocates have expressed outrage over the government’s failure to protect Flint’s children, something many of them say would not have happened if the city were largely white. Adding to their injury, they say, are the harsh conditions of poverty that have already placed obstacles in their young lives.

At the same time, many are turning their attention to the future, when the effects of consuming lead-laced water for months may be all too evident.

At the center of those efforts is Dr. Hanna-Attisha, whose research documenting a spike in children’s blood lead levels forced dismissive government officials to acknowledge the water crisis last fall. With her colleagues at Hurley Children’s Hospital, where she directs the pediatric residency program, she is at the forefront of the scramble to put in place the resources so that every child who needs extra help learning or overcoming medical problems will have support for years to come.

Decades of research have found that exposure to even low levels of lead can profoundly affect children’s growth, behavior and intelligence over time. Studies have linked elevated lead levels in blood to learning disabilities, problems with attention and fine motor coordination, and even violent behavior.

Younger children and fetuses are especially vulnerable because of their developing brains and nervous systems, which is why the efforts here will focus on children 5 and younger.

Emails released by the office of Gov. Rick Snyder last week referred to a resident who said she was told by a state nurse in January 2015, regarding her son’s elevated blood lead level, “It is just a few IQ points. ... It is not the end of the world.” Dr. Hanna-Attisha and others who have studied lead poisoning have a sharply different view of lead exposure, for which there is no cure. “If you were going to put something in a population to keep them down for generations to come, it would be lead,” Dr. Hanna-Attisha said.

Underlying the problem are the troubling conditions prevalent among low-income children and their families in cities like Flint: spotty access to doctors and health care services; a dearth of healthy foods; living conditions so poor that many of the children may have already been exposed to lead poisoning from the paint in their homes; parents with limited time and financial resources.

The doctors here said they would focus on improving the diets of affected children and expanding education programs like Head Start, the federally funded preschool program for low-income children, which has a waiting list in Flint. Dr. Hanna-Attisha has submitted dozens of recommendations to the governor, state legislators and federal officials.

It remains a wish list at this point, but she and others believe that with Flint’s public health crisis in the national spotlight, the city’s chances of getting help are better than ever before.

Mr. Snyder and the State Legislature have so far allocated $28 million in emergency state spending for Flint. Some of the money will provide initial services, like health assessments and home visits from nurses, to lead-exposed children. Mr. Snyder has also asked the federal government to expand Medicaid to cover every Flint resident younger than 21, regardless of income level. And Democrats in Congress said on Thursday that they would seek $600 million in federal aid for Michigan to help Flint.

Local philanthropic groups have set up a charitable fund with the goal of improving health outcomes for children exposed to lead, including through Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s project, the Pediatric Public Health Initiative. Psychologists, nutritionists and child development experts are among the participants in the project, which Hurley is overseeing with Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine, where Dr. Hanna-Attisha is an assistant professor of pediatrics.

“We have a unique opportunity to build a model public health program here,” Dr. Hanna-Attisha said. “We have to throw every single evidence-based resource at these kids, starting now.”

It is impossible to gauge how each child will be affected, partly because the developmental effects of lead poisoning may take years to emerge. A flurry of lead testing has taken place since October, when the Genessee County Health Department finally declared a public health emergency. The agency told residents to stop drinking the water, which was coming from the Flint River, rather than Lake Huron, in an attempt to save money.

Experts say the testing may provide false reassurance. Most residents have probably switched to drinking bottled water, and since lead can be detected in the blood for only about a month, test results may not reflect the extent of their exposure.

“Our kids are already rattled by every kind of toxic stress you can think of,” Dr. Hanna-Attisha said. “Every single day in our clinic we have a 40 percent no-show rate, and it’s not because parents don’t love their children.”

She emphasized, however, that not every child exposed to lead would suffer ill effects. Kim Dietrich, a professor of environmental health at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, said that based partly on the blood lead levels of children in Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study, he did not think serious long-term health problems would be widespread.

About 57 percent of Flint’s 99,000 residents are black, and 40 percent live in poverty, one of the highest rates in the nation for a city its size. Bilal Tawwab, the superintendent of the city school system, said that one school nurse serves the 5,400 students in the district, but that he hoped some of the money flowing into Flint might help open health centers in every school.

He also hoped to make prekindergarten available to every 4-year-old — spaces are limited — and to hire more experienced teachers for special education.

“That’s the piece that keeps me up at night,” he said. “It costs almost double to educate a student with special needs. And our wages, our salaries, are so low.”

Ruth Ann Norton, executive director of the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, based in Baltimore, said that even children who got intensive educational help after lead exposure might face lifelong obstacles.

“Even kids who are able to get through school, and even to get to college, they struggle,” she said. “And I will tell you that they are exhausted.”

Dr. Hanna-Attisha and others are urging families to feed their children foods rich in calcium, iron and vitamin C, which can help minimize the amount of lead their bodies absorb. Yet that raises another problem: Flint is a food desert, with no large grocery stores within the city limits.

Dr. Hanna-Attisha said that while lead was the primary concern, the researchers also worried about the effect of total trihalomethanes, or TTHMs, chemical compounds found in Flint’s water after the city pumped extra chlorine into the system to address bacteria problems after switching to river water. Some studies have linked TTHMs in water to higher miscarriage rates.

Many in Flint have had skin irritation and rashes in the past 18 months, which Dr. Hanna-Attisha attributes to the extra chlorine and TTHMs in the water. Because they were slow to make the connection, she and other doctors are trying to make up for it, with checkups for young children presenting a prime opportunity.

At Taeyana’s appointment, Dr. Hanna-Attisha held the baby’s face close to hers as she rattled off instructions that were the same as she had been giving for years, but were more urgent now.

“Her brain is growing so much from now until she’s 2,” she told Ms. Towns, “so this is when you want to read to her and sing to her and smile at her and tell her what you’re doing every minute.”

The family would return next week for King’s checkup, and his first lead test. For now, Ms. Towns is focused on getting through each day, making sure she has enough bottled water to prepare formula for Taeyana every two hours.

Demonstrators held a 'die-in' Sunday to mark 100 days since the unarmed Ferguson, Missouri teen was killed. They also convened to, among other things, prepare for the imminent court decision by issuing 'rules of engagement' for police there for crowd control, the New York Times reports.

Many of the the high-profile protesters met with President Obama and discussed the matter November 5, including Reverend Al Sharpton. It was a meeting the Gateway Pundit notes was not included on the president's daily schedule.

Sharpton told the Times that Obama urged the group to 'stay on course.'

'[Mr. Obama] was concerned about Ferguson staying on course in terms of pursuing what it was that he knew we were advocating. He said he hopes that we're doing all we can to keep peace.'

A crowd of a couple hundred demonstrators, angry about the fatal August shooting took to the streets of St. Louis on Sunday, briefly blocking a major intersection in protest.

Dozens of people lay down in the street outside of a downtown theater hosting a film festival, pretending to have been shot by other demonstrators playing the role of police officers in an action intended to evoke the memory of 18-year-old Brown, who died 100 days ago in front of his home in the suburb of Ferguson.

On course: Rev. Al Sharpton revealed the President secretly met with Ferguson protestors

Marchers went on to briefly block a major intersection near Washington University and the event ended without any of the violence that was seen in Ferguson following Brown's shooting death by police officer Darren Wilson.

'This is a mature movement. It is a different movement that it was in August. Then it just had anger, justifiable anger,' said DeRay McKesson, a 29-year-old protest leader, as wet snow fell on the city. 'Now we are organized. We are strategizing. And we are going to bring our message to the power structure.'

A grand jury, sitting in the county seat of Clayton,Missouri, is currently deliberating whether to bring criminal charges against Wilson. Many residents and officials in the region fear another wave of rioting similar to the one in August that led to the burning out of multiple businesses if the grand jury decides not to charge Wilson.

'We are bracing for that possibility. That is what many people are expecting. The entire community is going to be upset,' if Wilson is not indicted, said Jose Chavez, 46, a leader of the local Latinos en Axion group.

There have been conflicting witness accounts of the shooting, with some saying that Brown had his hands up in surrender while others have described it as a struggle between Brown and Wilson.

Ferguson and its surroundings have been fairly quiet the last few days as both police and protesters plan their response to the grand jury's report.

'We've decided not to wait for that decision. We've decided to get started,' said Rockit Ali, a 22-year-old organizer of Sunday's demonstration, who marched in a Spider-Man mask.

While Sunday's event had been planned as a nonviolent action, Ali said that violence could not be ruled out if the grand jury finds Wilson without fault.

From Boston to Los Angeles, police departments are bracing for large demonstrations when the grand jury decides.

The St. Louis County grand jury, which has been meeting since August 20, is expected to decide this month whether Officer Darren Wilson is charged with a crime for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown after ordering him and a friend to stop walking in the street on August 9.

For some cities, a decision in the racially charged case will, inevitably, reignite long-simmering debates over local police relations with minority communities.

'It's definitely on our radar,' said Lt. Michael McCarthy, police spokesman in Boston, where police leaders met privately Wednesday to discuss preparations. 'Common sense tells you the timeline is getting close. We're just trying to prepare in case something does step off, so we are ready to go with it.'

In Los Angeles, rocked by riots in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, police officials say they've been in touch with their counterparts in Missouri, where Gov. Jay Nixon and St. Louis-area law enforcement held a news conference this week on their own preparations.

RESIDENTS OF TOWN NEAR FERGUSON WARNED: BE READY A St. Louis County town that neighbors Ferguson, Missouri, is warning residents to prepare for potential unrest that may follow the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case. Berkeley officials passed out flyers this week urging its 9,000 residents to be prepared just as they would in the event of a major storm, with plenty of food, water and medicine on hand in case they're unable to leave home for several days. The flyer says Lambert Airport will be protected by the National Guard, but airport spokesman Jeff Lea says that's wrong. Lea says the airport will continue to be protected by its own security force. Brown was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. A suburban St. Louis school district says schools will get early notice once the Ferguson grand jury reaches a decision. A letter on the Hazelwood School District's site from Superintendent Grayling Tobias says the St. Louis County prosecutor's office will alert districts 24 hours before the media if the decision is on a weekend. If it's a weekday, Tobias says districts will learn three hours before media, so students can be sent home before potential protests. District spokesman Jack Wang says districts won't be told what the decision is. The grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old who was black and unarmed. A prosecutor's office spokesman didn't return messages seeking comment.

Indict America: Protesters made some startling statements as they awaited the grand jury decision

'Naturally, we always pay attention,' said Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a police spokesman. 'We saw what happened when there were protests over there and how oftentimes protests spill from one part of the country to another.'

In Las Vegas, police joined pastors and other community leaders this week to call for restraint at a rally tentatively planned northwest of the casino strip when a decision comes.

In Boston, a group called Black Lives Matter, which has chapters in other major cities, is organizing a rally in front of the police district office in the Roxbury neighborhood the day after an indictment decision.

In Albuquerque, New Mexico, police are expecting demonstrations after having dealt with a string of angry protests following a March police shooting of a homeless camper and more than 40 police shootings since 2010.

Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. John Stanford said he anticipated his city will see demonstrations, regardless of what the grand jury returns.

But big-city police departments stressed they're well-equipped to handle crowds. Many saw large but mostly peaceful demonstrations following the 2013 not-guilty verdict in the slaying of Florida teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. In New York, hundreds of protesters marched from Union Square north to Times Square, where a sit-in caused gridlock.

The New York Police Department, the largest in the nation, is 'trained to move swiftly and handle events as they come up,' spokesman Stephen Davis said.

In Boston, McCarthy said the city's 2,200 sworn police officers have dealt with the range of public actions, from sports fans spontaneously streaming into the streets following championship victories to protest movements like Occupy.

'The good thing is that our relationships here with the community are much better than they are around the world,' he said. 'People look to us as a model. Boston is not Ferguson.'

766358933296517121,non-rumor,"American swimmers who claimed that they were robbed in Rio should apologize to residents, Brazilian police said. https://t.co/KYan0ekP8i",http://cnn.it/2b7lgzg,True,"US swimmer: Guards pulled guns, wanted money","Rio de Janeiro (CNN) One of the US swimmers involved in an controversial incident at a Rio de Janeiro gas station said Friday that men with badges pulled guns on them and ordered them to pay money in order to leave the scene.

Bentz's statement describes how Lochte, a 12-time medalist who initially said the swimmers were robbed, was the member of the group who damaged property and argued with armed men who appeared to be security guards.

Bentz said the swimmers had been ordered out of a cab and were sitting on a curb as the security guards held their guns when Lochte stood up and got into a heated argument with the guards.

A man who spoke English and Portuguese -- Bentz thinks he was a customer -- offered to translate. The man told the Americans they needed to pay the guards in order to leave.

""I gave them what I had in my wallet, which was a $20 bill, and Jimmy gave them 100 reals, which is about $50 in total,"" Bentz said.

The guards lowered their guns and the swimmers left, walking down the street to find another cab to take them back to the Olympic Village.

Bentz, in a statement released by the University of Georgia , where he is a rising junior, said the swimmers had stopped at the store to use the bathroom. Lochte had pulled a metal advertising sign off a wall as the quartet of swimmers urinated behind the gas station, he said, but there was no damage to a bathroom or its door, which was locked.

The swimmers were trying to leave in a cab when two security guards ordered them out of a cab. Bentz said that as Jack Conger and James Feigen walked away from the car a man held up a badge and pulled a gun on the Americans.

""I yelled to them to come back toward us and they complied,"" he said. ""Then the second guard drew his weapon and both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk.""

In his statement, Bentz apologized to US officials, his teammates and his university.

Bentz also said the guards put down their guns after being paid.

A photo posted by Ryanlochte (@ryanlochte) on Aug 19, 2016 at 7:11am PDT

Earlier this week, Lochte said on Twitter and in a television interview with Olympics broadcaster NBC that the four swimmers were robbed after getting out of the cab.

The case quickly spiraled into an international matter involving consular officials, lawyers and judicial orders. Police accused the swimmers of fabricating the robbery story and being involved in vandalism. Authorities brought three of them in for questioning, Bentz and Conger having been pulled off a plane bound for the United States. Lochte had already returned to the United States by the time police began their investigation.

Bentz said Friday he never made a false statement to anyone, he said. He characterized his interaction with investigators as being a witness.

We were robbed, Lochte said at first

Lochte originally said that he and fellow swimmers were pulled over in their taxi and robbed at gunpoint early Sunday.

""I wanted to apologize for my behavior last weekend -- for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics,"" he said Friday on Instagram.

He said he accepted responsibility for his role in the case and had ""learned some valuable lessons.""

CNN contributor Christine Brennan reported Friday that Lochte will eventually be suspended, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation.

When asked for a comment, USA Swimming told CNN to refer to its latest statement which reads, ""USA Swimming will undergo a thorough review of the incident and determine any further actions, per our Code of Conduct.""

CNN also reached out to the US Olympic Committee, which referred to a statement issued Thursday night that said the organization will ""further review the matter, and any potential consequences for the athletes, when we return to the United States.""

Lochte also did not, however, roll back on his allegations the swimmers had been robbed at gunpoint by men posing as police.

Police said that security guards used guns to control the athletes, adding that the Americans were drunk, and took 100 reals ($20) to cover the damage the men caused.

""It's traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country -- with a language barrier -- and have a stranger point a gun at you and demand money to let you leave,"" Lochte said on Instagram.

""I should have been much more responsible in how I handled myself and for that am sorry to my teammates, my fans, my fellow competitors, my sponsors, and the hosts of this great event. I am very proud to represent my country in Olympic competition and this was a situation that could and should have been avoided.""

The public had awaited Lochte's response after the release of closed-circuit TV footage Thursday that appeared to support at least some of the police's assertions.

Lochte omitted details that led up to what he called a robbery, some of which appeared in the video footage.

But his apology and the video still do not clear up the biggest question -- were the swimmers robbed?

Lochte, Bentz and police do all agree on one thing: A gun was brandished, and money exchanged hands.

The stories, however, seem to diverge at a single point -- when Lochte re-entered a taxi after stopping at the station.

Swimmer donates $11,000 to charity

On Wednesday night, authorities took the extraordinary step of pulling Conger and Bentz from their flight home for questioning. The pair flew to Miami on Friday morning. Bentz returned to Atlanta later in the day and didn't answer questions from reporters at the airport.

Police said in a statement on Facebook that that Feigen had agreed to make a contribution of 35,000 reals (nearly $11,000) to a Brazilian charity organization.

The decision was made, police said, in a court appearancse to answer accusations that the swimmers had made false claims they were robbed.

US Olympic Committee apologizes

The US Olympic Committee's earlier statement also apologized for the athletes' behavior after the video footage came to light.

""On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence,"" a committee statement said.

The statement said that an ""argument ensued between the athletes and two armed gas station security staff, who displayed their weapons, ordered the athletes from their vehicle and demanded the athletes provide a monetary payment. Once the security officials received money from the athletes, the athletes were allowed to leave.""

Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes said Friday he felt ""pity and contempt"" for the swimmers, saying he accepted the US committee's apology.

""I believe that all of us need to accept the apologies of the US Olympic Committee, the same way our Olympic Committee would have had to apologize if the assault had occurred. The apologies have been more than accepted,"" he said.

Charges unlikely, police say

Lochte's attorney, Jeff Ostrow, said the incident still amounted to a robbery and the new information and video did not change that view.

The police early on appeared to have doubts about the 32-year-old swimmer's veracity.

First, they learned on social media that four Americans had reportedly been mugged -- a story Lochte told in hair-raising detail to the US media -- civil police Chief Fernando Veloso said at a news conference Thursday.

JUST WATCHED Lochte previously busted for disorderly conduct, public urination Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lochte previously busted for disorderly conduct, public urination 02:27

They tracked down witnesses, including three of Lochte's fellow swimmers at the scene, reviewed surveillance tapes and made a ruling on whether the accounts looked or sounded like a robbery.

""The surveillance tapes show that there was no violence against the athletes at the gas station,"" Veloso said. ""Their claim that they are a victim of an assault or robbery or any kind of violence is not true.""

Veloso said the other swimmers say it was Lochte who created the lie. ""The only person that continues to say there was a robbery is (Lochte),"" he said after the news conference.

The investigation showed security guards stopped the athletes from leaving the station until police could be called. One pulled a gun on Lochte after he became angrily confrontational, Veloso said.

But Veloso insisted there was no evidence the guard's actions were unreasonable.

Bentz's high school coach: He's handling it well

Atlanta-based swimming coach Jason Turcotte, who trained Bentz in high school at the Dynamo Swim Club, said he and his swimmers have continued to support the embattled Olympian medalist throughout what he believes is a scandal that has been blown out of proportion.

Turcotte said the 20-year-old swimmer, who won a gold medal in the men's 4x200-meter freestyle relay, handled the kerfuffle well ever since he and Conger were removed from a plane. According to Turcotte, Bentz fully cooperated with Rio authorities when asked to provide testimony, where he said that he was not robbed.

He added: ""We're not perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, but once you make a mistake, then the clock starts with how you handle it. In a sea of drama, he handled it pretty well, and now he's home.""",9972

“On and/or about the 20th day of Sept. 20, 2009 at or near 222 S. Florissant within the corporate limits of Ferguson, Missouri, the above named defendant did then and there unlawfully commit the offense of ‘property damage’ to wit did transfer blood to the uniform,” reads the charge sheet.

The address is the headquarters of the Ferguson Police Department, where a 52-year-old welder named Henry Davis was taken in the predawn hours on that date. He had been arrested for an outstanding warrant that proved to actually be for another man of the same surname, but a different middle name and Social Security number.

“I said, ‘I told you guys it wasn’t me,’” Davis later testified.

He recalled the booking officer saying, “We have a problem.”

The booking officer had no other reason to hold Davis, who ended up in Ferguson only because he missed the exit for St. Charles and then pulled off the highway because the rain was so heavy he could not see to drive. The cop who had pulled up behind him must have run his license plate and assumed he was that other Henry Davis. Davis said the cop approached his vehicle, grabbed his cellphone from his hand, cuffed him and placed him in the back seat of the patrol car, without a word of explanation.

But the booking officer was not ready just to let Davis go, and proceeded to escort him to a one-man cell that already had a man in it asleep on the lone bunk. Davis says that he asked the officer if he could at least have one of the sleeping mats that were stacked nearby.

”He said I wasn’t getting one,” Davis said.

Davis balked at being a second man in a one-man cell.

“Because it’s 3 in the morning,” he later testified. “Who going to sleep on a cement floor?”

The booking officer summoned a number of fellow cops. One opened the cell door while another suddenly charged, propelling Davis inside and slamming him against the back wall.

“I told the police officers there that I didn’t do nothing, ‘Why is you guys doing this to me?’” Davis testified. “They said, ‘OK, just lay on the ground and put your hands behind your back.’”

Davis said he complied and that a female officer straddled and then handcuffed him. Two other officers crowded into the cell.

“They started hitting me,” he testified. “I was getting hit and I just covered up.”

The other two stepped out and the female officer allegedly lifted Davis’ head as the cop who had initially pushed him into the cell reappeared.

“He ran in and kicked me in the head,” Davis recalled. “I almost passed out at that point… Paramedics came… They said it was too much blood, I had to go to the hospital.”

A patrol car took the bleeding Davis to a nearby emergency room. He refused treatment, demanding somebody first take his picture.

“I wanted a witness and proof of what they done to me,” Davis said.

He was driven back to the jail, where he was held for several days before he posted $1,500 bond on four counts of “property damage.” Police Officer John Beaird had signed complaints swearing on pain of perjury that Davis had bled on his uniform and those of three fellow officers.

The remarkable turned inexplicable when Beaird was deposed in a civil case that Davis subsequently brought seeking redress and recompense.

“After Mr. Davis was detained, did you have any blood on you?” asked Davis’ lawyer, James Schottel.

“No, sir,” Beaird replied.

Schottel showed Beaird a copy of the “property damage” complaint.

“Is that your signature as complainant?” the lawyer asked.

“It is, sir,” the cop said.

“And what do you allege that Mr. Davis did unlawfully in this one?” the lawyer asked.

“Transferred blood to my uniform while Davis was resisting,” the cop said.

“And didn’t I ask you earlier in this deposition if Mr. Davis got blood on your uniform?”

“You did, sir.”

“And didn’t you respond no?”

“Correct. I did.”

Beaird seemed to be either admitting perjury or committing it. The depositions of other officers suggested that the “property damage” charges were not just bizarre, but trumped up.

“There was no blood on my uniform,” said Police Officer Christopher Pillarick.

And then there was Officer Michael White, the one accused of kicking Davis in the head, an allegation he denies, as his fellow officers deny striking Davis. White had reported suffering a bloody nose in the mayhem.

“Did you see Mr. Davis bleeding at all?” the lawyer, Schottel, asked.

“I did not,” White replied.

“Did Mr. Davis get any blood on you while you were in the cell?” Schottel asked.

“No,” White said.

The contradictions between the complaint and the depositions apparently are what prompted the prosecutor to drop the “property damage” allegation. The prosecutor also dropped a felony charge of assault on an officer that had been lodged more than a year after the incident and shortly after Davis filed his civil suit.

Davis suggested in his testimony that if the police really thought he had assaulted an officer he would have been charged back when he was jailed.

“They would have filed those charges right then and there, because that’s a major felony,” he noted.

Indisputable evidence of what transpired in the cell might have been provided by a surveillance camera, but it turned out that the VHS video was recorded at 32 times normal speed.

“It was like a blur,” Schottel told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “You couldn’t see anything.”

The blur proved to be from 12 hours after the incident anyway. The cops had saved the wrong footage after Schottel asked them to preserve it.

Schottel got another unpleasant surprise when he sought the use-of-force history of the officers involved. He learned that before a new chief took over in 2010 the department had a surprising protocol for non-fatal use-of-force reports.

“The officer himself could complete it and give it to the supervisor for his approval,” the prior chief, Thomas Moonier, testified in a deposition. “I would read it. It would be placed in my out basket, and my secretary would probably take it and put it with the case file.”

No copy was made for the officer’s personnel file.

“Everything involved in an incident would generally be with the police report,” Moonier said. “I don’t know what they maintain in personnel files.”

“Who was in charge of personnel files, of maintaining them?” Schottel asked.

“I have no idea,” Moonier said. “I believe City Hall, but I don’t know.”

Schottel focused on the date of the incident.

“On September 20th, 2009, was there any way to identify any officers that were subject of one or more citizens’ complaints?” he asked.

“Not to my knowledge,” Moonier said.

“Was there any way to identify any officers who had completed several use-of-force reports?”

“I don’t recall.”

But however lax the department’s system and however contradictory the officers’ testimony, a federal magistrate ruled that the apparent perjury about the “property damage” charges was too minor to constitute a violation of due process and that Davis’ injuries were de minimis—too minor to warrant a finding of excessive force. Never mind that a CAT scan taken after the incident confirmed that he had suffered a concussion.

Schottel has appealed and expects to argue the case in December. He will contend that perjury is perjury however minor the charge and note that both the NFL and Major League Baseball have learned to consider a concussion a serious injury.

Schottel figures the courts might take the problems of the Ferguson Police Department as more than de minimis as a result of the protests sparked when an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old named Michael Brown on the afternoon of Aug. 9.

“Your chances on appeal are going up,” a fellow lawyer told him.

At least one witness has said that Brown was shot in the back and then in the chest and head as he turned toward the officer with his hands raised.

“I said, ‘Well, that doesn’t surprise me,’” Schottel told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “I said I already know about Ferguson, nothing new can faze me about Ferguson.”

Schottel has also deposed the new chief, Thomas Jackson, who took over in 2010. Jackson testified that he has instituted a centralized system whereby all complaints lodged against cops by citizens or supervisors go through him and are assigned a number in an internal affairs log. Schottel views Jackson as “not a bad guy,” someone who has been trying to make positive change.

“He wants to do right, but it was such a mess,” Schottel said Wednesday.

Jackson has seemed less than progressive as he delayed identifying the officer involved in the shooting for fear it would place him and his family in danger. Jackson would only say the officer is white and has been on the job for six years. This means that for his first two and most formative years the officer might have been writing his own force reports and that none of them went into his file.

“It’s hard to get people to clean things up, especially if they’re used to doing things a certain way,” Schottel said.

On Friday, police finally identified the officer as Darren Wilson, who is said to have no disciplinary record, as such records are kept in Ferguson. We already know that he started out at a time when it was accepted for a Ferguson cop to charge somebody with property damage for bleeding on his uniform and later saying there was no blood on him at all.",9916

701514249269542912,unverified,"No, the polling doesn't prove Bernie Sanders won the Hispanic vote in Nevada https://t.co/hwF2RrrViw",http://nyti.ms/1OoooAL,True,"No, the Polling Doesn’t Prove Bernie Sanders Won the Hispanic Vote in Nevada","Clinton Won Heavily Hispanic Areas

The Hispanic vote in Nevada is overwhelmingly concentrated in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. In particular, Hispanic voters are concentrated on the east side of the city, where they make up the vast majority of the population but only a slight majority of registered Democrats. (For a rough map, see this tweet.)

In the 76 precincts in Clark County where we believe that a plurality of registered Democrats are Hispanic, Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Sanders in the delegate count by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent. In the smaller number of majority Hispanic precincts, she seemed to win about 60 percent of the delegates, and she won perhaps 65 percent of the delegates in the precincts where Hispanics appeared to be a particularly large share of registered Democrats. (For details on the estimates, see my note at the end of the article.)

Similarly, it was widely reported that Mrs. Clinton fared extremely well in the precincts along the Las Vegas Strip.

Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign press secretary, tweeted that the campaign estimated that Mrs. Clinton won 61 percent of the vote in Hispanic precincts throughout the state.

Does that prove the “entrance polls were wrong,” as Mr. Fallon said? Not on its own. It’s dangerous to infer much about the preferences of a demographic group based on the results of the areas where they live. Hispanic voters who live in majority Hispanic areas might be particularly likely to support Mrs. Clinton. In other words, focusing only on the places where Hispanic voters are most prevalent could provide a misleading picture of Hispanic voters over all. We know that this is an issue in other contexts: Similar analysis would overestimate the Democratic share of the vote among Hispanic voters, or the Republican vote among white voters.

A Democratic pollster unaffiliated with either campaign said that Mr. Sanders does better among nonwhite voters in areas where whites represent a larger share of the population, which would suggest that a precinct-based analysis would understate Mr. Sanders’s strength.

There’s another problem: There were relatively few homogeneous precincts, where almost all of the voters are Hispanic. Even the majority Hispanic precincts in Nevada have large numbers of non-Hispanic voters, who themselves could have been likelier to support Mrs. Clinton (though the findings still hold if one excludes the precincts where there appear to be an above-average number of black voters, who favored Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin).

But it is a stretch to say that Mr. Sanders could have done so well among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas that he overcame a deficit in relatively Hispanic areas, where a large proportion of the Hispanic population lives.

These Polls Are Hardly Perfect

Precinct data isn’t perfect. But I would take it over this entrance/exit poll.

In general, entrance/exit polls are not well suited to measure the Hispanic vote. This one is particularly problematic.

Over all, the poll included just 1,024 respondents — and just 213 Hispanic respondents. In a normal poll, that would imply a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.

But these types of polls are not normal. The margin of error is even higher, at 7 percent, and the true error can easily be much higher.

That’s because an entrance-exit poll isn’t a random sample of the population like a normal poll. It’s a random sample of precincts, usually between 15 and 60 in a state exit poll. This one had just 25 precincts. Race is not usually used as a criteria for selecting precincts.

Precinct selection introduces a whole new dimension of error into an entrance-exit poll for Hispanic voters, or any demographic group that’s concentrated in small areas. The 25 precincts could overrepresent an unrepresented group — imagine if a New York exit poll, by chance, included two Orthodox Jewish precincts in Brooklyn and showed a Republican ahead among Jewish voters — or completely miss a small, geographically concentrated group.

You can imagine how this could wind up creating the opposite risk of the precinct analysis: What if the entrance-exit poll simply doesn’t include a heavily Hispanic precinct where Mrs. Clinton excelled? The danger is real with a sample as small as this, especially in a highly diverse state.

This type of problem is responsible for one of the biggest exit poll controversies in memory: the finding that 44 percent of Hispanic voters supported George W. Bush in 2004. Simply by chance, 3 of the 11 plurality Hispanic precincts were in Miami-Dade County, where Hispanic voters are particularly conservative. The 44 percent finding was four points higher than the result from a compilation of the 50 state exit polls — a difference well outside the formal “margin of error” for a sample of that size.

The exit pollsters are upfront about the issue, as they acknowledged in the exit poll’s postelection analysis in 2004:

“A National Sample of 250 precincts can do a good job estimating all of the broad characteristics of the electorate, but it is not designed to yield very reliable estimates of the characteristics of small, geographically clustered demographic groups. [...] If we want to improve the National Exit Poll estimate for Hispanic vote (or Asian vote, Jewish vote or Mormon vote etc.) we would either need to drastically increase the number of precincts in the National Sample or oversample the number of Hispanic precincts.”

And that’s for a national exit poll of 10 times as many precincts as the one in Nevada.

The exit polls have also been criticized for other issues measuring Hispanic voters, like whether pollsters conduct Spanish-language interviews. They generally do not, although Spanish-language questionnaires are typically offered in Nevada and other states with large Hispanic populations.

In a December interview, Joe Lenski, who runs the exit polls for Edison Research, acknowledged that exit polls “are not the precise measurement of demographics that people would want them to be.” He said that he “cringes” when people say “Oh, that’s the number” and run with it as “absolute truths or precise numbers.”

Referring specifically to the Nevada results, Mr. Lenski added that there are additional errors with caucus and entrance polls. The entrance poll measures initial preferences — those can change at the caucus, and uncommitted is an option that received 3 percent support in initial preference. The delegate tallies don’t necessarily line up with actual vote counts, either; the delegates are allocated only after candidates get 15 percent of the vote. In other words, a candidate could win 60 percent of the delegates without winning 60 percent of the vote.

There were signs of problems Saturday in poll results themselves. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were tied in the initial entrance-exit poll estimates; she ultimately won by around 5.5 points. Clearly the entrance polls missed Mrs. Clinton’s strength somewhere.

Is it possible that the precincts missed Mrs. Clinton’s strength among Hispanic voters in Clark County? Quite possibly. Even the final entrance-exit poll numbers show Mrs. Clinton leading in Clark County by just 5 points; she actually won there by 10 points.

A Clinton Win, but Not a Landslide

It’s tough to give a poll subsample of some 200 respondents much weight, especially when it’s for a clustered group like Hispanics.

It’s even harder to give it credit when there’s so much reason to wonder whether it’s right. Mrs. Clinton fared well in majority Hispanic precincts. National polls show Mrs. Clinton faring well among Hispanic voters — and Mr. Sanders basically finished in line with national polls among both white and black voters.

All evidence considered, and although we can’t know for sure, I’d err on the side of a Clinton win among Hispanic voters.

But it would be hard to argue that she won Hispanic voters by a lot. Sixty percentage points could easily be too high if she indeed fared better among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas. The entrance-exit poll result may not be perfect, but it certainly seems consistent with this possibility. If I had to bet, I’d say she won Hispanic voters by a somewhat more modest margin.

It would still imply that Mr. Sanders made big gains over the last month. But it would still be short of what he would need to overcome Mrs. Clinton’s vast strength among black voters. She won them by a huge margin, whether you look at the entrance-exit polling or majority black precincts.

In assessing delegate counts, the estimates used are not perfect.

The Hispanic vote in Nevada is overwhelmingly concentrated in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. In particular, Hispanic voters are concentrated on the east side of the city, where they make up the vast majority of the population but only a slight majority of registered Democrats. (For a rough map, see this tweet.)

In the 76 precincts in Clark County where we believe that a plurality of registered Democrats are Hispanic, Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Sanders in the delegate count by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent. In the smaller number of majority Hispanic precincts, she seemed to win about 60 percent of the delegates, and she won perhaps 65 percent of the delegates in the precincts where Hispanics appeared to be a particularly large share of registered Democrats. (For details on the estimates, see my note at the end of the article.)

Similarly, it was widely reported that Mrs. Clinton fared extremely well in the precincts along the Las Vegas Strip.

Brian Fallon, the Clinton campaign press secretary, tweeted that the campaign estimated that Mrs. Clinton won 61 percent of the vote in Hispanic precincts throughout the state.

Does that prove the “entrance polls were wrong,” as Mr. Fallon said? Not on its own. It’s dangerous to infer much about the preferences of a demographic group based on the results of the areas where they live. Hispanic voters who live in majority Hispanic areas might be particularly likely to support Mrs. Clinton. In other words, focusing only on the places where Hispanic voters are most prevalent could provide a misleading picture of Hispanic voters over all. We know that this is an issue in other contexts: Similar analysis would overestimate the Democratic share of the vote among Hispanic voters, or the Republican vote among white voters.

A Democratic pollster unaffiliated with either campaign said that Mr. Sanders does better among nonwhite voters in areas where whites represent a larger share of the population, which would suggest that a precinct-based analysis would understate Mr. Sanders’s strength.

There’s another problem: There were relatively few homogeneous precincts, where almost all of the voters are Hispanic. Even the majority Hispanic precincts in Nevada have large numbers of non-Hispanic voters, who themselves could have been likelier to support Mrs. Clinton (though the findings still hold if one excludes the precincts where there appear to be an above-average number of black voters, who favored Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin).

But it is a stretch to say that Mr. Sanders could have done so well among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas that he overcame a deficit in relatively Hispanic areas, where a large proportion of the Hispanic population lives.

These Polls Are Hardly Perfect

Precinct data isn’t perfect. But I would take it over this entrance/exit poll.

In general, entrance/exit polls are not well suited to measure the Hispanic vote. This one is particularly problematic.

Over all, the poll included just 1,024 respondents — and just 213 Hispanic respondents. In a normal poll, that would imply a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.

But these types of polls are not normal. The margin of error is even higher, at 7 percent, and the true error can easily be much higher.

That’s because an entrance-exit poll isn’t a random sample of the population like a normal poll. It’s a random sample of precincts, usually between 15 and 60 in a state exit poll. This one had just 25 precincts. Race is not usually used as a criteria for selecting precincts.

Precinct selection introduces a whole new dimension of error into an entrance-exit poll for Hispanic voters, or any demographic group that’s concentrated in small areas. The 25 precincts could overrepresent an unrepresented group — imagine if a New York exit poll, by chance, included two Orthodox Jewish precincts in Brooklyn and showed a Republican ahead among Jewish voters — or completely miss a small, geographically concentrated group.

You can imagine how this could wind up creating the opposite risk of the precinct analysis: What if the entrance-exit poll simply doesn’t include a heavily Hispanic precinct where Mrs. Clinton excelled? The danger is real with a sample as small as this, especially in a highly diverse state.

This type of problem is responsible for one of the biggest exit poll controversies in memory: the finding that 44 percent of Hispanic voters supported George W. Bush in 2004. Simply by chance, 3 of the 11 plurality Hispanic precincts were in Miami-Dade County, where Hispanic voters are particularly conservative. The 44 percent finding was four points higher than the result from a compilation of the 50 state exit polls — a difference well outside the formal “margin of error” for a sample of that size.

The exit pollsters are upfront about the issue, as they acknowledged in the exit poll’s postelection analysis in 2004:

“A National Sample of 250 precincts can do a good job estimating all of the broad characteristics of the electorate, but it is not designed to yield very reliable estimates of the characteristics of small, geographically clustered demographic groups. [...] If we want to improve the National Exit Poll estimate for Hispanic vote (or Asian vote, Jewish vote or Mormon vote etc.) we would either need to drastically increase the number of precincts in the National Sample or oversample the number of Hispanic precincts.”

And that’s for a national exit poll of 10 times as many precincts as the one in Nevada.

The exit polls have also been criticized for other issues measuring Hispanic voters, like whether pollsters conduct Spanish-language interviews. They generally do not, although Spanish-language questionnaires are typically offered in Nevada and other states with large Hispanic populations.

In a December interview, Joe Lenski, who runs the exit polls for Edison Research, acknowledged that exit polls “are not the precise measurement of demographics that people would want them to be.” He said that he “cringes” when people say “Oh, that’s the number” and run with it as “absolute truths or precise numbers.”

Referring specifically to the Nevada results, Mr. Lenski added that there are additional errors with caucus and entrance polls. The entrance poll measures initial preferences — those can change at the caucus, and uncommitted is an option that received 3 percent support in initial preference. The delegate tallies don’t necessarily line up with actual vote counts, either; the delegates are allocated only after candidates get 15 percent of the vote. In other words, a candidate could win 60 percent of the delegates without winning 60 percent of the vote.

There were signs of problems Saturday in poll results themselves. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were tied in the initial entrance-exit poll estimates; she ultimately won by around 5.5 points. Clearly the entrance polls missed Mrs. Clinton’s strength somewhere.

Is it possible that the precincts missed Mrs. Clinton’s strength among Hispanic voters in Clark County? Quite possibly. Even the final entrance-exit poll numbers show Mrs. Clinton leading in Clark County by just 5 points; she actually won there by 10 points.

A Clinton Win, but Not a Landslide

It’s tough to give a poll subsample of some 200 respondents much weight, especially when it’s for a clustered group like Hispanics.

It’s even harder to give it credit when there’s so much reason to wonder whether it’s right. Mrs. Clinton fared well in majority Hispanic precincts. National polls show Mrs. Clinton faring well among Hispanic voters — and Mr. Sanders basically finished in line with national polls among both white and black voters.

All evidence considered, and although we can’t know for sure, I’d err on the side of a Clinton win among Hispanic voters.

But it would be hard to argue that she won Hispanic voters by a lot. Sixty percentage points could easily be too high if she indeed fared better among Hispanic voters in non-Hispanic areas. The entrance-exit poll result may not be perfect, but it certainly seems consistent with this possibility. If I had to bet, I’d say she won Hispanic voters by a somewhat more modest margin.

715268937873760256,unverified,"Donald Trump goes full anti-woman: ""punishment"" for women who abort https://t.co/jy0cb52s5Z https://t.co/5MEznuWVi1",http://huff.to/1TjayHg,True,"Donald Trump Goes Full Anti-Woman, Suggests 'Punishment' For Women Who Abort","APPLETON, Wis. -- Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Wednesday that there ""has to be some form of punishment"" for abortion if it were banned in the U.S. -- as he says it should be -- and that punishment should fall on the woman.

Trump, who is currently struggling with women voters, was pressed on the issue of abortion during an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, set to air Wednesday evening.

Matthews asked whether abortion should be punished, and Trump initially skated around the issue. He said some Republicans would say it should be, and that he ""would say it’s a very serious problem and it’s a problem we have to decide on.""

He then asked Matthews -- but didn't answer himself -- ""Are you going to, say, put them to jail?"" and added he was anti-abortion and that ""you have to ban"" abortion.

""There has to be some form of punishment,"" Trump said, adding ""Yeah"" when Matthews asked if he meant for the woman. The host asked if that punishment would be closer to 10 days or 10 years, and Trump said he didn't know.

Trump indicated he would be far more lenient on the man who impregnated a woman who had an abortion -- he said he did not think they would bear the same level of responsibility.

The Trump campaign quickly tried to walk back his comments afterward, saying the matter should be decided by the states. Later, Trump put out a statement that said his position was unchanged, but contradicted his past statements entirely:

If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed -- like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.

Most women who spoke with The Huffington Post at Trump's town hall in Appleton, Wisconsin, on Wednesday said they did not agree that women should be held criminally liable if they had an abortion. But Trump's initial position did not seem to weigh heavily on their support of the real estate mogul, whom they unanimously described in positive terms as a good family man who would be good for women if elected president.

""No,"" said Appleton resident Sarah Schnell, when asked if she agreed with Trump on the matter. ""And I'm pro-life. But I think that that's something that's going to have to be decided between a woman and God. I don't think that's right, I'm against it, but I don't go as far as saying the government should get involved in it.""

Cathy Smith, a caretaker of people with disabilities in nearby Freemont, said ""a woman should be able to do whatever she wants.""

Lucy Deboard, a sanitarian who recently moved to Wisconsin from New Jersey, said she didn't agree with Trump. But, she added, the issue of abortion was far down on the totem pole when compared to national security.

""I don't vote based on abortions. I think there's more important things,"" said Deboard, who described herself as pro-choice. ""Look, if ISIS comes over and kills us, I'm not real concerned with abortions. There's more important things to deal with here. We're way beyond abortions here. If you want abortion, you can go get one. I guess I'm pro-choice, but I'm not strong. Like I said, I have more important issues I'm concerned about.""

Lynn Paulus, an Oshkosh resident who described herself as pro-life ""to a point,"" also sounded her disagreement with Trump.

""If there is a woman that has been raped, I believe in exceptions. No, I don't believe in holding them criminally liable,"" Paulus added.

Debra Lynn, an esthetician from Green Bay, put her objection in Biblical terms.

""If they're not punished on Earth, they'll be punished in the long run,"" she said.

Abortion bans supported by Republicans usually make it a crime for doctors to perform the procedure, rather than for patients to obtain it.

Trump has been slippery on his stances on abortion, as with many other issues. He previously said he was in favor of abortion rights and “very pro-choice,” before changing his stance. He said he would defund Planned Parenthood, and yet offered a defense of its other services.

Republicans opposed to abortion rights already punish patients who seek the procedure, so Trump was just making their philosophy more explicit. A record number of restrictions on abortion have been passed since Republicans swept control in a slew of state legislatures in 2010; many of these provisions are meant to dissuade patients from seeking abortions and punish them if they do.

Requiring a patient undergo a waiting period of 24, 48 or 72 hours before having an abortion is a form of punishment. Banning telemedicine for medication abortion punishes patients in rural areas. Requiring an ultrasound in which the provider describes the details of the fetus to the patient is a form of punishment. Mandating biased counseling, in which doctors are required to tell patients that abortion causes breast cancer or depression, is a form of punishment.

Forcing providers to use an outdated regimen for administering medication abortions, which carries a higher risk of side-effects, is a form of punishment. Laws preventing providers from using the method used in the vast majority of second-trimester abortions, because it is the safest, punish patients. And requiring adolescents to get permission from both of their parents to have the procedure, while mandating abstinence-based sex education at the same time, punishes teens for getting pregnant.

Lastly, the Hyde Amendment, which is routinely inserted into appropriations bills, punishes low-income patients by preventing Medicaid from covering the procedure.

""I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the … Medicaid bill,” said former Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) during debate over Medicaid funding for abortion in 1977.

Trump has a long history of anti-woman comments, and this month has come under fire for his treatment of opponent Sen. Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and for sticking by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after he was charged with battery against a female reporter.

Reuters found earlier this month that half of all women have a “very unfavorable” view of the GOP front-runner.

Just 19 percent of Americans believe abortion should be illegal under all circumstances, according to Gallup, so Democrats and reproductive rights groups are guaranteed to seize upon Trump’s comments to argue that the Republican Party is out of step with public opinion on the issue.

Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) quickly responded on Twitter.

Just when you thought it couldn't get worse. Horrific and telling. -H https://t.co/Qi8TutsOw9 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016

Your Republican frontrunner, ladies and gentlemen. Shameful. https://t.co/y49Z8YfRgV — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 30, 2016

Republican candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich told NBC's Chuck Todd that there should ""absolutely not"" be punishments for a woman if abortion was outlawed. He also said he would support outlawing the procedure, with exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or women whose lives were in danger.

""Of course, women shouldn't be punished,"" he said. ""Probably Donald Trump will figure out a way to say that he didn't say it or it was misquoted or whatever, but I don't think so. I don't think that's an appropriate response.""

""And it's a difficult enough situation, and to try to punish somebody,"" he added, trailing off.

Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, released a statement saying Donald Trump obviously ""wants to ban abortion, criminalize doctors, and is threatening women.""

“But let’s be clear: Donald Trump has said it, Ted Cruz has voted for it, and John Kasich has enacted it. The Republican Party’s leadership has been waging a full-out assault on access to reproductive health care,"" she said, adding, ""The more these Republican candidates show their true beliefs, the more voters they alienate.”

Trump's words didn't go over well with the head of one of the largest anti-abortion groups, either. Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, issued a statement calling the comment ""completely out of touch with the pro-life movement and even more with women who have chosen such a sad thing as abortion.""

""Being pro-life means wanting what is best for the mother and the baby,"" she said. ""Women who choose abortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision. No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about. We invite a woman who has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not punishment.""

This story has been updated to include Trump's later statement, comments from his supporters at a town hall, and comments from Laguens.

699252269414354944,non-rumor,A Eulogy For the Show that Changed Kids' TV Forever: #GravityFalls https://t.co/djjK5noHYs https://t.co/yqWbLE1M4f,http://goo.gl/yRIfS0,True,A Eulogy For Gravity Falls,"Valentine’s Day Weekend is supposed to be spent with your significant other,or alone on your couch with a pint of ice cream. I did neither of those things. Instead, I spent my weekend with Gravity Falls, the Disney XD cartoon to which I bade farewell with a marathon of binge-watching before tonight’s series finale at 7:00 p.m. Eastern. Maybe my live tweeting of the action brought you here, maybe not. Either way, I hope you’ll join me in paying my last respects to a television show that changed children’s cartoons forever.

I was lucky enough to have been introduced to Gravity Falls last summer, when I visited my cousin in Prague and she could not stop raving about it. After the first two episodes I was hooked, and then I was binge-watching the show in the span of a few days, and then I was getting a Dipper Pines hat for my birthday. Evidence that I’m not simply a manchild for behaving this way: even the great Louis C.K. liked the show enough to agree to voice a disembodied head with an arm sticking out of the top. And how about the extensive list of guest stars and presumed fans, which includes Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Nathan Fillion, and freaking Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like so many others hip to this great show, I believe that the notion of a “kids’ cartoon” being exclusively for kids is bullshit, and Gravity Falls is absolutely worth your while, regardless of your tastes.

Gravity Falls’ strength, like that of any truly memorable show, has always been its characters —starting with Dipper and Mabel Pines, the 12-year-old co-protagonists. Their twin sibling relationship is, as far as I can tell, unique in animated protagonist history. On the surface, they seem a cut-and-dried case of the odd couple, with Dipper’s neuroticism, pubertal-onset insecurity, and analytical mind the foil to Mabel’s unfiltered joie de vivre and doe-eyed naïveté (portrayed magnificently by Kristen Schaal, whose performances highlight most of the episodes).

Plenty of fictional friends have showcased this dynamic, and they’ve all faced the archetypal challenge to such a relationship: overcoming the gap with love. But because Dipper and Mabel are twins, that love is closely intertwined with duty, which makes for a far more powerful bond. With duty come honesty, candor, and an intimate knowledge of each other’s deepest insecurities and flaws—all of which renders Dipper and Mabel totally vulnerable before each other. We get to see the inner psyches of the Pines twins in a way that no other show could ever reveal, because they’re each an X-ray into the other’s soul without any hint of romantic subtext (unless you’re a truly perverted DeviantArtist).

Mabel unlocks and elicits the pureness of Dipper’s heart, which often gets obscured by the ambitions and secret crushes that most guys deal with on a daily basis; in turn, Dipper unlocks and assuages Mabel’s deep-seated fear of change and the passage of time. Who else but Mabel could’ve convinced Dipper to declare his love for Wendy Corduroy, the coolest teenage girl who ever lived, knowing that it was futile and that he would have his heart ripped out in one of the show’s most visceral yet touching scenes? Who else but Dipper could’ve coaxed Mabel out of a fantasyland to rejoin a freak-show reality, rife with death, the ultimate human terror? These are heavy issues with which Hirsch and company have trusted their young audience—issues they can broach in an especially effective way because of Dipper and Mabel—and that trust 1.) has made Gravity Falls an amazing influence on children, and 2.) allowed it to resonate with an older audience.

Of course, Dipper and Mabel aren’t the only standout characters in Gravity Falls. There’s the well-intentioned, buffoonish handyman Soos, whose care for his Abuelita and non-relationship with his father humanize him in a way that stock clown characters have rarely been humanized in animated programs. There’s the über-cool Wendy Corduroy, the show’s superhero and Dipper’s crush, who showcases an incredible range of badassery while still acting like a real teenager (watching her break down at the end of “Boyz Crazy” is so brutal). And then there’s the kids’ Grunkle Stan, the most heartbreaking and dynamic character on the show. His transformation from narcissistic con man to outstanding father figure gains unfathomable depth when we find out that he’s been living with the guilt of having trapped his twin brother Ford on the other side of an interdimensional portal—and when Ford proves himself reckless, self-centered, and myopically focused on scientific inquiry, Stan doubles down on a devotion to Dipper and Mabel’s well-being.

“Everything I’ve worked for, everything I care about, it’s all for this family,” he proclaims in the seminal episode Not What He Seems. In hindsight, I’m eerily reminded of Walter White, and in a way, Stan’s arc reverses that of the meth kingpin; he must regain the trust of his kids, and he does so by becoming a better person and putting them ahead of his business. Many people are predicting that Stan will die in tonight’s series finale—someone will almost certainly die, because Hirsch has no reason to keep everyone alive—and if that turns out to be true, he will have completed his redemption story for the ages in the most tragic of fashions. I, for one, want to see a Disney story finally end in such an all-too-human Pyrrhic victory, and Gravity Falls has proven itself a brave enough kids’ program to make that a strong possibility.

Had Gravity Falls merely constructed brilliant characters for a brilliant world, it likely would’ve garnered critical praise and not much else. But the show blossomed into a full-blown cultural force because it knew to pull on the three cornerstones that go into building a modern cult classic:

1. Thinly veiled adult humor and trippy visuals;

2. Nostalgic references to the ‘90s;

3. Getting the fan base involved.

The first of these happened almost right off the bat when Mabel went for a trip on Smile Dip in “The Inconveniencing,” the show’s third episode, and “ONWARDS AOSHIMA” took over the Internet.

Since then, we’ve seen plenty of dirty jokes and faux-hallucinations (cracks at Dipper’s Internet history, Multi-Bears who like ABBA knock-offs, talking golf balls voiced by Patton Oswalt), but an underrated aspect of Gravity Falls’ appeal has been its willingness to depict legitimately horrifying scenes. Watching town oligarch Preston Northwest’s face get rearranged probably gave some kids nightmares that last to this day. You could probably make the argument that Gravity Falls is the Guillermo Del Toro of kids’ cartoons—and in fact Del Toro himself has lauded the show.

Add in cultural callouts like a boy band that turns out to be test tube clones (voiced by Lance Bass), a blatant homage to Mortal Kombat and Street Fighters called Fight Fighters, and an alternate Dipper named Dippy Fresh (the ‘90s personified), and you have the recipe for a show that will blow up the millennial-driven internets. One glance at the Gravity Falls subreddit is enough to showcase the passion of the show’s adult fans. Or you can look up “Dipcifica” to see just how seriously they’ve taken shipping Dipper with the town’s Regina George analogue, Pacifica Northwest. (Not sure how I feel about that.)

And Hirsch has run with all of this. He’s put ciphers at the end of every episode. He’s tossed in Easter eggs that only the keenest-eyed fans would spot (and they unfailingly have done so). Most notably, he established a mysterious wheel that the community has been debating for the better part of the past two years. It probably means something, and that meaning will probably be revealed tonight, but who knows? The point is, it got the people going. Gravity Falls has had the type of fan engagement most shows would kill for, and that’s going to keep it relevant for decades to come—true fandom doesn’t die.

But tonight, Gravity Falls comes to an end, a revelation that came as a surprise to the world when Hirsch announced it a couple months ago. To me, though, it marked, perhaps, the most beautiful moment in the show’s history: Hirsch knows his story is over. He’s not going to bother extending it only to weather an inevitable decline, or suffer listlessness. “Summer ends,” Dipper tells a distraught Mabel as she hides in her sweater at the end of “Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future,” and that’s the thesis statement of the entire series. Time passes, and with its passage come heartbreak and the loss of innocence… but ultimately we end up wiser and more able to appreciate the joys of the world. Now, with the psychopathic Bill Cipher looming and a very real threat of death to the heroes who will try to take him down, all that remains is to kiss this amazing series goodbye—to let it go out with a bang, and some tears.

And then marathon the entire thing again.

'We are all so devastated': acting world pays tribute to Alan Rickman Read more

Alan Rickman, one of the best-loved and most warmly admired British actors of the past 30 years, has died in London aged 69. His death was confirmed on Thursday by his family who said that he died “surrounded by family and friends”. Rickman had been suffering from cancer.

A star whose arch features and languid diction were recognisable across the generations, Rickman found a fresh legion of fans with his role as Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films.

Cast and crew on those movies were among the first to pay tribute to the actor. In a lengthy post, Daniel Radcliffe wrote that Rickman was “one of the greatest actors I will ever work with” as well as “one of the loyalest and most supportive people I’ve ever met in the film industry”.

JK Rowling, who wrote the Harry Potter books, said: “There are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman’s death. He was a magnificent actor & a wonderful man”, while Michael Gambon, who played Dumbledore, said: “Everybody loved Alan. He was always happy and fun and creative and very, very funny.”

The actor had been a big-screen staple since first shooting to global acclaim in 1988, when he starred as Hans Gruber, Bruce Willis’s sardonic, dastardly adversary in Die Hard – a part he was offered two days after arriving in Los Angeles, aged 41.

Gruber was the first of three memorable baddies played by Rickman: he was an outrageous sheriff of Nottingham in 1991’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, as well as a terrifying Rasputin in an acclaimed 1995 HBO film.

But Rickman was also a singular leading man: in 1991, he starred as a cellist opposite Juliet Stevenson in Anthony Minghella’s affecting supernatural romance Truly, Madly, Deeply; four years later he was the honourable and modest Col Brandon in Sense and Sensibility, starring and scripted by Emma Thompson. He was to reunite with Thompson many times: they played husband and wife in 2003’s Love, Actually and former lovers in 2010 BBC drama The Song of Lunch.

In 1995, he directed Thompson and her mother, Phyllida Law, in his directorial debut, the acclaimed Scottish drama The Winter Guest. Thompson – who said she had “just kissed him goodbye” – wrote:

What I remember most in this moment of painful leave-taking is his humour, intelligence, wisdom and kindness. His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word. The intransigence which made him the great artist he was – his ineffable and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me, and the fact that he never spared me the view. I learned a lot from him. He was the finest of actors and directors. I couldn’t wait to see what he was going to do with his face next. I consider myself hugely privileged to have worked with him so many times and to have been directed by him. He was the ultimate ally. In life, art and politics. I trusted him absolutely. He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again.

Last year, Rickman reunited with Kate Winslet, another Sense and Sensibility co-star, for his second film as director, A Little Chaos – a period romance set in the gardens of Versailles.

Yet it was Rickman’s work on stage that established him as such a compelling talent, and to which he returned throughout his career. After graduating from Rada, the actor supported himself as a dresser for the likes of Nigel Hawthorne and Ralph Richardson before finding work with the Royal Shakespeare Company (as well as on TV as the slithery Reverend Slope in The Barchester Chronicles).

His sensational breakthrough came in 1986 as Valmont, the mordant seducer in Christopher Hampton’s Les Liaisons Dangereuses. He was nominated for a Tony for the part; Lindsay Duncan memorably said of her co-star’s sonorous performance that audiences would leave the theatre wanting to have sex “and preferably with Alan Rickman”.

He and Duncan – as well as their director, Howard Davies – reunited in 2002 for Noel Coward’s Private Lives, which transferred to Broadway after a successful run in London.

Other key stage performances included Mark Antony opposite Helen Mirren’s Cleopatra at the Olivier Theatre in London, and the title role in Ibsen’s John Gabriel Borkman at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 2010 – again with Duncan, and again transferring to New York. The following year he starred as a creative writing professor in Seminar on Broadway.

In 2005, Rickman directed the award-winning play My Name is Rachel Corrie, which he and Katharine Viner – now Guardian editor-in-chief – compiled from the emails of the student who was killed by a bulldozer while protesting against the actions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Gaza Strip.

Rickman remained politically active throughout his life: he was born, he said, “a card-carrying member of the Labour party”, and was highly involved with charities including Saving Faces and the International Performers’ Aid Trust, which seeks to help artists in developing and poverty-stricken countries.

Rickman publicly spoke of his unhappiness about the “Hollywood ending” of 1996 film Michael Collins, a historical biopic of the Irish civil war, in which he portrayed Éamon de Valera, and expressed his belief that art ought to help educate as well as entertain. “Talent is an accident of genes, and a responsibility,” he once said.

He and his wife, Rima Horton, met when they were still teenagers; she became an economics lecturer as well as a Labour party councillor. In 2012, the pair married, having been together since 1965. The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was one of the first to pay tribute on Twitter, followed by former leader Ed Miliband.

Others offering condolences included Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard, Charlie Sheen, Mia Farrow and Richard E Grant. Many drew parallels between the deaths of Rickman and David Bowie, from the same disease at the same age and in the same week.

Rickman was an actor unafraid of the unexpected. He voiced a monarch in an episode of cult cartoon King of the Hill and a megalomaniac pilot fish called Joe in the Danish animator Help! I’m A Fish. In 2000, Rickman appeared as Sharleen Spiteri’s love interest in the music video for Texas’s 2000 hit ‘In Demand’, which involves them tangoing at a petrol station. In 2015, Rickman again featured in the video for one of their singles, this time with vocals.



He spoofed his own persona in comedy Galaxy Quest (2000), in which he plays a Shakespearian-trained actor who has found fame as a Spock-style alien in a long-running sci-fi series and in Victoria Wood’s Christmas special of the same year, as an upright colonel at the Battle of Waterloo.



Rickman was sanguine about his legions of admirers, who declared their love on countless websites, video tributes and at stage doors. Even scientists were not immune: in 2008, linguistics professors concluded that the most appealing male voice mixes elements of Rickman, Gambon and Jeremy Irons.

Recent film roles included an art-loving lord in the Coen brothers’ scripted farce Gambit (2012), as Ronald Reagan in Lee Daniels’s The Butler – and a humorous, imperious King Louis XIV in A Little Chaos.

Rickman is still to be seen in Eye in the Sky, a thriller about drone warfare that won rave reviews at the Toronto film festival last year, and repeating his voiceover as Absolem the Caterpillar in Alice Through the Looking Glass, also due for release later this year.

His final job was taping a voiceover for a short film called This Tortoise Could Save a Life, in aid of Save the Children and Refugee Council. Released in mid December 2015, the film’s audio was recorded at Rickman’s home in London at the end of November.

That Rickman never won an Oscar (he did receive a Golden Globe, an Emmy, a Bafta and many more) became a perennial topic in interviews but did not seem to trouble the actor himself. “Parts win prizes, not actors,” he said in 2008. It was the wider worth of his art to which Rickman remained committed, saying that he found it easier to treat the work seriously if he could look upon himself with levity.

“Actors are agents of change,” he said. “A film, a piece of theatre, a piece of music, or a book can make a difference. It can change the world.”

Mariam Al Mansouri's participation in F-16 bombing raids for the UAE was celebrated in the West, but an anonymous statement claiming to be from her family 'disowned' her for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria.

It also expressed support for the Islamic State, saying 'we are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant'. The brutal terrorist group's original name was the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isil.

Courageous: Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She's pictured here in an F-16 Desert Eagle

Major Al Mansouri's F-16 fighter was one of several from a group of Arab nations that are blitzing Isis

THE STATEMENT IN FULL In the name of God All Merciful. 'O ye who believe! Take not your fathers or your brethren for friends if they favour disbelief over faith. Those of you who taketh them for friends are wrong-doers.' [Quranic verse] 'Renouncement of Mariam Al Mansouri: 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. 'We hereby remind the Muslim nation all over the world of its duty to defend the causes of the nation [meaning the Islamic nation], and we urge them to take up the jihad [holy war] for the sake of God to support the blessed Syrian revolution against the descendants of Ibn Al Alqami.' [Sunni Islamist insurgents refer to the Shi'a as 'alqami' - a reference to Mu'ayyad al-Din Muhammad Ibn al-Alqami, a Shi'ite minister in the last Abbasid caliphate, who purportedly assisted the Mongols in conquering Baghdad in 1258.] 'We call upon all factions and battalions operating on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime perched on the pure and blessed Syrian land. 'Al Mansouri family, in the UAE and abroad, takes this opportunity to declare its support for the blessed Syrian revolution and to all free men defending their rights everywhere in the world. 'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [The Islamic Nation}. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. We may not know them, but God knows them and would champion them. 'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. All the honourable members of our family have agreed to this statement. 'Al Mansouri family.'

The statement also expressed support for the Syrian revolution, according to the Palestinian Wattan news agency.

It said: 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri.

'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri.'

It continued: 'We call upon all factions... on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime.

'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [the Islamic Nation]. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be.'

It's not clear whether the views expressed in the statement represent those of the entire family or indeed if it is genuine.

The Mansouri tribe has some influential members, including the country's economics minister, but it's also very large – the second biggest in Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE, so it certainly can't be assumed that the views expressed in the statement are representative of the whole group.

The statement could well have been made anonymously out of fear of punishment, as voicing dissent against the UAE government can result in imprisonment.

If true, the statement won't represent the first time the Mansouri family has been linked to extremism.

In January this year high-profile lawyer Mohammed al-Mansoori was jailed for allegedly trying to set up an 'international' branch of the controversial Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE, according to the BBC.

Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander.

She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature.

The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers.

She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.'

She says that her nearest relatives are supportive of her role in the air force.

There was also no difference between men and women with regards to training and assignments, she said.

'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence,'

Earlier this week Fox News host Eric Bolling apologised for calling Major Mansouri's missions as 'boobs on the ground'.

FOX NEWS HOST ERIC BOLLING APOLOGISES FOR SEXIST 'BOOBS ON THE GROUND' JOKE ABOUT FEMALE FIGHTER A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five. During a segment about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria, Eric Bolling referred to her mission as 'boobs on the ground.' Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized. 'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today. 'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.' This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon. 'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said. 'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.' Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force. 'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued. 'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them. Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes.

It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark on Friday joined the U.S.-led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes on Isis.

The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency.

Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.'

'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a `walk on by' option.

There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.'

Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq.

That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria.

British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result.

524998384357486592,true,Canadian government offices are locked down in Ottawa after an armed attack: http://t.co/78zyWAgGfF http://t.co/CFHMVlSAsT,http://on.wsj.com/1tfMp7g,True,Two Dead in Canada Shootings,"A gunman fatally shot a Canadian soldier before being killed in a shootout in the Canadian Parliament building. WSJ's Eva Tam reports.

A man fatally shot a soldier at Canada’s National War Memorial before being killed inside the country’s Parliament building, in a terror attack that shut down the capital city and stands to change the way Canada protects itself.

Armed officers combed Canada’s Parliament building and surrounding areas for potential other shooters for much of the day, forcing Ottawa’s core into a lockdown mode into the evening, when police said there was no further threat to public safety there.

Canadian Officials on Investigation Ottawa officials and police provide an update on the armed attack at Canada’s main war memorial that left two men dead as parliament remained locked down.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper, speaking from an undisclosed location, said in a televised address “in the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had.”

The attack on what he termed “a sacred place” served as a “grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the attacks that happened around the world.”

The killer was identified by U.S. authorities as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, who they said was born Michael Joseph Hall but changed his name as part of a conversion to Islam. Officials didn’t offer a motive.

Earlier in the day, lawmakers huddled in Parliament offices for hours, with some still under lockdown at nightfall. Students were required to stay in their school buildings in the usually quiet city, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers warned residents to stay off roofs and away from windows.

The shooting occurred as Canada was already on heightened alert after two soldiers were run over on Monday in Quebec by a Canadian man whom authorities were investigating for terror links.

It also happened just a day after Ottawa dispatched warplanes to the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State militants, a move that the country’s main intelligence agency had earlier warned would increase the threat of terror attacks in Canada.

The shooting in Canada amplified unease around Western capitals over their citizens’ vulnerability at home during a time of heightened alerts over potential terror attacks.

President Barack Obama said Wednesday the attack underscored the importance to the U.S. “to recognize that when it comes to dealing with terrorist activity, that Canada and the United States have to be entirely in sync.”

The U.S. Army increased security at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery as a precautionary measure, as government buildings across Canada also tightened their security.

Scenes on television of fatigue-clad police officers streaming down Ottawa’s streets with automatic weapons shocked a capital city with one of the lowest crime rates in a country where the rate of firearm-related murder is a fraction of that in the U.S.

Raw video: Officers walk slowly through Canada’s Parliament Wednesday following a shooting at the Ottawa war memorial. The sound of a gunshot rings out, followed by the sounds of multiple shots as police started crouching and firing.

Experts described the attack as a major failure in security, in which up to 30 shots were fired within Parliament’s main building, and one that could starkly alter the way that Canada deals with such threats.

“We should have been prepared. This rightly should be considered a monumental failure of security,” said Mubin Shaikh, a former undercover operative for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Service.

“The threat evolves, the adversary adapts and we don’t,” said Mr. Shaikh. “There will be a seismic shift in Canada regarding security preparations and protocols.”

The lapse in security comes a day after police admitted they had been monitoring the man responsible for Monday’s attack, Martin Rouleau, since June and met him as recently as Oct. 9.

The shooting started just before 10 a.m., when a man opened fire on the ceremonial guard standing beside the National War Memorial, which honors Canadian forces’ service abroad. A witness said she heard four shots and saw a person running away with a rifle.

Medics could be seen attending to a person on the ground near the memorial.

The soldier, who was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, was taken away in an ambulance and died of his wounds.

When the first shots rang out, Marc-Andre Viau, press secretary for the opposition New Democratic Party, was outside Parliament ahead of a scheduled caucus meeting. A couple of minutes earlier, he had heard police about 20 yards away tell bystanders to take cover; to his right, a woman who had dropped to the ground began to cry, saying her children were in the Parliament building. Then the first shots were fired.

Mr. Viau said he took cover by a wall. A few seconds later, he saw someone running away with heavily armed police in pursuit.

Alberta Labor Minister Ric McIver was crossing a nearby street when he heard multiple shots.

He saw a brown Toyota pull up near where he was crossing the street, and a man in his mid-40s wearing a three-quarters-length jacket exit the car with a rifle in his hand.

Mr. McIver said the man ran toward the main Parliament building, known as Centre Block. “My colleague said they must be doing a military ceremony. And then I saw a guy in a uniform running in a very fast way. I said, ‘No, something really bad has happened,’ ” Mr. McIver said.

Inside Parliament, Quebec lawmaker Mylene Freeman was waiting for her New Democratic Party’s weekly caucus meeting to begin when she heard shots.

“We hid under tables, up against the walls and blocked the doors,” she said of the panicked moments that followed. Minutes later, parliamentary security guards divided Ms. Freeman and her colleagues into groups and helped them to safety.

As Parliament was locked down and word of the shooting spread, lawmakers stuck in Parliament offices sent messages on Twitter describing the gunfire and their fear. Tony Clement, a senior cabinet minister, tweeted that at least 30 shots were fired. “I’m safe with two colleagues but we’re still at risk,” he wrote as the events unfolded.

Armed police officers were seen entering the offices of the prime minister. A large section of the street in front of Parliament was closed off and being patrolled by officers in green fatigues carrying automatic weapons.

While the sequence of events is unclear, the House of Commons’ Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Vickers, a 29-year veteran of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, shot the suspect, according to people familiar with the matter.

After police confirmed the deaths of the shooter and began lifting the Parliamentary lockdown in midafternoon, hundreds of public servants began walking south, away from Parliament Hill. Some were seen hugging and comforting each other.

U.S. officials have long regarded U.S. security as dependent on Canada’s, given that terrorists could fly anywhere in North America and make their way across the border into the U.S.

For that reason, U.S. and Canadian security officials have worked closely on monitoring travel by extremists.

However, if the Canadian attack turns out to be a so-called homegrown threat, it could challenge the assumption that the best way to prevent terrorist attacks is to prevent terrorists from coming to North America.

The bulk of U.S. counterterrorism efforts have focused on marshaling intelligence and military means to find and sometimes capture or kill terrorists overseas—or tracking any U.S. links they might have and arresting them or their co-conspirators in America.

“Those tools cannot be applied to threats that originate domestically,” said John Cohen, a former top counterterrorism official at the Homeland Security Department who now works at Rutgers University.

Ms. Freeman, the Quebec lawmaker, said the events of the day would leave a lasting mark.

“Honestly I have never thought this kind of thing could happen here,” she said. “As a Canadian [lawmaker] I have always felt very secure in my work. But all that changed after I heard those shots fired. It’s going to be very different here from now on.”

""We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,"" Harper said before vowing that the attack would ""lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts"" to keep the country safe and work with Canada's allies to fight terrorists.

The assault rocked Parliament over and over with the boom of gunfire, led MPs to barricade doors with chairs and sent people streaming from the building in fear. Harper was addressing a caucus when the attack began outside the door, but he safely escaped. He gave his address Wednesday evening from an undisclosed location.

Earlier Wednesday, Canadian authorities identified the shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32. A government official told Fox News that they have been advised that Zehaf-Bibeau, a Quebec native, was thought to be a recent convert to Islam who had changed his name from Michael Joseph Hall. Investigators offered little additional information about the gunman. However, Harper said in his address that ""in the days to come we will learn about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had.""

Court records that appear to be the gunman's show that he had a long rap sheet, with a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes.

The shooting, which triggered a lockdown of Canada's capital, came just two days after a deadly hit-and-run terror attack targeting soldiers in Quebec by a man the Prime Minister referred to as an ""ISIL-inspired terrorist."" That killer, also identified as a convert to Islam, had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey.

ISIL, better known as Islamic State or ISIS, has called for reprisals against Canada and other Western countries that have joined the U.S.-led air campaign against the extremist group in Iraq and Syria. On Tuesday, Canada had raised its domestic terror level from low to medium due to ""an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations like ISIL, Al Qaeda, al-Shabab and others who pose a clear threat to Canadians,"" said Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for the public safety minister.

Counter-terrorism investigators are reviewing Zehaf-Bibeau's social media traffic and profile, with a focus on any link to Monday's attack, which killed one soldier and injured another.

The Toronto Globe and Mail said sources had told the paper Zehaf-Bibeau was recently designated a “high-risk traveler” by the Canadian government and his passport had been seized.

By Wednesday night, three persons who had been taken to Ottawa Hospital with minor injuries were all released.

The first shots rang out just before 10 a.m., when a guard at the National War Monument was fatally shot. The gunman next ran into the Parliament Hill building, where one MP reported hearing as many as 30 shots fired and a sergeant at arms was later credited with shooting the suspect dead. In the following moments and hours, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on the scene, more shots were reported less than a mile away near a mall and officials told Ottawa residents to barricade themselves in their homes as they searched for more possible gunmen.

Police said in the initial hours that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part in the attacks. But by late in the evening, the cordon around Parliament was lifted and police said there was no longer any threat to the public in the area.

""We're still in the process of clearing Parliament Hill. It is a slow and methodical process,"" Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau said Wednesday afternoon.

The shooting at the government complex came after witnesses said they saw at least oneman jump out of a Toyota Corolla and run toward the memorial and open fire on the soldier, who later died at Civic Hospital. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had video of the gunman going to his car alone with his weapon after the shooting at the memorial. The car was later spotted parked in front of Parliament Hill, just down the block.

The soldier was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, according to his aunt, the Globe and Mail reported. Cirillo was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a regiment of Reserve Forces based in Hamilton, according to the Globe, and was training to join the Canada Border Services Agency.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the member and his loved ones,"" Bordeleau said.

After shooting the guard, the gunman ran to the Parliament building and unleashed a flurry of shots in the building, where witnesses later said they saw a man down near the library. Bernard Trottier, a Toronto-area MP, tweeted that the gunman inside Centre Block ""has been shot and killed.”

Veteran Affairs Minister Julian Fantino told QMI Agency that Parliament’s sergeant-at-arms, Kevin Vickers, shot the gunman dead.

“All the details are not in, but the sergeant-at-arms, a former Mountie, is the one that engaged the gunman, or one of them at least, and stopped this,” Fantino said from inside Centre Block. “He did a great job and, from what I know, shot the gunman and he is now deceased.”

President Obama called the shooting ""tragic"" and expressed condolences to the family of the guard. The FBI was working with Canadian authorities to identify the source and extent of the threat and the U.S. embassy was placed on lockdown following the shootings, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. The Pentagon authorized additional security at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, as well.

""We are following the active shooter situation in Ottawa near the National War Memorial and Parliament,"" Harf said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. We have full confidence in Canadian law enforcement officials. [U.S. Secretary of State John] Kerry who's on his plane on the way back from Berlin has been briefed on the situation and is following it closely.""

After the shootings, officials canceled two events in Toronto honoring Pakistani teenager and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, including one in which she was supposed to receive honorary Canadian citizenship. She was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in 2012 for supporting schooling for girls.

Witnesses told the Globe and Mail the Parliament Hill building was locked down and police ordered journalists to shelter in the foyer in front of the House of Commons. Members of Parliament also took cover in the building, tweeting from inside the building.

At the memorial, emergency responders were seen performing CPR on the shooting victim.

Tony Zobl said he witnessed the Canadian soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency. ""The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""

Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, told CBC that he saw a man running with a double-barreled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans. Walsh said the man hopped over the fence that surrounded Parliament Hill and forced someone out of their car, then drove to the front doors of the Parliament building and fired at least two shots.

A Canadian official told Fox News witnesses described the shooter as having long, dark curly hair and a tan complexion and said he was wearing a white bandana and white hoodie. They said there was no license plate on the Toyota Corolla.

Public buildings near Parliament, including Ottawa City Hall, the University of Ottawa and primary schools were locked down. The Rideau Centre Mall, a block from the war memorial, was also locked down after a report of shots fired nearby, although a spokeswoman said no shooting occurred inside.

[""Ottawa Police] asked us to lock down,"" she said in an e-mail to the Globe and Mail. ""We did. We have no further comment.”

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said ""our thoughts and prayers are with those injured.”

“As with all Ottawa residents and all Canadians, I am shocked and saddened by what has happened in the last hour here in the nation’s capital,” he said in a statement.

509464271118688257,true,Source: Microsoft in discussions to buy 'Minecraft' maker Mojang for more than $2 billion - @WSJ http://t.co/zLcx3Ozcpu,http://on.wsj.com/1lR9USL,True,Microsoft Near Deal to Buy Minecraft Maker Mojang,"Microsoft is in talks to acquire Swedish game company, Mojang. If the $2 billion deal for the maker of Minecraft goes through, the mobs, skeletons, zombies — and most importantly — the company's customer base of more than 50 million, would give Microsoft access to a young, hip demographic it has struggled to attract.

Microsoft Corp. MSFT 2.32% is in serious discussions to buy Mojang AB, the Swedish company behind the popular ""Minecraft"" videogame, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

The deal would be valued at more than $2 billion and could be signed as early as this week, the person said. A Microsoft spokesman declined comment, as did Mojang Chief Executive Carl Manneh.

A sale would be a surprising turn for closely held Mojang, whose 35-year-old founder, Markus Persson, has shunned outside investment and is revered in the videogame community for railing publicly against big firms, including Microsoft.

Programmers worked in Mojang's office in Stockholm last year. Reuters

Meanwhile, ""Minecraft"" could reinvigorate Microsoft's 13-year-old Xbox videogame business by giving it a cult hit with a legion of young fans. Mojang has sold over 50 million copies of ""Minecraft"" since it was initially released in 2009 and earned more than $100 million in profit last year from the game and merchandise. The game is already available on Xbox, as well as on Sony Corp.'s PlayStation, PCs and smartphones.

The popularity of ""Minecraft"" rests in large part on its open-ended possibilities, letting players build just about anything in a blocky, Lego-style world filled with dangers such as zombies and giant spiders. The game has struck a chord with children and hard-core gamers alike despite pixilated graphics that are a far cry from polished, action-based blockbusters like Microsoft's own ""Halo"" franchise.

The brand has also grown beyond videogames, striking licensing deals with Scholastic Corp. for handbooks, Lego A/S for toys and Warner Bros. Pictures for a feature film. There is even a popular edition for schools to teach children such subjects as languages and architecture.

Mojang would be the first multibillion-dollar acquisition by Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, since he was named to the top job in February. It would also be an unexpected plunge because he has signaled Xbox isn't a core business for Microsoft.

But Mr. Nadella has said that Microsoft views videogames as a way to expand the company's footholds in PCs and mobile phones. In a letter to employees in July, Mr. Nadella called gaming the ""single biggest digital life category, measured in both time and money spent, in a mobile-first world.""

That message was a rebuttal to critics who said videogames are an expensive and nonstrategic diversion for the company, which makes roughly two-thirds of its gross profit selling software for corporate technology departments. By contrast, the business that includes Xbox consoles had sales of roughly $6.7 billion in the year ended June 30, or about 8% of Microsoft's total revenue for the period.

""Minecraft"" could also help Microsoft appeal to a new generation of customers, especially on smartphones where Microsoft has struggled with both its homegrown Windows Phone devices and with apps on rival phone systems.

Only Microsoft's Skype video-calling service is fairly consistently among the 50 top free or paid apps for iPhone or Android smartphones in the U.S., according to mobile-app tracker App Annie.

""Minecraft"" is ranked in the top five among U.S. paid apps in the Apple and Google app stores.

The game has also become an integral part of a growing trend to watch game play on video sites such as YouTube and Twitch, which was acquired by Amazon.com Inc. for close to $1 billion. Several ""Minecraft"" players on YouTube have attracted more than a billion views for their videos.

In the world of games, Stockholm-based Mojang is an outlier, generating outsize profits relative to its small staff.

In contrast to larger game companies such as Zynga Inc. and Electronic Arts Inc., which employ thousands of people to manage dozens of titles, Mojang has deliberately remained small, employing only about 40 people in its studio in Stockholm's hip Södermalm district.

Yet Mojang made a profit of 816 Swedish kroner ($115 million) last year on 2.07 billion kroner in revenue ($291 million). Zynga, which has roughly 3,000 employees, had a $37 million loss last year on $873 million in revenue.

Instead of giving its game away and charging for in-app purchases, as many newer game makers do, Mojang charges flat fees for its games. The Xbox version costs $20, while a download on a PC is $27 and the mobile version is $7.

""Minecraft"" started out as a hobby project in 2009, when Mr. Persson—a high-school dropout and former game developer at ""Candy Crush"" game maker King Digital Entertainment PLC—spent the summer in his small apartment in Stockholm coding what would one day become a global phenomenon.

""Notch,"" as he is known online to his fans, was obsessed by Lego bricks as a child, and had begun programming on his father's Commodore 128 computer at the age of seven, producing his first game at the age of eight.

Mr. Persson made an early and unfinished build of the game available to download, but sales started out modestly with only a handful sold a day for the first few months.

Slowly, ""Minecraft"" gained momentum as word-of-mouth and online recommendations started spreading. By 2010, copies of the game were selling fast enough for Mr. Persson to quit his day job.

Mr. Persson established Mojang in 2010 to manage ""Minecraft"" and build other games, bringing along former King colleague Jakob Porsér and Mr. Manneh, the CEO. The three are still the company's only shareholders and board members.

Mojang's relationship with Microsoft hasn't been without friction. In 2012, Mr. Persson made harsh statements on Twitter about the U.S. software giant and its new Windows 8 operating system, telling Microsoft to ""stop trying to ruin the PC.""

""Minecraft"" can be played on personal computers running Windows 8, but that requires that users download it from Mojang's site rather than Microsoft's own Windows Store. What's more, the game has never been made available for Windows Phone, Microsoft's operating system for phones, because Mojang deemed the platform too small to be worth the while.

Mojang has embraced Microsoft's Xbox gaming console, and it released a first version of the game for the Xbox 360 in 2012, more than a year before Sony's rival PlayStation 3 console got it. A version for the new Xbox One was made available last week. The console versions of ""Minecraft"" accounted for almost a third of Mojang's revenue last year.

Mr. Persson has regularly thumbed his nose at large corporations with snarky tweets and blog posts. Earlier this year, he canceled a project to bring a version of the game for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset to protest Facebook Inc.'s $2 billion purchase of the company.

""Facebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts,"" he wrote on his blog at the time. ""There's nothing about their history that makes me trust them, and that makes them seem creepy to me,"" he added.

In another post published in June, Mr. Persson said Mojang ""does not exist to make as much money as possible for the owners."" Instead, he said, ""Mojang exists because I got lucky with 'Minecraft,' and it got way bigger than I could handle on my own.""

""Every time a big money-making deal comes up that would make a lot of money, it's of course very tempting,"" he added. ""But at the end of the day we choose to do what either makes the most sense for our products or the things that seem like fun for us at Mojang.""

Until now, Mojang's founders have prided themselves on the company's independence. Mojang has routinely dismissed funding overtures from venture-capital companies, as well as outright buyout attempts.

A tight ownership structure has meant that the company has been able to focus its operations, Mr. Manneh told the Journal earlier this year.

""Financially speaking, we have no pressure whatsoever to rush into any new projects,"" he said. ""Besides, we have no outside owners that require us to reach any particular goals.""

544512910538838016,unverified,"UPDATE: Hostages fleeing #Sydney cafe held by Iranian gunman as explosions, gunshots are heard: http://t.co/WrPVZSJHlX",http://fxn.ws/136llgw,True,"Police say 3 dead, including gunman, after raid ends Sydney hostage situation","Police say three people are dead -- including the gunman -- after authorities stormed a Sydney cafe early Tuesday, bringing to a dramatic end a 16-hour standoff in which a jihadist and murder suspect had held 17 hostages in a scene much of the world watched on television.

A series of explosions, believed to be gunshots and flash grenades, came just before 2:30 a.m. local time as several more hostages fled Lindt Chocolat Cafe, where a man identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian also known for sending hate mail to the families of fallen soldiers, was holed up with the captives. Authorities say Monis was shot and killed during the confrontation with police.

A 34-year-old man and 38-year-old woman also were among the dead, police said. Four people were injured in the raid, including a female hostage who was shot in the leg, an official told The Associated Press. One policeman, who suffered a gunshot wound in the face, is in good condition and is grateful to be alive, Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters at a press conference.

Several people were taken from the building on stretchers as an alarm rang and police in riot gear moved in and out of the shop, in the heart of Australia's largest city's business district. A bomb disposal robot was seen being deployed in the shop, though police said the standoff was over. Authorities later said no explosive devices were found.

The handful of hostages seen fleeing as the explosions echoed through the predawn air followed escapes hours earlier by five captives.

""Sydney siege is over. More details to follow"" New South Wales police posted on Twitter.

Scipione called the ordeal a ""distressing time"" for the families of those involved.

“We are strong together. We will get through this,"" added New South Wales Premier Mike Baird.

For hours, television news crews had broadcast footage of frightened hostages looking out through the front window. Initially, police did not identify Monis, though they knew he was the suspect inside. His identity was known early on to police and media alike, but was only released for the record by police sources as night fell on Sydney with the nation transfixed on the televised scene.

During the evening hours on Monday, several people were seen with their arms in the air and hands pressed against the glass, and two people were seen holding up a black flag associated with Islamic fanaticism. Australian broadcaster Network Ten reported that Monis, seen wielding a shotgun and a machete, has forced hostages to call him ""The Brother"" and demanded to speak directly with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

""The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass,"" Seven Network television news reporter Chris Reason said, according to The Associated Press. ""One woman we've counted was there for at least two hours -- an extraordinary, agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long.""

[image]

The drama began during the Monday morning rush hour and carried into night time in Australia's largest city. Five hostages escaped some six hours into the ordeal, running out a side door and into the arms of police, who have the shop surrounded. The shop is in Sydney's central business district in Martin Place, a plaza in the heart of the city's financial and shopping district that is packed with holiday shoppers this time of year. Shops in the area were closed and people were ordered to stay out.

A journalist on the scene tweeted that the terror suspect appeared to fly into a rage after the hostages escaped.

[pullquote]

""The gunman could be seen from here getting extremely agitated, shouting at remaining hostages,"" tweeted journalist Chris Reason.

Reason described Monis as unshaven, wearing a white shirt and a black cap, and holding what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun. He could be seen pacing back and forth past the cafe's four windows. Sky News described Monis as bearded, middle-aged and wearing a black and white headband. Sky cited reports that he is known to police and media outlets.

""Just two hours ago when we saw that rush of escapees, we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out. He started screaming orders at the people, the hostages who remain behind,"" Reason reported.

[image]

Monis, who reportedly emigrated to Australia in 1996, is known in Australia for his public campaign of writing letters to the families of fallen soldiers calling them “murderers” and urging the recipients to lobby the government to withdraw from Afghanistan. Haron was charged in 2009 with using the postal service to harass in a case he fought all the way to Australia’s highest court, which dismissed his appeal.

Last year, he was charged in connection with the murder of his ex-wife in a case that is pending as Monis is free on bail. He was charged earlier this year with sexual assault of a woman who went to his office in New South Wales for ""spiritual healing.""

""This is a one-off random individual. It's not a concerted terrorism event or act. It's a damaged goods individual who's done something outrageous,"" his former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness.""

Monis ran a website which was taken down shortly after he was named as the gunman in the hostage situation, Sky News reports. In a letter posted to the website, which he signed Sheikh Haron, he accused Australia, Britain and the U.S. of ""oppression and terrorism"" and posted images of dead children.

Monis also reportedly called for non-violent activism, writing that ""Islam is the religion of peace and a Muslim should be a peace activist.""

As night descended on Sydney, the lights inside the shop went off, but it was unclear if that was by the suspected jihadist's choice or if the police made the cafe go dark as a negotiating tactic. Earlier, the gunman appeared to be rotating frightened hostages in front of the window, holding up the black Islamist flag ""Shahada"" flag, an emblem of Jabhat al-Nusra, the Al Qaeda-linked terror group fighting - sometimes with, sometimes against - Islamic State in Syria.

The gunman was reportedly relaying threats and demands through two hostages, and claimed to have planted two bombs inside the cafe and two others elsewhere in Sydney's central business district.

Late Monday, Abbott released a pre-recorded statement calling the attack ""very disturbing"" and ""profoundly shocking."" His office didn't respond to the gunman's demands.

Three men were seen running from a fire exit of the cafe approximately six hours after the hostage situation began at 9:45 a.m. local time. Moments later, two women believed to be employees, followed suit. It was not immediately clear how the hostages escaped.

The U.S. Consulate, located just south of the cafe, was also evacuated and a warning issued urging Americans in Sydney to ""maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security."" A White House official told Fox News that President Obama had been briefed on the situation.

Lindt Australia posted a message on its Facebook page thanking the public for its support.

""We are deeply concerned over this serious incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the staff and customers involved and all their friends and families,"" the company wrote.

The government raised Australia's terror warning level in September in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group. Counterterror law enforcement teams later conducted dozens of raids and made several arrests in Australia's three largest cities -- Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. One man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney.

The Islamic State group, which now holds a third of Syria and Iraq, has threatened Australia in the past. In September, Islamic State group spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani issued an audio message urging so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks abroad, specifically mentioning Australia. Al-Adnani told Muslims to kill all ""disbelievers,"" whether they be civilians or soldiers.

692142338890661888,non-rumor,"Ex-New York Giants safety Tyler Sash, who died at 27, found to have degenerative brain disease C.T.E. -  NY Times https://t.co/LyGEcD8TNI",http://nyti.ms/1PzZe2U,True,"C.T.E. Is Found in an Ex-Giant Tyler Sash, Who Died at 27","Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine who conducted the examination, said Tuesday that the severity of the C.T.E. in Sash’s brain was about the same as the level found in the brain of the former N.F.L. star Junior Seau, who committed suicide in 2012 at age 43.

Doctors grade C.T.E. on a severity scale from 0 to 4; Sash was at Stage 2. McKee, comparing the results to other athletes who died at a similar age, said she had seen only one case, that of a 25-year-old former college player, with a similar amount of the disease.

The Sash family, who released the findings, said the outcome brought some clarity to the end of Tyler Sash’s life.

“My son knew something was wrong, but he couldn’t express it,” Barnetta Sash said Monday night. “He was such a good person, and it’s sad that he struggled so with this — not knowing where to go with it.”

She continued: “Now it makes sense. The part of the brain that controls impulses, decision-making and reasoning was damaged badly.”

McKee said that “very classic lesions of C.T.E.” were found in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and in the amygdala. The location of lesions has bearing on symptoms exhibited.

“It helps explain his inattention, his short fuse and his lack of focus,” McKee said.

McKee added: “Even though he was only 27, he played 16 years of football, and we’re finding over and over that it’s the duration of exposure to football that gives you a high risk for C.T.E. Certainly, 16 years is a high exposure.”

An autopsy revealed that the cause of Sash’s death was a lethal mixture of two powerful pain medications, methadone and hydrocodone. A medical examiner called the overdose “accidental drug toxicity,” adding that a recent shoulder dislocation and a history of chronic shoulder pain were “significant conditions” in the death.

Sash, a sixth-round draft pick of the Giants, was primarily a reserve for the team during two seasons, most notably during the team’s 2011 season, which ended with a Super Bowl victory. He played a total of 23 games plus four postseason games and was cut by the Giants weeks before the opener of the 2013 season, reaching an injury settlement after he sustained a concussion in the final game of the preseason.

In 2012, Sash was suspended for four games for violating the N.F.L.’s policy on performance-enhancing substances by testing positive for Adderall, a stimulant used primarily to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Sash said at the time that he had used the drug legally under a doctor’s orders to combat anxiety before a public speaking engagement but did not know it was on the league’s banned list.

At Iowa, Sash started 37 games from 2007 to 2010, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in his final season.

Sash came from a football family. His father, Michael, played in college and his brother, Josh, was a good enough high school player that he considered playing in college as well.

Josh Sash, eight years older than Tyler, said his brother sustained at least two concussions in high school, one documented concussion in college and two with the Giants, including one in the Giants’ playoff victory over the San Francisco 49ers that earned the team its berth in the Super Bowl after the 2011 season.

In the San Francisco game, Sash, who was 215 pounds, was blindsided by a brutal and borderline late hit on a punt return by a 281-pound defensive lineman.

“Those concussions are the ones we definitely know about,” Josh Sash said. “If you’ve played football, you know there are often other incidents.”

Experts believe that less severe blows to the head — those not strong enough to cause a concussion — also significantly contribute to the damage that results in C.T.E. These lesser traumas are especially troubling, neurologists say, because they happen frequently in contact sports like football but go undiagnosed.

Josh Sash, who has two young sons, said it would be difficult for him to recommend that his children play football when they grow older. Barnetta Sash, who said she had always loved football, felt similarly.

“I want other parents to realize they need to have a conversation with their kids and not just think it’s a harmless game — because it’s not,” said Barnetta Sash, whose daughter, Megan, has three children.

The N.F.L. has agreed to a court settlement with former players that would compensate them for severe neurological conditions. The settlement is being appealed. Sash’s family would not be eligible for a payment because only the families of players who died and were found to have had C.T.E. before the settlement was approved in April 2015 may receive compensation.

When Tyler Sash returned to Iowa after the Giants released him in 2013, Barnetta Sash said he hid his shoulder injury for some time because he still hoped to sign with another N.F.L. team. Both shoulders had been operated on in college.

“His shoulders were an ongoing problem; he couldn’t sleep on either shoulder,” said Barnetta, who said her son sometimes would go two days without sleeping because of the discomfort.

Tyler received a doctor’s prescription for hydrocodone and awaited doctors’ evaluations about surgery that could repair the shoulder. He worked at jobs doing menial labor but his shoulder was a constant problem, dislocating once as Sash took off his shirt.

In time, the Sash family noticed Tyler’s forgetfulness — he would sometimes repeat himself several times in a conversation. The family told Boston University doctors that Sash had headaches, lost his wallet several times and had trouble doing other routine tasks like composing or reading emails.

“He didn’t quite seem to be the same person he used to be,” Josh Sash said.

Barnetta Sash said Tyler had multiple offers for better-paying or higher-profile jobs.

“He couldn’t focus long enough to do a job,” Barnetta said.

Tyler talked to various people in his circle of friends and family about stories he had read of mental acuity issues, and C.T.E., in former football players.

“He would make comments periodically,” Barnetta said. “He would joke, ‘I’ll be sitting in a nursing home with dementia.’ ”

But Barnetta mainly worried about the pain medications Tyler was taking and felt they were the source of his problems. “We thought the surgery he was going to have would take care of things so he didn’t have to take the medication and we would have our son back,” she said.

Two days before he was found dead, a Sunday, Tyler was at his parents’ house and spent much of the day playing with his nieces and nephews. But he had recently fallen off a ladder and dislocated his shoulder again. His mother and sister popped it back in.

“It must have cracked and snapped 10 times, 20 times,” said Barnetta, adding that Tyler appeared exhausted, which she surmised was from a lack of sleep.

Tyler left his parents’ house Sunday around 9 p.m., making his way to his home in another part of Oskaloosa.

“What I suspect is that he found some methadone from somewhere and he took it to relieve his pain but there are probably special instructions that go with that,” Barnetta said.

The next day, Labor Day, Barnetta went to Tyler’s house, as she often did, to walk his dog.

“I saw him sleeping on the couch,” she said of Tyler. “I was so happy because he had seemed so tired and stressed out.”

She walked the dog, brought it back to the house and quietly closed the door. She returned the next morning, Sept. 8.

“That’s when I found him,” she said. “We think he died Sunday night. He was gone.”",8480
547803254516490240,false,"Will you be able to float on Jan. 4, 2015, aka Zero G Day? 

Hint: No.

The very first nonsense I had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on Jan. 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease, allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment: “Zero G Day.” This exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places, so I’ve decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it, hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year’s end. It seems fitting that (hopefully) this is also the last debunking I’ll make in 2014. But who knows? There’s still a week left.

Something you’ll never hear me say: “Well, now I’ve heard it all.”

Advertisement



Phil Plait Phil Plait writes Slate’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!

So what’s sillier than these? Well, we now have the claim that early next year—on Jan. 4, 2015 at 09:47 PST to be exact—due to the combined gravity of Jupiter and Pluto, you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds (or at least fall more slowly, depending on different “sources”).

It’s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is. First off, this exact same hoax was pulled last year, in 2014, by a site called News Hound (now offline, apparently), and a lot of people fell for it. Here we are again, a year later, back at the same spot. This time the joke is being made by a “news” site called Daily Buzz Live (which didn’t even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax). They even have a picture of a NASA tweet about the event:

Photo from Daily Buzz Live

There’s only one problem: That picture is completely fake. NASA never tweeted it, and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on Daily Buzz Live. Whoever did it was clever, adding the number of retweets and favorites, but it’s as fake as a $20 iPhone you can buy on the street in New York City.

After all, the physics of “Zero G Day” is wrong, the claim about Pluto and Jupiter is wrong, and—and this part is the real killer—it’s based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago!

Despite this, it’s spreading around Facebook (and Twitter) so much once again that I got a lot of people asking or telling me about it. That’s why I’m debunking this thing again.

So to get started, here’s the claim:

It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014, an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Advertisement



Yeah, except this is all baloney. To be polite. OK, so why is this wrong?

Pluto and Jupiter, Sitting in a Tree …

First of all, the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally.

And we’re done. Full stop.

Advertisement



OK, fine, I’ll give some brief details. The planets are big objects with lots of gravity, but that only affects you if you’re close to them. Space, however, is big—that’s why we call it space—and planets are far away. This weakens their gravity on you hugely, reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly’s wing.

If you want the math, then here you go: Even if you add all of the planets together, they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the Moon! The Daily Buzz Live article mentions tides, too, but that’s even worse: The combined tidal force from the planets is far less, like 0.005 percent of the Moon’s! Simply put, the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you. By the way, the Moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse, so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks.

Note that you cannot float in the air every two weeks.

And specifically, the gravity from Pluto is weakest of them all. Pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball, far smaller than even our Moon … and at its closest it’s flippin’ 4 billion kilometers (2.5 billion miles) from Earth. That’s a long way. A car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than Pluto does.

In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does. That's about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell ... so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.

Location3

It gets worse (amazingly). The article says Pluto will be “directly behind Jupiter” on Jan. 4, 2015. I checked: On that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky. They’re really far apart, about 145°. You couldn’t have picked a much worse date to claim Pluto was behind Jupiter.

So the physics of the claim is ridiculous. But the origin of the claims makes it even funnier.

Fool Me Once, Shame on You

The article on Daily Buzz Live mentions that this claim came from Patrick Moore. He was a real astronomer in the U.K., an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter—he predated Carl Sagan and is still considered an icon of science in England.

The wonderful thing about all this is: Moore actually did make this claim! However, as Snopes.com points out, it was an April Fools' Day joke. Moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program. To my complete unsurprise, apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect! This is called “priming,” where you tell people in advance that they’ll feel something due to some cause, and they will, even if the cause never happened. It’s used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit, to spook people before they actually enter a “haunted house,” guaranteeing they’ll feel chills as they walk from room to room. I’ve seen this myself first hand: People can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened.

Hope Floats

So there you go: It’s a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first place.

I know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for this. I understand this reaction, but I don’t share it. Smart people fall for silly things all the time, and intelligence isn’t really the prime factor here.

Skepticism is. In general, schools don’t teach people how to analyze a claim, how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it, or how to go about looking into the claim. I knew right away to do the math, and to see if Pluto and Jupiter really were aligned as the article says. But all too often, people don’t think carefully (or at all) about these claims, and simply spread them through social media. All it takes is literally the click of a “Share” button. Pseudoscience thrives via this virulence, whereas truth must take a harder path.

In fact, that’s why I bother debunking stuff like this. Sure, this is a silly claim, and probably harmless in practice. But not all of them are; I already mentioned the “Mayan Notpocalypse” from 2012, and I can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism. And of course there are real issues like global warming denial, anti-vaccination, and more, which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public.

In my original post about this in January 2014, I said, “This particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two, but those others are here to stay for a long time.” I was wrong, and I should’ve known that something like this would resurface again in a year; it’s like the “Mars as big as the Moon” nonsense that comes back year after year.

Still, my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of (polite) skepticism into people’s everyday lives, it makes the world a slightly better place to be.",8389

Just moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.

The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

Scroll down for videos

Job done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morning

In control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a hero

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms

And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

He's a very intelligent and responsible person... but you don't want to mess with him Kevin Vickers' cousin

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

Heroic: He took down Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, pictured - his first ever exchange of gunfire in his career

Innocent victim: Natan Cirillo, 24, was the soldier shot dead in Wednesday's terror attack on the Canadian Parliament complex

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday when he returned to the more usual duty of delivering the ceremonial mace to the chamber

Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks

He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'I AM MAD AT OUR SON': TERRORIST'S MOTHER SPEAKS OUT Immigration chief Susan Bibeau - mother of terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau 'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

What happens to witnesses! 

http://t.co/BFc2ucgVX3 http://t.co/A7vbDOSIJN",http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/11/29/the-deandre-joshua-murder/,True,The DeAndre Joshua Murder,"DeAndre Joshua, 20, was murdered on the same night of the Saint Louis Grand Jury announcement. DeAndre was shot in the head, and then a flammable liquid poured on him and set afire inside his vehicle.

DeAndre Joshua also fits the social profile of several eye-witnesses who gave the police/FBI statements and testified before the Grand Jury in the Mike Brown shooting case. If that were the only coincidence it might be easy to dismiss. Alas, it’s not. Out of an abundance of caution for other witnesses we are avoiding outlining the most direct connections.

As you are aware DeAndre was an employed black male, with no history of drug use or illicit behavior. In the Canfield Community marijuana is not considered illicit, nor does weed really qualify as drug use – it’s as common as tobacco. DeAndre was also a friend of Dorian Johnson who is currently under protection.

Obviously his friend, Dorian Johnson is very alarmed, understandably so. On the night before the Grand Jury announcement, there were considerable nerves amid a select group in the Ferguson community.

As the attention of a nation turned to the grand jury decision, and also to the demands of the Justice for Mike Brown coalition, Dorian Johnson was potentially going to be the recipient of a tremendous amount of angst. Several people were looking for DeAndre and Dorian.

Dorian was in hiding – DeAndre was vulnerable.

Another witness who falls into this almost identical profile is Witness #35, who has been identified under the name “Viron”. However, even the FBI agents who interviewed Viron are unsure of his actual identity.

Witness #35 presented himself for FBI interview with an “uncle”, and a female attorney. When it came to identify himself, well, the ambiguity is almost unbelievable were it not documented by the federal authorities. (See Page #32)

Witness #35 would not give his real name, nor his social security number, nor his address or contact information, and would only sign his statement with an alias.

In hindsight, and against the backdrop of the death of DeAndre Joshua, the reluctance of Witness #35 might lead a researcher to understand a prescient fear was not unfounded.

However, social media is identifying a profile that fits a connection to Dorian as described in the affidavit, Viron becomes Devorion Livingston. Devorion is a friend to both eye-witness and robbery cohort Dorian Johnson, along with the murdered DeAndre Joshua.

Given the relationships, the connections, and the documented associations, Devorion fits the profile of Witness #35 who gave the painful to read testimony to the FBI where they were consistently reminding him, and warning him, about the risks of lying about the events. Witness #35 read his testimony here.

Devorion Livingston is also pictured below with Dorian Johnson last year at Canfield apartment complex. Note the vehicle in the background:

DeAndre Joshua murder […] Authorities say a pile of broken glass and blood lay beside the white Pontiac Grand Prix Joshua was found inside. (link)

Yes, that’s a White Grand Prix behind Dorian Johnson (purple shirt) and Devorian Livingston.

Both Dorian Johnson and Devorion Livingston found out about DeAndre’s brutal murder at approximately the same time.

Dorian Johnson, who is in protective custody, was understandably freaking out.

Below you can see how Devorion Livingston payed homage to his now murdered friend the day he found out.

Apparently the three Canfield friends, Devorion, Dorian and DeAndre, knew each other for quite some time.

However, prior to the grand jury announcement Devorion Livingston and his pregnant wife (?) got the heck outta dodge Ferguson. (click to enlarge and read the FB narrative)

Obviously DeAndre Joshua didn’t leave Ferguson – he was murdered last Monday in Canfield Greens Apartment complex, mere yards away from where Mike Brown was shot.

So the ultimate question becomes is this just mere coincidence? Dorian, Devorian and DeAndre being close friends. Dorian in hiding, Devorian having left town, and DeAndre now murdered. A person would have to be exceptionally obtuse not to see the connections.

But if it’s not a coincidence, then why?

Street Justice Rules – Witness #14 gives a chilling account of what would happen to these kids if they told the wrong story – and what were the risks.

Initially Witness #14 talked to State investigators – however, in his August 12th statement he mentioned the false story surrounding the “hands up – don’t shoot” narrative; and the pressure from the community to tell lies in support of the construct (read here).

That initial statement prompted the FBI to come and visit Witness #14 specifically to talk about that aspect of his statement.

Within the FBI interview -a day before he was scheduled to appear before the grand jury- Witness #14 tells the FBI not only about the “hand’s up” story being totally made up by the community, but also that Mike Brown’s step-dad, Louis Head, was the enforcer to insure compliance (read here).

Apparently Louis Head was the threat to make sure that all of the witnesses in/around Canfield Greens Apartment complex said the right things, the “hands up – don’t shoot” things.

Louis Head was also the person who gained notoriety by climbing upon a vehicle and shouting “Burn This Bitch Down” the night DeAndre was murdered…

…. The night DeAndre Joshua was indeed “burned down” while seated in his Grand Prix.

Witness #14 was scheduled to testify on September 25th at 10:30am. He never showed up.

Perhaps these are all coincidences. Perhaps.

However, perhaps Louis Head, and those of like-minded association, also hold the greatest motive for anger toward Dorian Johnson, and as a consequence toward anyone who was unsuccessful at getting Justice for Mike Brown.

Several of the eye-witnesses, who gave honest testimony to the Grand Jury, were, according to their own statements, warned immediately after the shooting to keep their mouths shut. All of the eye-witnesses were African American. If you read the reports the sense of fear about speaking the truth is overwhelming.

Many, if not all, of the witness statements outlined in police reports, FBI reports, and later in Grand Jury testimony -who testified to the factual events as outlined by officer Wilson, and whose testimony fit the physical and forensic evidence- were threatened by the local Canfield Greens community.

Was the murder of DeAndre Joshua an outcome of a broken street code? His family thinks so:

(Via Daily Mail) A man has died during the Ferguson riots just yards from where Michael Brown was shot dead. Residents on Canfield Drive said that DeAndre Joshua, 20, was shot whilst in his car though police at the scene refused to confirm any details.

DeAndre’s grandmother Renita Towns said that ‘somebody killed him’ during the carnage.

She said that he graduated Beaumont High School and that he was working in Wal-Mart.

Family member Brian Joshua, 45, added: ‘He was a good kid, he’s gone to high school, he’s got a job, he’s not into drugs or any of that stuff.

‘I only saw him yesterday morning. He was a smart guy, he spoke cleanly, he was positive’.

Police took away DeAndre’s white Pontiac Grand Prix and interviewed witnesses around 11am. A woman in her 20s broke down in tears and said: ‘I knew him, he was my twin’. (read more)

This is a typical example of the sentiment, threats and fear :

In the interim, where’s the Justice for DeAndre Foundation?

The murder of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 in the UK was ""probably"" approved by President Vladimir Putin, an inquiry has found.

Mr Putin is likely to have signed off the poisoning of Mr Litvinenko with polonium-210 in part due to personal ""antagonism"" between the pair, it said.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the murder was a ""blatant and unacceptable"" breach of international law.

But the Russian Foreign Ministry said the public inquiry was ""politicised"".

It said: ""We regret that the purely criminal case was politicised and overshadowed the general atmosphere of bilateral relations.""

What Litvinenko report means for UK

Key findings of the public inquiry

Who was Alexander Litvinenko?

Who are the Litvinenko murder suspects?

Story of a perplexing murder

Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin's spokesman, said Moscow's official response to the report will happen through ""diplomatic channels"", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would have to go on having ""some sort of relationship with them [Russia]"" because of the Syria crisis, but it would be done with ""clear eyes and a very cold heart"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron said the murder of Alexander Litvinenko had been shown to be ""state-sponsored""

The long-awaited report into Mr Litvinenko's death found that two Russian men - Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - deliberately poisoned the 43-year-old in London in 2006 by putting the radioactive substance polonium-210 into his drink at a hotel.

Sir Robert Owen, the public inquiry chairman, said he was ""sure"" Mr Litvinenko's murder had been carried out by the two men and that they were probably acting under the direction of Moscow's FSB intelligence service, and approved by the organisation's chief, Nikolai Patrushev, as well as the Russian president.

He said Mr Litvinenko's work for British intelligence agencies, his criticism of the FSB and Mr Putin, and his association with other Russian dissidents were possible motives for his killing.

'Send a message'

There was also ""undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism"" between Mr Putin and Mr Litvinenko, he said.

The use of polonium-210 was ""at the very least a strong indicator of state involvement"" as it had to be made in a nuclear reactor, the report said.

The inquiry heard evidence that Mr Litvinenko may have been consigned to a slow death from radiation to ""send a message"".

What is polonium-210?

Image caption The teapot where traces of polonium-210 were discovered

Giving a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said Mr Cameron would raise the findings with President Putin at ""the next available opportunity"".

She said the UK would impose asset freezes on Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun and that international arrest warrants for the pair remained in place. They both deny killing Mr Litvinenko.

Both men are wanted in the UK for questioning, but Russia has refused to extradite them.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Marina Litvinenko: 'Russian spies must be expelled from UK'

Speaking earlier outside the High Court, Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said she was ""very happy"" that ""the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr Putin have been proved by an English court"".

She urged the UK government to expel all Russian intelligence operatives, impose economic sanctions on Moscow and impose a travel ban on Mr Putin.

The view from Moscow

Image copyright AP Image caption Andrei Lugovoi, left, and Dmitry Kovtun pictured in Moscow, in 2007

By the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev

For years Moscow rejected allegations of high-level involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko.

The fact President Putin himself is now associated with this assassination has not changed anything.

Taking their lead from Robert Owen's use of the words ""high probability"", the second tier of the Russian establishment, mainly Kremlin-loyalist MPs, are dismissing the entire report as a politically-based fabrication.

Russians on social media are making fun of its conclusions by using the hashtag ""PutinPossiblyApproved"" in Russian - that is #ПутинВозможноОдобрил - to include all manner of crimes.

One Russian MP, Nikolai Kovalev, himself an ex-FSB boss, pointed out relations between Moscow and London would not be harmed by the report as there was no room for making them any worse.

How Russian media reported the Litvinenko inquiry

Responding to the report, Mr Lugovoi, who is now a politician in Russia, said the accusations against him were ""absurd"", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying.

""As we expected, there were no surprises,"" he said.

""The results of the investigation made public today yet again confirm London's anti-Russian position, its blinkeredness and the unwillingness of the English to establish the true reason of Litvinenko's death.""

Mr Kovtun, now a businessman in Russia, said he would not comment on the report until he got more information about its contents, Interfax reported.

'Harm relations'

London's Metropolitan Police said the investigation into the ""cold and calculated murder"" remained ongoing.

Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador in the UK, said Russia would not accept any decisions reached in secret and based on evidence not tested in open court.

The length of time taken to come to these conclusions led them to believe it was ""a whitewash of British security services' incompetence"", he said.

Mr Yakovenko said these events ""can't help but harm our bilateral relations"".

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he did not have ""any actions"" to announce following the inquiry's findings. ""But I certainly wouldn't rule out future steps,"" he said.

Analysis

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Alexander Litvinenko at a news conference in Moscow in 1998, when he was an officer of Russia's state security service FSB

By BBC security correspondent, Gordon Corera

The conclusions of this inquiry are stronger than many expected in pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin personally.

The evidence behind that seems to have come from secret intelligence heard in closed session.

Saying that Alexander Litvinenko was killed because he was an enemy of the Russian state will raise pressure on the British government to take real action - the steps taken nearly a decade ago were only limited in scope.

That may pose difficulties given the importance of Russia's role in the Middle East, but without tough action people may ask if the Russian government has been allowed to get away with what has been described as an act of nuclear terrorism on the streets of London.

Mr Litvinenko fled to the UK in 2000, claiming persecution. He was granted asylum and gained British citizenship several years later.

In the years before his death, he worked as a writer and journalist, becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin ""probably"" approved the killing, the report says

It is believed he also worked as a consultant for MI6, specialising in Russian organised crime.

The inquiry heard from 62 witnesses in six months of hearings and was shown secret intelligence evidence about Mr Litvinenko and his links with British intelligence agencies.

http://t.co/cUzepktlxx http://t.co/eh0T2oHhFz",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/ottawa-shooting-nathan-cirillo-reservist-from-hamilton-killed-in-attack-1.2808960,True,Cpl. Nathan Cirillo dreamed of becoming full-time soldier,"The opening shots that began a devastating day on Parliament Hill killed a Hamilton reservist who dreamed of being a full-time soldier and deprived his kindergarten-aged son of his father.

Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot while on honorary guard at the National War Memorial. Ottawa Police announced hours after the shooting that the soldier shot at the memorial had died.

He would later be identified as Cirillo, a reservist from Hamilton serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada regiment. Cirillo died a short time after the attack despite frantic efforts to revive him at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Lt.-Col. Lawrence Hatfield of the Argylls made a brief statement on Wednesday night to reporters and members of the public who gathered outside the James Street armoury.

""The regiment wishes to express its sincere condolences to the family of Cpl. Cirillo as well as to express our thanks that's been demonstrated by the support of Canadians across this country,"" he said. ""Cpl. Cirillo was a very proud member of the Argylls and the Highlanders of Canada. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and we hope that Canadians share that with us.""

Jim Cirillo, uncle of the deceased, said his nephew persevered and achieved great things after a sometimes difficult upbringing. (CBC)

Back in East Hamilton, the news spread through his extended the family. A distraught uncle, Jim Cirillo, answered the door to his Barton Street East home with swollen eyes, a TV locked on the 24-hour news cycle of the unfolding events, and a computer opened to a picture of his nephew, Nathan. Between tears, he pointed at the picture on the screen. He said his sister-in-law and mother to Nathan, Kathy, couldn’t believe the news.

“She's saying she doesn't believe it … She went on the internet and she saw it and she … I don't know how she didn't pass out.

“She's just completely broken, broken right now.""

Jim Cirillo said Nathan and his two sisters weren't ""dealt a good hand,"" with a difficult divorce splitting up their parents.

""And now for him to get shot and pass away, I don't know if life is fair … he didn't deserve that,"" he said. ""I don't know how someone could have picked him out and do that.""

Joined cadets at 13

Along with Hamilton Police Chief Glenn De Caire, Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina visited the family and told reporters outside the armoury where Cirillo joined as a cadet when he was 13 years old that he expects the fallen soldier to have a funeral with “full service honours.”

""It was very sad but there was some comfort in being with Chief De Caire, who has experience with dealing with sudden loss of life,"" Bratina said. ""We had some hugs and tears. One young boy walked in and said to his aunt, I believe it was, 'I saw you crying.'""

Bratina said Cirillo had two sisters, and was part of ""a typical Hamilton family. Beautiful home. Clean as a whip. Pictures of Nathan and his two sisters on the wall. It was the kind of place that any of us would feel right at home going into.""

Jim Cirillo confirmed that Nathan's father has been in Costa Rica for several years. Nathan had tried to reconnect with his father a few years ago, and had recently reconnected with his mother. She will be taking care of his son, Marcus, who just entered kindergarten, and his two dogs. The child's mother, who had the baby while Cirillo was still a teenager, is no longer in the picture.

Cirillo was a personal trainer, former Good Life fitness employee and bouncer at a downtown Hamilton bar, Club Absinthe.

Manager Billy Pozeg said he would often come straight from the armoury in his fatigues, and change at the club before his shifts, joking he would go from one service job to another. He added Cirillo would bring up the mood in a room with a smile as wide as his shoulders, adding his dream was to be a full-time member of the military.

His pictures posted on Facebook and Instagram show a man always smiling, who played guitar and loved his two large dogs. He posed for tourists shortly before he was attacked.

'Communication lockdown'

A source who asked not to be identified told CBC News in Hamilton that members from the unit have all been ordered not to speak about the incident.

Nathan Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, said Cirillo owned two German Shepherds. (Instagram)

""They are now all on communication lockdown,"" the source said. ""They’ve been told to put their phones away and all bases are all locked down.""

Cirillo's friend, Marie Michele, has been trying to make sense of the news all day. She first realized Cirillo had been shot when pictures of paramedics trying to save his life was shown on television Wednesday morning.

""I saw his face and it was him,"" Michele said. ""That's how I found out it was Nathan.

""Nathan was a good man. He would give anything to anyone,"" she said. ""He was there for everyone.""

Police have set up a roadblock around the Cirillo family's home in east Hamilton while they decide who will be their spokesperson.

Members of Canada’s Muslim community offered condolences to the family, condemning the attack.

“The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Canada categorically and unequivocally condemns this morning’s terror attacks on the Canadian Parliament and the National War Memorial as well as on the Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec,” the organization said in a statement released Wednesday. “These acts of terror have no basis in any religion.”

The Argylls are an infantry unit of the Canadian Forces primary reserves within 31 Canadian Brigade Group. It is one of the largest army reserve units in the country with over 250 soldiers.

'It broke my heart'

Retired Col. Geordie Elms said Hamilton’s Highland regiment served in the first two World Wars, as well as Afghanistan, contributing more manpower than any other militia in Ontario. He knew it was an Argyll when he saw the uniform.

“It was terrible anyway. Then it became clear where this had taken place. That’s a ceremonial duty that goes to commemorating our history,” Elms said. “It’s tragic that it’s one of our Argylls.”

On average, Elms said a reservist dedicates one night a week and one weekend a month to it. Every year, there’ll be a concentrated exercise where it might be a week or 10 days.

Elms said the greatest single force of reservist recruits is still students, because of the nature of the work and the potential to do training during the summer period.

“For this particular task to guard the War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, they would have put out a notice and he would have answered it,” Elms said. “It’s an honour and a privilege to do that duty, just as it would be if you were to be part of the ceremonial guard on Parliament Hill in the summertime. It’s a sought-after task. It’s not a task they have any trouble filling.”

The soldiers who were guarding the National War Memorial are part of a ceremonial guard, and full-time and part-time soldiers are rotated through duty on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They carry rifles that aren't loaded.

CBC News has obtained a copy of an email directed to student soldiers with the Armed Forces telling them not to wear their uniforms, even on base.

Another email sent to military personnel authorized the wearing of uniforms on base, as well as inside their cars while travelling between the base and their homes, but that they should avoid wearing their uniforms in all other cases. The email also instructed military personnel in uniform not to make any stops — not even at gas stations, daycares, schools and elsewhere — while travelling between their base and home.

At the armoury in Hamilton, non-uniformed people were passing in and out of the gates, with uniformed guards standing watch at each side. People have been bringing flowers and notices of condolences to the building.

Veteran Ed Hughes dropped off a cross to the armoury Wednesday. ""I was injured in service,"" he said. ""It broke my heart when I found out he was from Hamilton. It broke my heart he was a Sutherland.""",8292

Forbes, AP) http://t.co/7LU1iT1EKB",http://usat.ly/1oAadlh,True,Chief: Officer noticed Brown carrying suspected stolen cigars,"CLOSE Ferguson, Missouri police department released store surveillance video that shows a man shoving the store clerk and stealing cigars. Michael Brown was a suspect in that robbery.

FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown was identified as a suspect in a strong-arm robbery of a box of cigars moments before he was shot to death by Officer Darren Wilson, police said Friday.

In an afternoon press conference, Ferguson, Mo. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson did not initially make a connection between the robbery and Brown,whose death spurred violent protests and unrest in the St. Louis suburb over the past week.

Wilson stopped Brown and a friend because ""they were in the middle of the street, blocking traffic,"" Jackson said.

Hours later, however, Jackson told a slightly different story to CNN and NBC, saying that Wilson noticed Brown was carrying a box of cigars that had been reported stolen. Wilson, he said, initially stopped Brown for blocking traffic, but as he began driving past Brown, he noticed Brown was holding cigars.

At that point, Wilson ""made the connection"" that Brown might have been involved in a theft that had just been broadcast on police radio, Jackson said.

Jackson earlier released Wilson's name along with information that Brown was a suspect in the previous robbery. He said he released surveillance video tape and documents related to the robbery to satisfy freedom of information requests from the public.

His decision to release both bits of information at the same time has come under fire by residents and Brown supporters who said the police were trying to divert attention away from Wilson and justify the shooting by blaming Brown.

Jackson would not say why he released the information when he did the way he did, other than to say he was responding to freedom of information requests from the public about the robbery.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, told USA TODAY the release of the officer's name alongside a robbery report naming Brown as a suspect ""smoke and mirrors.""

""There was nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that would justify this execution style murder by this police officer in broad daylight,"" Crump said. ""It's not enough that they assassinated him in broad daylight in the middle of the street. They also have to assassinate his character to try to get away with it.""

He said police were trying to divert the public's attention from the crux of the issue. He added that police only releasing photos of the robbery suspect and not Wilson shows that the department will not be transparent.

He said Brown's family believes the police strategically waited to release the officer's name to justify the fatal shooting.

Residents were angry.

""So then why did they shoot him?"" said Keith Miller, 58. ""The way they're putting this out, no one trusts the Ferguson cops. Things are going to stay calm for now. But people aren't going to be patient on this. If they don't charge this cop, it's going to start right back up.""

STORY: Late release of information risks further distrust

Jackson gave few details about Wilson, 28. He said Wilson has been a police officer for six years, four years in Ferguson and before that two years in nearby Jennings. Jackson said Wilson has had no disciplinary action against him.

""He's a a gentle quiet man,"" Jackson said in describing the officer. ""He's a distinguished officer.""

He said Wilson has been ""devastated"" by the shooting and its aftermath. ""He never intended for any of this to happen,"" Jackson said.

STORY: The other Darren Wilson

Earlier in the day, Jackson had given barebones details about a strong-arm robbery at a local convenience store that took place moments before Wilson shot Brown, but he did not explain at the time that the shooting was not connected to the robbery.

Police documents he released to reporters identified Brown as the suspect.

A police offense incident report dated Aug. 9 that was part of the packet of documents Jackson released quotes the officer writing, ""I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.""

The report does not name the officer or contain an officer's signature. It also does not contain the address where the robbery is said to have happened.

But it provides the following description of the robbery: An employee at a Ferguson convenience store saw Brown grab a box of Swisher Sweet cigars and hand them to another young man identified as Dorian Johnson, who was standing behind him. The employee said he told Brown he had to pay for the cigars and instead, Brown reached across the counter and grabbed numerous packets of cigars and turned to leave the store.

The report says according to the employee Brown grabbed his shirt and pushed him into a display rack. Then he and Johnson left the store without paying. Jackson said Johnson would not be charged with a crime.

The report describes Brown as 6'4, 292 pounds and wearing a white T-shirt, khaki long shorts, yellow socks and a red Cardinals baseball cap.

During a press conference in the afternoon, Jackson said he had to release the video tape because of several freedom of information requests.

Brown was unarmed when Wilson killed him. Witnesses in the area say Brown had raised his hands to surrender when he was shot. Police have not confirmed that information.

No one answered at Wilson's door in his home in suburban Crestwood, Mo. A police officer keeping an eye on the house said Wilson and his family left days ago.

A neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said that Wilson had moved into the neighborhood less than a year ago. She described him as "" tall and slim"" and that she would see him walking his dog in the neighborhood of mostly single-story brick homes. She said she didn't know he was the cop until this morning when Crestwood police informed residents that he was involved and the neighborhood would be getting attention.

Another neighbor, Ron Gorski, said he hopes Wilson gets a fair break.

""He's a young guy,"" Gorski said of Wilson. ""Things happen and it's a complicated situation. I feel for the family and the entire country.""

Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald Johnson and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon were not notified or consulted before Darren Wilson's name was released along with information that Brown was a suspect in a robbery.

""I would have liked to have been consulted,"" Johnson said at a press conference Friday.

He added that he hoped to talk to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson about the manner in which the information was released.

Nixon, meanwhile, said that police are still focused on learning details about Brown's death and that nothing should deter them from that goal.

""I think the focal point here remains to figure out how and why Michael Brown was killed and to get justice,"" he said.

The announcement comes after Twitter suspended an account Thursday linked to a loose-knit ""hacktivist"" group that released the name of a police officer it said shot and killed Brown on Saturday night. However, police, Ferguson's mayor and the stepmother of the man named all said the group was incorrect and that the person named is not a police officer.

As of early Friday morning, no violent clashes were reported after hundreds of protesters gathered and marched near the flashpoint where riots and civil unrest have unfolded here in recent days.

692105324111761408,non-rumor,"Actor Abe Vigoda, known for roles in 'The Godfather' and 'Barney Miller,' has died. https://t.co/RBfmAPRqDw. https://t.co/dOi64vr7Qb",http://cnn.it/1nNIZcC,True,"Abe Vigoda, of 'Godfather,' 'Barney Miller' fame, dies","(CNN) Abe Vigoda, who played the decrepit Detective Phil Fish in the television sitcom ""Barney Miller"" and Mafia lieutenant Sal Tessio in the original ""Godfather"" movie, died Tuesday, according to his manager, Sid Craig.

He was 94.

Vigoda died at the New Jersey home of his daughter, Carol.

Though Vigoda achieved a good bit of fame from his 1970s ""Godfather"" role, his years on ""Barney Miller"" and the short-lived spinoff ""Fish,"" he arguably became best known for being alive despite reports of his premature demise.

""I hope he knew about our tribute, and I hope he was amused by it. Our intent was always to bring a smile by pointing to his longevity, which was an inspiration,"" said Sun Sentinel reporter Rafael Olmeda, who ran Vigoda-themed social media pages.

A noted New York stage actor by the time Francis Ford Coppola came calling about ""The Godfather,"" Vigoda had not read the book and wasn't thinking about mobster roles; he was Jewish, not Italian.

But Coppola liked him as a mobster, and he won the role of Tessio in the 1972 original and returned for the 1974 sequel.

""The Godfather"" was his first really big job, and he remembered a car being sent for him every day of shooting and sitting near Marlon Brando during makeup.

""I found him to be a quiet man. He kept mostly to himself,"" Vigoda told CNN in 2008 . ""He was a great star. This was my first big thing: I felt lucky and grateful I was with these people.""

Notable to him was the presence of actual New York mob family members on the set. ""They kept looking at me, as if to say, 'What family is he from?' "" Vigoda said. ""It was fascinating.""

Robert Duvall, a ""Godfather"" co-star, remembered Vigoda in a statement.

""We had some great memories together and he will really be missed,"" Duvall said

#RIP #AbeVigoda. Dead at the age of 94. Most famous for his role as #tessio in the #godfather. Abe is the one on the left. #AlPacino is on the right. A photo posted by VladTV (@vladtv) on Jan 26, 2016 at 1:56pm PST

The ""Godfather"" movies led to his successful run on ""Barney Miller,"" which ran from 1974-82 and starred Hal Linden as the title character. Vigoda was on the show until 1977.

""Abe was responsible for as much of the success of 'Barney Miller' as I was -- easily. More so than me,"" Linden told CNN. ""We all owe a great debt of gratitude to a fine character actor who created a very memorable character that will go on and on, with all the re-runs. Thank God people will get to see what Abe did.""

Vigoda was nominated for three Emmy awards for his performance as Fish. In contrast to the very fit Vigoda, a dedicated handball player and jogger, Detective Fish complained about his aches, his pains, his bladder problems and hemorrhoids, always seeming on the verge of death.

Fans assumed he had the same ailments, he said.

""I was sitting in a restaurant,"" he told the Washington Post in 1977 , ""when this young lady came up and asked for my autograph.

""Then she said, 'I hope your hemorrhoids aren't bothering you too much.' She was very serious. I said, 'You must be joking.' She said, 'No, I'm not. I just don't want you to worry about it because I have them, too.' ""

Only his character was plagued by hemorrhoids, Vigoda told her, but he said she didn't believe him.

A ordinary person, like us

Many people liked Fish because he had many of the same ordinary problems they did, Vigoda told the Los Angeles Times in 1982.

""Like Fish, we all meet with rejection, and things are seldom easy, no matter what we do,"" he said.

But it was the 1982 report of his premature death that caused him some consternation and was the basis of many jokes during his later years.

As the story goes, he didn't attend a 1982 ""Barney Miller"" wrap party because he was doing a play in Canada. He was 60 at the time and very much not dead. But a People magazine writer assumed he wasn't there because he was dead.

""Somehow it mentioned in the article that 'the late Abe Vigoda' was not (there),"" Vigoda told CNN in 2008.

And thus, a joke was born, a joke that Vigoda eventually told as well.

People magazine acknowledged their mistake and awarded itself the Mark Twain Exaggerated Death Award ""for announcing the demise of 'Barney Miller's' Abe Vigoda before his time,"" months after the article was published, but it was too late.

The actor would later say he lost out on some parts because casting agents thought he was dead. He even placed ads in Hollywood trade papers with him in a coffin to remind casting agents he was alive. But he joked about it on ""Late Night with David Letterman.""

In his later years, Vigoda was featured in skits on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" on NBC. (O'Brien's current show, ""Conan,"" airs on TBS, owned by Turner Broadcasting, which also owns CNN).

""Abe was a huge part of our show in New York,"" O'Brien said on his show Tuesday night before playing a video tribute of Vigoda's appearances on his NBC show . ""I couldn't believe how many times Abe would come on the show and do hilarious things for us,"" sometimes with only a few hours' notice.

Vigoda would also occasionally stop by ""The Today Show"" to celebrate the birthdays of co-host Matt Lauer and former co-host Meredith Vieira, and Vieira once referred to him as ""the very much alive Abe Vigoda.""

Abe Vigoda was one of the nicest guys in the business...talent with a capital ""T"" and so sweet. He always left me with a smile on my face. — Meredith Vieira (@meredithvieira) January 26, 2016

As the Internet became widespread, Vigoda -- and his well-being -- became a hit for a generation that knew him only through reruns.

People could quickly find out whether he was living through a website dedicated to answering that question

""The running gag started in the summer of 2009, when the memorial for Michael Jackson was held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles,"" Olmeda said. ""I speculated that Abe Vigoda, Ernest Borgnine and Zsa Zsa Gabor were in attendance -- the joke being that no one expected those three to outlive the forever child, Michael Jackson.

""Over the years, untimely celebrity deaths gave rise to my growing amazement that Abe Vigoda was outliving so many people,"" said Olmeda, who took to honoring those celebrities with Vigoda-themed quotes.

One of Olmeda's favorite posts: ""Let the joyous news be spread: Abe Vigoda is still not dead!"" In honor of Ruth Robinson Duccini, the last female Munchkin.

Playing ""old"" in the first grade

Born February 24, 1921, Vigoda grew up on New York's Lower East Side, the son of a tailor who studied acting at the American Theatre Wing and played character parts for much of his early career.

He had established a successful New York stage career in the 1960s when ""Godfather"" director Coppola noticed his work.

""The Godfather"" changed Vigoda's life, leading him to ""Barney Miller,"" ""Fish"" and movies such as ""Cannonball Run II"" (1984) with Burt Reynolds, ""Look Who's Talking"" (1989) with John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, and ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" (1990) with Tom Hanks. He also appeared in 1997's ""Good Burger.""

I'm sad that Abe Vigoda passed away today at age 94. Wonderful actor. I loved working with him on Good Burger. pic.twitter.com/FGQCu19Bez — Dan Schneider (@DanWarp) January 26, 2016

But even as a youngster, he always played older than his actual age.

""When I was in first grade in New York, a teacher came into the room and told us she was casting a play titled 'Candlelight,' "" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1996. ""She said she needed someone to play a 50-year-old baron who finds his wife in the closet with a strange man.

""She asked if any of us would like to audition, and about 30 of us raised our hands,"" he continued. ""But she looked at me and said, ""I think you'll do, because you look old.' ""

Vigoda was married to his wife, Beatrice, for 24 years until her death in 1992. They had one daughter, Carol.",8043
500286058664579072,unverified,Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/rl0RgIphUp http://t.co/PHUofG7mJR,http://on.mash.to/1rADYzH,True,Police Name Officer in Michael Brown Shooting,"Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson named Darren Wilson as the officer who shot and killed unarmed Michael Brown, 18, in the St. Louis suburb on Aug 9.

But the police also suggested on Friday that Brown was a suspect in an unrelated convenience store robbery that took place shortly before he was shot. Jackson released a report that named Brown as ""the primary suspect"" in the incident, identified after he was fatally shot.

The police chief, who made the announcements in front of the QuikTrip convenience store that was torched in the first night of protests, said Officer Wilson has no history of disciplinary action. The chief didn't say if Wilson would face any punishment over Brown's shooting. The officer is a six-year veteran of the police force and was described by the chief in a second press conference on Friday as a ""gentle, quiet man.""

Brown was shot after the officer encountered him and another man on the street at 12:01 p.m. local time, Chief Jackson said on Friday. The initial confrontation occurred because Brown and a friend were ""walking down the street blocking traffic.""

What happened next is still unclear.

Police say one of the men pushed the officer into his squad car, then physically assaulted him in the vehicle and struggled with the officer over his weapon. At least one shot was fired inside the car. The struggle then spilled onto the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Witnesses have said the officer fired on Brown as he tried to run away.

One witness, who tweeted the immediate aftermath of the shooting, said he was shot at least seven times — two of them in the back.

witness to Brown killing

Reporters on Friday afternoon were unclear why the police chief released a report and video from the convenience store robbery, which the police chief clarified was unrelated and yet in which they finger Brown as a suspect. Chief Jackson said, ""Because you asked for it"" when he was questioned of this logic. Governor Jay Nixon, earlier, responded ""I don't know"" when asked why Jackson made the decision to release the alleged robbery video.

And the report, part of a packet given to reporters at the scene of Friday morning's announcement, included stills from the footage.

The images show a large black man — who police labeled as ""Brown"" — physically intimidating a smaller man at the convenience store.

The incident report says Brown stole a box of Swisher Sweet cigars, and physically intimated a store clerk when he tried to stop him, citing video form the store's surveillance system as evidence.

The unnamed officer who completed the report notes that Brown was fatally wounded following the alleged robbery.

""I responded to that scene and observed Brown,"" the officer writes. ""After viewing Brown and reviewing this video, I was able to confirm that Brown is the primary suspect in this incident.""

Michael Brown Incident Report

Some, however, questioned the discrepancies in Brown's clothing, noting he was wearing sandals in the video and yet wore sneakers when he was shot.

Benjamin Crump, Anthony Gray and Daryl Parks, attorneys for the Brown family, released a statement slamming the police chief's decision to name their son as an alleged suspect in the robbery:

Michael Brown's family is beyond outrages at the devious way the police chief has chosen to disseminate piece mil [sic] information in a manner intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight. There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender. The prolonged release of the officer's name and then the subsequent alleged information regarding a robbery is the reason why the family and the local community have such distrust for the local law enforcement agencies. It is no way transparent to release the still photographs alleged to be Michael Brown and refuse to release the photographs of the officer that executed him. The police strategy of attempting to blame the victim will not divert our attention, form being focused on the autopsy, ballistics report and the trajectory of the bullets that caused Michael's death and will demonstrate to the world this brutal execution of an unarmed teenager.

The night before Friday's events, county police in riot gear and armored tanks gave way to state troopers walking side-by-side with thousands of peaceful protesters after nearly a week of unrest and mounting public tension in the St. Louis suburb where an unarmed black teen was shot by a city police officer.

The dramatic shift Thursday came after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon assigned oversight of the protests to the state Highway Patrol, stripping local police from the St. Louis County Police Department of their authority after four days of clashes with furious crowds protesting the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Capt. Ronald Johnson, the Missouri State Highway Patrol captain put in charge of security in Ferguson, immediately criticized the decision to release information about the robbery, saying it was separate from the shooting.

""All they did was look at us and shoot tear gas,"" said Pedro Smith, 41, who has participated in the nightly protests. ""This is totally different. Now we're being treated with respect.""

The more tolerant response came as President Barack Obama spoke publicly for the first time about Saturday's fatal shooting — and the subsequent violence that shocked the nation and threatened to tear apart Ferguson, a town of 21,000 that is nearly 70 percent black and patrolled by a nearly all-white police force.

Obama said there was ""no excuse"" for violence either against the police or by officers against peaceful protesters.

Nixon's promise to ease the deep racial tensions was swiftly put to the test as demonstrators gathered again Thursday evening in the neighborhood where looters had smashed and burned businesses on Sunday and where police had repeatedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs.

But the latest protests had a light, almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd, more akin to a parade or block party.

The streets were filled with music, free food and even laughter. When darkness fell — the point at which previous protests have grown tense — no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters.

""You can feel it. You can see it,"" protester Cleo Willis said of the change. ""Now it's up to us to ride that feeling.""

Reporters at the scene Friday morning reported protesters seemed angry at the announcement that named the cop, but remained peaceful, with some handing out coffee to media who had come there.

Australia is contributing to the US-led operation against the Islamic State.

At least five people apparently escaped from the building during a tense standoff between heavily armed police and an unknown number of assailants holding hostages at gunpoint inside the Lindt Chocolate Café in Martin Place.

A senior Lindt Australia official said that 10 staff and up to 30 customers could be held hostage. There were “probably 30 customers” at the time of the attack, Sky Business quoted Lindt Chief Executive Steve Loane as saying.

The area surrounding the cafe has been sealed off by police, and Australian authorities have cleared the airspace over central Sydney to make way for police helicopters.

Live TV footage showed people standing inside the café with their hands pressed against the windows. At least one attacker was caught on camera wearing a traditional Islamic cap.

The hostages were forced to hold a black flag with an Arabic inscription, prompting fears that ruthless Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants were behind the attack.

Reports on the ground suggest that young women being held hostage in the cafe are being used as a shield, while an attacker is seen pacing around the room.

Police said they have made contact with the ""gunman,"" indicating that the assailant likely has no accomplices. The officials refrained from discussing the number of attackers or hostages being held, or possible motives behind the attack.

New South Wales (NSW) Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the prime goal in the crisis is to keep all hostages safe. He said the police had no information about any injuries. One of the escaped hostages was taken to hospital after being freed, but it was due to a pre-existing condition, the commissioner added.

Earlier, Australian 2GB radio host Ray Hadley said that the captor had demanded to speak with Prime Minister Tony Abbott live on the radio. Hadley added that hostages inside the cafe contacted him, but he declined to air their conversation due to safety concerns of those inside the building.

Another report claimed that gunmen have explosive suicide belts.

Dozens of police, including a SWAT team, were dispatched to the scene, and a couple hundred people were held back by cordons amid the evacuation of nearby buildings.

A cafe employee whose shift was about to start told RT that when he got to work, the doors were already locked and he saw a lot of hostages inside.

“I walked up to the door and then everyone was sitting down and the doors were locked. There was one guy walking around with a hat and a beard. I saw my manager there...There were a lot of people in there. Everyone inside put their arms against the windows.”

He added that before police arrived to the scene, people thought an armed robbery was taking place.

The flag – which appeared different from the one typically used by the IS – was identified as the shahada, or the statement of Islamic faith. The shahada itself only contains the religious inscription “There is no god but the God, Mohammed is the messenger of the God.” It is not directly connected to extremism, although it has been used by jihadist groups over the years.

The attack, which took place in Sydney’s central business district, forced nearby buildings in Martin Place – including the Reserve Bank of Australia – into lockdown.

The US has evacuated its Sydney consulate, which is close to the Lindt Cafe, Reuters quoted a spokeswoman as saying.

The consulate released an emergency statement to US citizens, warning them to ""maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security.”

Soon after news of the hostage situation emerged, the iconic Sydney Opera House was also evacuated. The move was reportedly prompted by a suspicious package found inside the building.

Local authorities put up barricades in front of the Opera House and a police helicopter was dispatched. Riot police arrived at the steps of the building.

Around 200 people were instructed to go to the western side of the building, The Australian reported. Witnesses heard security guards saying that a “training event” was taking place.

Later police, when asked about a possible bomb threat posed by the assailant or assailants, said they were not concerned about any location other than the Lindt Café itself. Bomb experts have checked potential targets for bomb attacks and cleared them as safe, the police said.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called the situation “deeply concerning,” adding that everything is being done to respond to the incident.

“This is obviously a deeply concerning incident but all Australians should be reassured that our law enforcement and security agencies are well trained and equipped and are responding in a thorough and professional manner,” he said in a statement.

“We don’t yet know the motivation of the perpetrator,” Abbott added at an emergency press conference. He did not rule out the possibility that the attack could be “politically-motivated.”

The PM said the National Security Committee of Cabinet was briefed on the situation and he has spoken to NSW Premier Mike Baird, offering him all possible Commonwealth support and assistance.

Shortly before the hostage incident, Daily Mail Australia reported that police had announced an arrest warrant for a 25-year-old man from northwestern Sydney, in connection with a major counter-terrorism investigation. An NSW police spokeswoman said that at this point, the two incidents do not appear to be connected, according to local media.

Media speculations connecting the attack to the Islamic State have sprung up, as Australia has been supporting the US-led anti-IS coalition in Syria and Iraq. Back in September, Canberra contributed 600 troops and up to 10 military aircraft to the campaign.

In October, Australia launched its first fighter jet mission in Iraq against the IS. “The Super Hornet aircraft conducted an air interdiction and close air support mission over northern Iraq overnight,” the Australian Defence Force said in a statement.

Canberra had earlier raised its security level to high, following threats of attacks by radicalized militants. Abbott warned that terrorists may use Australia's commitment to the anti-IS cause as an excuse to target the nation and its citizens.

“The reason why we are targeted is not because of anything that we’ve done, but because of who we are and how we live,” the prime minister said.",7921
693216311502073856,non-rumor,"Why digital companies need more liberal arts majors: Creativity, empathy, and listening are more important than ever https://t.co/yUGBfUqRXS",http://s.hbr.org/1m1wIzC,True,Digital Companies Need More Liberal Arts Majors,"In today’s digitally driven world, companies are competing ferociously for technological skills. They believe the ability to create the hard code that makes a product come to life is at the heart of their success. Without code, after all, you merely have ideas on a napkin or a dream in your head.

It’s the same with data analysts and business intelligence engineers. What’s more important than taking the massive amounts of data that a company receives every day and making sense of it? Decoding this data, everyone tells us, will help companies pinpoint exactly what each consumer wants and will inform a product’s creation in turn.

The current emphasis on these skills seems totally rational, as nothing happens without them and no company can ever hope to be successful in their absence. But what companies forget is that this won’t be true forever. In fact, it won’t be long before these very skills become commoditized. In the future, computers will take over more and more of these tasks, including programming and data crunching. The things that are foundational to a company’s success today will be replaced and automated by a machine tomorrow.

But there will be a limit to how far computers can replace human capabilities, at least in the near long term. What can’t be replaced in any organization imaginable in the future is precisely what seems overlooked today: liberal arts skills, such as creativity, empathy, listening, and vision. These skills, not digital or technological ones, will hold the keys to a company’s future success. And yet companies aren’t hiring for them. This is a problem for today’s digital companies, and it’s only going to get worse.

Insight Center Corporate Culture for a Digital World Sponsored by Accenture How technology is changing the way we work.

For example, launching a product with a mediocre user interface or unintuitive user experience is currently OK, if not encouraged as best practice. It’s part of the old Silicon Valley mantra: launch a product that barely works and iterate, iterate, iterate. But as more companies move to the digital space, they’re discovering that “launch and beg for patience” doesn’t hold true anymore. Ask Twitter how hard it is to gain new users, or ask anyone over 40 how to use Snapchat. You’ll see that neither service is designed for the mass consumer.

But as consumers begin to lead a digital life, companies must meet them where they are, regardless of their tech savvy. Companies with easy-to-use interfaces and intuitive functionality will win every time over companies that create any roadblock to using a product.

That’s where liberal arts skills come in — and where liberal arts students will finally have their day in the sun. Soon, companies will rush to hire these skills in the same way that they compete for coders and engineers today. And, perhaps not unsurprisingly, certain skills will be even more in demand in the leaders of the future:

Creativity: One of the core skills is the creative thinking that will help a company attract and engage users. Every company will need to figure out how to get consumers to use its product. What does the consumer want? How does the consumer feel? How can we make this product intuitive for the consumer? Creative thinkers will help companies create an easy-to-use, non-intimidating product that everyone can access. Simplicity is hard. If it were easy, anyone could and would do it. But only people with specialized creative skills — honed from years of thinking, reading, writing, and creating — have the talent of making the complex simple and the difficult accessible.

Leaders will need to both hire for more creative talent and create the type of culture in which creatives thrive. Employees will value cultures that are supportive, understanding, fluid, open, and dynamic. It stands to reason that these are the very same traits that a leader will need to demonstrate in order to create and support such a culture. Culture creation, then, will be a prized competency of future business leaders.

Empathy: It’s the core of a creative’s passion. For companies to truly understand the needs of the customer, they must be able to think and feel like a customer would. And for a business to be successful, knowing how its customers think and feel is everything. You can’t outsource that to a computer. You need to hire for it.

Empathy is just as important, if not more so, for the business leader running a company. Once a company has outsourced any manual work or task work to computers, drones, or a 3D printer, knowledge workers and creatives will make up the bulk of any future digital company. And these same employees will have higher support requirements from their leaders than they do today.

Business leaders with heightened senses of empathy will be rewarded in this environment. Not only will they be able to understand their customer better, they will also be required to lead their workforces through a breakneck pace of innovation. And how better to do so than by truly understanding their people and what drives each of them (emphasis on “each”)? One-size-fits-all will be a thing of the past. Employees will expect a leader to understand and meet their particular needs and wants.

Listening: If empathy is at the core of creativity, then listening is at the heart of empathy. And that is exactly what liberal arts majors have been prepared to do. It’s through listening that you make sense of the world. Knowledge workers who are able to truly hear and understand what is being said — and, equally important, what is not being said — will have a powerful impact on their organizations. By listening deeply, employees build substantive relationships with each other, as well as with customers. In doing so, they can perpetuate a more powerful culture and even increase sales.

Equally, leaders will have to stop talking so much and instead listen more — much more. Their smart employees have a lot to say and expect the forum in which to say it, and they want to make sure that they are fully understood. Speaking down to or patronizing these workers won’t be acceptable. They will expect to be treated more as equals, with greater disclosure of information and fewer hidden agendas. Similarly, using stilted company jargon or being opaque in communications is a sure-fire way to lose the respect of your most valuable employees. A leader has to have the capability not only to listen hard, but to demonstrate by their actions that they can turn what they’ve heard into action.

Vision: Finally, companies in the future will need all their employees, not just their leaders, to be visionaries. Employees will need to be able to take in massive amounts of information in a world that’s changing ever faster and then make sense of it all in a way that a computer can’t. A computer can factor in objective data, but a worker must take that data and then overlay it with subjective understanding that can’t always be quantified. The ability to understand the world through different lenses and turn competing or disparate viewpoints into a compelling narrative is an art, not a science. It requires an intuitive understanding of the world that comes from a deep immersion in the liberal arts.

Companies today should begin preparing themselves to be the powerhouses of tomorrow by bringing in more employees with liberal arts skills. Rather than scorning philosophy or history majors who have spent years wrestling knotty theoretical issues and then explicating them in precise details, companies should understand that the skills these students possess will help them become the leaders and CEOs of tomorrow.

692023417575448576,non-rumor,"Doctors should screen all adults for depression at least once, task force recommends. https://t.co/XsDQ3OlWb6",http://cnn.it/20qOlsi,True,"Screen pregnant women, new moms for depression, task force recommends","(CNN) Have you felt down a lot in the last couple of weeks? How often have you felt tired or felt as if you couldn't concentrate?

These are some of the questions your doctor might ask to determine if you are at risk of depression. And if new recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are followed, primary care physicians will do this type of depression screening for all adult patients at least once.

The recommendations by the task force, an independent expert panel, update its 2009 advice in two important ways: First, everyone 18 and older should be screened, the panel said -- and not just at clinics where systems are in place to connect at-risk individuals to mental health care. Second, primary care doctors should screen women who are pregnant or have recently given birth, two groups not included in earlier recommendations.

In the case of these new recommendations, primary care doctors include not just family doctors but also gynecologists, who provide many women with primary care, and obstetricians when women are pregnant and in the months following their delivery, said Dr. Michael P. Pignone, professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and one of the authors of the recommendations, which were published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association

""These recommendations are taking something that is good and making it even better,"" said Dr. Michael E. Thase, professor of psychiatry at University of Pennsylvania and the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia. Thase was not involved in creating the recommendations but wrote an editorial about them in the same issue of the journal

""They no longer say 'when support is available' because they just assume that it's available. ... The care for depression in primary care settings is improving,"" Thase said.

As for the second update, ""there's been a big chunk of work in the area of depression in pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and there's good evidence not just for (antidepressants) but for various kinds of counseling and psychotherapy,"" he said.

An estimated 7% of adults in the United States suffer depression every year. As the authors of the task force recommendations wrote, depression is the top cause of disability among adults in high-income countries, increases the risk of death and decreases the quality of life for patients and their family members.

How does screening work?

Many primary care doctors are probably already screening people for depression. ""I don't know if it's universal yet, but it's moving in that direction,"" Thase said, adding that the current recommendations will probably move screenings along further. In fact, some electronic medical systems require doctors to say they have screened a patient before they can complete the appointment, he added.

A common scenario for screening is that a patient completes a test on paper or electronically while waiting to see the doctor. If the test reveals a patient is at risk of depression, a doctor or nurse does a more thorough evaluation and talks with the patient about whether to start antidepressants or therapy.

Research has found that a nine-question test called the Patient Health Questionnaire does a good job of identifying people who are risk of having depression. In addition to asking about mood, fatigue and concentration, it asks people about their appetite, whether they have been interested in activities and whether they have thought about hurting themselves in the last two weeks.

The task force also recommends a seven-question test as an alternative for screening the general population. Older adults and women during the perinatal period should be screened with variations of these tests.

There is good evidence for the effectiveness of these tests, but they do have flaws.

""You can see exactly what the tests are about, so it's possible if you don't wish to be known to be depressed you can answer no to all the questions and your score is zero (but) hopefully it doesn't happen that often,"" Thase said.

Another issue is that the tests often identify people who have other disorders such as alcoholism or obsessive compulsive disorder. In the case of the nine-question test, about half of the people who are initially picked up actually have something other than depression.

""There the screening is still valuable because it does show a distress signal ... and by clarifying how they're suffering they can get help,"" Thase said.

As for how often people should be screened, the task force was careful not to make any recommendations. ""This is one of those issues that we called out as needing more research,"" Pignone said.

Although every adult patient should be screened at least once, groups at higher risk of depression, such as those with a history of depression or a chronic condition such as diabetes, should possibly be screened more often, Thase wrote in his editorial.

Another important point is that ""people identified as having depression will need follow-up to make sure they're effectively treated and their depression resolves,"" Pignone said.

Does screening really help?

Part of the reason for the move to recommend screening in the general population is because, as the task force states, ""(depression care) support is now much more widely available and accepted as part of mental health care.""

""We believe that all practices should have adequate systems in place to screen, treat and follow up on depression,"" Pignone said. Although there is no monitoring to know if they really do, ""I think compared to 15 years ago, more primary care practices are equipped to do this work,"" he added.

The most important thing is for primary care doctors to be trained in how to identify people with depression and then either treat them, such as with antidepressants, or refer them to a mental health care provider, Pignone said.

There is good evidence that screening does lead to robust improvements in depressive symptoms when the right care systems are in place, and that there are even improvements when the care systems are lacking, he said.

The ideal situation would be for these mental health care providers, such as therapists, to be part of the primary care practice ""so they can work side by side with the physical health care provider to address the mental health needs of the patient,"" said Ellen L. Poleshuck, associate professor of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

""The recommendations provide support as to why we need to have additional resources in place"" in areas that do not have adequate resources, said Poleshuck, who is also director of the Collaborative Care Services and Women's Behavioral Health Service at the medical center.

However, she does not think these areas should hold off on screening in the meantime. ""People are going to be depressed whether we screen them or not,"" Poleshuck said.

Screening pregnant women and new moms

Poleshuck added, ""One of the things that I think is exciting about these new recommendations is the decision to specify that it includes pregnant and postpartum women because we know that untreated depression in (these) women can affect the baby as well as the mother.""

The task force provides advice about treatment of these women. Because there are still questions surrounding the safety of antidepressants for fetuses and breast-feeding babies, they recommend that clinicians first try treating women with therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.

""For the most part I agree with that,"" Poleshuck said. ""I think for women with severe depression or a history of responding well to antidepressants in the past, we may want to consider treating with antidepressants earlier. I think it has to be a patient specific decision.""",7857
519275971758026752,true,Hewlett-Packard will split into two companies to adapt to a changing technology landscape http://t.co/li9tvB52cY,http://nyti.ms/1EmgLcZ,True,Hewlett-Packard Announces Breakup Plan as Technology Landscape Shifts,"Ms. Whitman will retain much power at both companies. She will be chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and will serve as nonexecutive chairman of HP Inc. Patricia F. Russo, currently a director of HP, will be chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. Dion Weisler, now head of HP’s printing business, will be president and chief executive of HP Inc.

The company also added to the number of prospective job cuts. In an earlier conference call with analysts, it said it had “identified opportunities for incremental improvements” in its plan to eliminate a total of 50,000 jobs through layoffs and retirements. It now expects the number to be 55,000.

From Split to Acquisitions to Another Split Until recently, HP was the world’s largest technology company by revenue. However, it has struggled to be on the vanguard, as trends like mobile and cloud computing have dominated the tech landscape. Monday’s split is an attempt to catch up. Jan. 1, 1999 00:00 AM In March, HP announces that it will split its measurement division and its PC business, a move to focus on computing that follows a year of lackluster performance.



In July, the company names Carly Fiorina its new chief executive. The appointment makes Ms. Fiorina, who previously worked at Lucent, a telecommunications company, one of the most powerful women in business. Jan. 1, 2002 00:00 AM HP acquires Compaq for $25 billion. The two companies have been hurt by PC price wars, where it has been difficult for makers to differentiate themselves when all except Apple are offering Microsoft operating systems.



The merger is a way to create a stronger competitor in both the server computing and PC businesses, though it's opposed by a Hewlett family heir, who claims that it would increase HP's dependence on the low-profit PC business while diminishing the role of the company's crown jewel, its printer division.



Under one banner, the new HP quickly becomes the world leader in PC sales. Jan. 1, 2005 00:00 AM Ms. Fiorina oversaw the Compaq acquisition, but she is forced out as revenue slips. Her departure comes as pressure continues from shareholders to break up the company by spinning off its highly profitable computer printer business.



In March, Mark Hurd is named the new chief executive. He led a turnaround at NCR, a maker of computers and A.T.M.s, and his appointment underscores HP’s commitment to expand into consumer electronics. (He will step down in five years, after disagreements with the board following investigations of his conduct with a contract employee.) Jan. 1, 2009 00:00 AM The company acquires 3Com, a provider of computer network equipment, for $2.7 billion.



Under Mr. Hurd, HP beefs up its network equipment offerings to compete more aggressively against Cisco to sell data center equipment to corporations. Jan. 1, 2010 00:00 AM HP picks up Palm, a pioneer in hand-held devices that found itself struggling after BlackBerrys and then iPhones grew popular.



HP signals plans to move into the increasingly lucrative cellphone and tablet markets, but the company is unable to take advantage of the operating system developed by Palm, called WebOS. Jan. 1, 2011 00:00 AM The company says that it is considering ""strategic alternatives"" for its PC business; that it is killing its TouchPad tablet; and that it is acquiring Autonomy, a global infrastructure software company for the enterprise, for $11.1 billion. (HP will later attribute a multibillion-dollar write-down it would take to accounting errors at Autonomy.)



Meg Whitman, eBay's former chief executive, comes in to lead the company. After taking over eBay as the dot-com bubble was hitting its peak, she was credited with transforming the e-commerce site into a global powerhouse. Jan. 1, 2013 00:00 AM HP releases ultra-low-power Moonshot servers, which can run on the kind of chips that normally go into cellphones.



The new servers, which are projected to spur great amounts of innovation, seek to address a growing market as more computing takes place online and in the cloud.



(Within a year of their release, as the servers fail to revolutionize the fortunes of HP, the company will pare its ambitions for Moonshot and make the servers smaller-scale products.) Jan. 1, 2014 00:00 AM Much as it did 15 years earlier, HP says it is splitting itself in two to focus on a more promising aspect of its business.



This time the focus is on enterprising computing and the cloud, and not PCs, the demand for which has been plummeting in recent years.

The company said its financial analysts’ meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, had been postponed.

“HP’s board and management have made a brilliant value-enhancing move at the perfect time in the turnaround,” Ralph V. Whitworth, founder of Relational Investors and a former Hewlett chairman, said in a statement on Monday. “The new companies will be better positioned to address today’s light-speed market dynamics and customer needs, and with distinct and compelling financial profiles and strong leadership teams, accelerate growth and shareholder value creation.”

The company’s shares closed up 4.7 percent Monday at $36.87, a gain of $1.67.

In a little over a year, stalwarts like Microsoft, IBM and Dell have changed chief executives, sold big parts of their businesses or gone private. All of them, along with a host of other companies that became behemoths during a 20-year boom in personal computing and the Internet, are rushing to cope with the rise in mobile devices connected to cloud systems.

Cloud computing uses software to turn numerous computer servers, sometimes a million or more, into single entities. These flexible systems can distribute work with greater efficiency, cutting the overall need for servers, and interact easily with other computers, whether in clouds, PCs, or mobile devices.

Winners in the new landscape include Apple, the king of consumer electronics, with annual revenue of $170 billion. The company makes iPhones, iPads, and hosts through its online stores a wealth of cloud-based software applications. South Korea’s Samsung, the other big winner in smartphones, has dominated the competition, forcing onetime leader Nokia into a sale of its phone business to Microsoft.

In business computing, Amazon’s cloud-based rentals of computer power and software to businesses, Amazon Web Services, has sharply lowered the cost of starting a company and hosts businesses like Netflix, Pinterest, and Airbnb. Many established businesses also use Amazon Web Services, which is estimated to have well over a million computer servers. Google has built online word processing and spreadsheet businesses that threaten Microsoft, and is challenging Amazon Web Services for the corporate cloud business.

HP was long the world’s largest computer company, though there has been much turmoil in recent years. The two businesses resulting from the proposed split almost evenly divide HP’s fiscal 2013 revenue of $112 billion. On their own, both would easily fit in the top half of the Fortune 500.

HP’s split is not the first time the company has hewed itself in two to cope with changing times. In 1999, its test and measurement equipment division was started as a separate company, called Agilent. Shares in Agilent rose 41 percent on their first day, and the company was completely spun off HP in 2000. The stock was already declining by then, however, and today Agilent has a market capitalization about equal with its first day’s value.

Agilent, as the name suggests, was also split off in the interests of agility, at that time in the face of the first Internet boom. While HP benefited in those years from PC and server sales, management also felt the company was not moving fast enough for a changing world.",7824

Both Bentz and Conger were taken off a plane for questioning as they were preparing to leave Rio.

[Breaking news update at 1:18 a.m. ET]

American swimmers Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger have left the Rio airport after being pulled off their plane for questioning, according to a statement from the Untied States Olympic Committee. The pair were part of a group of four US swimmers who reported being robbed.

[Previous story, published at 10:42 p.m. ET]

A 12-time Olympic medal winning swimmer wanted for questioning by Brazilian police returned to the United States before officers could seize his passport to ensure he was available for questioning, officials said Wednesday.

A Brazilian judge has issued a search and seizure warrant for US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte and teammate James Feigen as questions emerge about their account of being robbed at gunpoint early Sunday in Rio de Janeiro.

Two other swimmers, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz, were removed by Brazilian authorities on Wednesday night from their flight before it departed Rio de Janeiro to the United States, US Olympic Committee spokesman Patrick Sandusky told CNN Sports contributor Christine Brennan.

Federal police say Lochte left Brazil on Monday on a commercial flight, two days before the judicial order. Feigen is believed to still be in Brazil.

Lochte said he wouldn't make up a story like this, NBC's Matt Lauer reported Wednesday night. He said Lochte told him he and his three teammates were victims. NBC is broadcasting the Games in Rio.

Lochte compared the way police questioned him to a time in the United States when he talked with police after being robbed, Lauer said. Lochte said the Brazilian police asked few questions during what he thought was a casual interview. Lauer relayed that Lochte said he didn't think police expressed any skepticism over his account.

Police arrived Wednesday morning at the Olympic Village to take the swimmers' passports and gather further testimony from them about the reported robbery, Sandusky said earlier.

But the athletes were not there.

""The swim team moved out of the village after their competition ended, so we were not able to make the athletes available,"" Sandusky said in a statement, adding that the committee would ""continue to cooperate with Brazilian authorities.""

The robbery -- during which one of the bandits was said to have put a gun to Lochte's forehead -- reportedly occurred after the athletes left a party at the French hospitality house. Lochte told Lauer on Wednesday, however, that the gunman pointed the gun at him, but it wasn't against his head.

Civil police say they are still looking for the taxi driver the athletes say they were with when they were robbed. Police say they have asked the driver to come forward.

Lochte's lawyer: He would have stayed

The seizure warrant for the men's passports, if served, would prevent them leaving the country.

Sandusky said that due to security protocols, he could not disclose the swimmers' whereabouts. But Lochte, one of swimming's biggest stars, has already returned to the United States, his attorney Jeff Ostrow told CNN.

Ostrow said Lochte, a gold medal winner in Rio, had ""fully cooperated with the Brazilian authorities while in Rio.""

""He sat for a victim interview with the Brazilian Tourist Police, USOC Security, State Department, FBI, and anyone else that the Brazilian authorities requested to be present,"" he said.

""He left for the United States as he was planning to after he completed his events. He was not asked by the Brazilian authorities to remain in Brazil for further investigation.

""Had they asked, he would have stayed and assisted. They still have not reached out to ask for additional information.""

Earlier Wednesday, the lawyer said that he and Lochte stood by the account provided to authorities.

""We stand by what he provided in that interview and signed off on.""

Judge's questions

But questions remain.

Judge Keyla Blanc De Cnop said police still need more time to assess whether the US swimmers provided false information and if they filled a false crime report.

The judge said the athletes' behavior upon arrival at the Olympic Village -- combined with the inconsistencies in their statements -- led police to question the veracity of their claim.

Judge Blanc De Cnop noted that Lochte had said a single robber approached the athletes and demanded all their money (400 real, or $124).

Feigen's statement said a number of robbers targeted the athletes but only one was armed, the statement said.

Another potential issue highlighted by judge was the behavior of the athletes on arrival at the Olympic Village in the aftermath.

""It seems the alleged victims found their physical and psychological integrity were unshaken, even fooling about with each other,"" said the judge, referring to footage from security cameras in the Olympic Village.

Video emerges

Ryan Lochte competes in a 200-meter individual medley race in Rio.

Public speculation has been fueled by the release of a video obtained by the Daily Mail, which it said was filmed shortly after the robbery.

The video appears to show the four swimmers returning to the Olympic Village looking relatively relaxed, and in possession of high-value items that might be expected to have been taken in an armed robbery.

CNN is unable to authenticate the video.

A spokeswoman for the Civil Police told CNN that the case had attracted attention among Brazilians because the victims said their phones and watches hadn't been taken -- items that would be a prized target for thieves in crime-plagued Rio.

She added that the issuance of search and seizure warrants was not a routine procedure but was sometimes done when concerns arose that information had been withheld.

She said that after Lochte's statement to police, the three other swimmers were asked to present themselves at the police station to give their accounts. So far, only one had done so, she said.

Lochte's harrowing account

Initial reports regarding the robbery were confusing, with an International Olympic Committee spokesman first claiming the reports were ""absolutely not true"" at a press conference Sunday.

He later backtracked and apologized, saying he was relying on initial information from the US Olympic Committee that was incorrect.

Speaking to NBC, Lochte described a harrowing encounter with the thieves.

""We got pulled over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a police badge, no lights, no nothing -- just a police badge and they pulled us over,"" he said.

""They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground -- they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like we didn't do anything wrong, so -- I'm not getting down on the ground.

""And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, 'Get down,' and I put my hands up, I was like 'whatever.' He took our money, he took my wallet -- he left my cell phone, he left my credentials.""",7698

Read her other columns, and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter.

(CNN) I've written before about how I simply don't get how we in the United States remain so squeamish about breast-feeding -- and how despite all the research that 'breast is best,' many U.S. hospitals are still not providing women with breast-feeding support .

If we know -- based on actual scientific studies -- that breast-feeding can provide health benefits to mother and baby, why aren't we doing everything we possibly can to make it easier and more socially acceptable for women who choose to breast-feed?

Maybe a new two-part comprehensive report published Thursday in the medical journal The Lancet and billed as the largest and most detailed analysis of the existing research on breast-feeding around the world will help bring about change in the United States and globally. More than 1,300 studies were reviewed, including some commissioned specifically for this report, which focused on the levels, trends and benefits of breast-feeding.

Think of the health implications alone. Based on new estimates produced for the report, dramatically scaling up breast-feeding to near-universal levels for infants and young children could save 820,000 children's lives a year around the world, preventing 13% of all deaths of children under five.

""Breast milk acts as a baby's first vaccine to help fight disease and illness,"" said Dr. Cesar Victora , emeritus professor of epidemiology at the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, one of the co-authors of the report, in response to questions via email.

One third of respiratory infections and about half of all diarrhea episodes could be avoided in low- and middle-income countries through breast-feeding, according to the report. In high-income countries, breast-feeding cuts the risk of sudden infant deaths by more than one-third.

Children who are breast-fed longer have been found to have higher intelligence than those who are breast-fed for shorter periods, the report said.

""So both for ensuring kids' survival and then ensuring their future health and development, it's a huge intervention,"" said Shawn Baker, director of nutrition for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which provided a $650,000 grant to the World Health Organization to fund the report.

""I always characterize it that this is not some second-rate intervention we're trying to push on developed worlds, but this is really state of the art, the gold standard intervention that's relevant anywhere in the world.""

Mom benefits, too

The health benefits extend to the mother as well, with reductions in risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Based on all the existing research and according to new estimates created for this report, hikes in breast-feeding could prevent an extra 20,000 deaths from breast cancer each year.

And yet, the rate of breast-feeding has been relatively stagnant for the past two decades, and the wealthier the country, the less likely mothers are to breast-feed. Currently, just one in five children in high-income countries are breast-fed to 12 months while one in three children are breast-fed exclusively for the first six months in low- to middle-income countries.

""Breast-feeding is one of the few health and nutrition indicators for which poor countries are closer to international recommendations than rich ones,"" said Victora, who also coordinates the International Center for Equity in Health at the Federal University of Pelotas. For each doubling of a country's gross domestic product per capita, the prevalence of breast-feeding at 12 months drops by 10 percentage points, he said.

""What one is seeing in a number of countries, as they've emerged economically, is that ... perception, 'Well to be modern, one should move from breast-feeding to formula feeding,' and that can have a real knock-on effect of undermining the social norms around breast-feeding,"" said Baker of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

JUST WATCHED TV host: I don't want to see you breast-feeding Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH TV host: I don't want to see you breast-feeding 02:22

Extensive marketing by formula makers remains a big barrier to increase the number of children who are breast-fed, the report said.

While there is an international code that was adopted in 1981 to protect the public from inappropriate marketing strategies, it has not been vigorously enforced, implemented and monitored, the report said. Plus, the report estimates enormous growth in the formula market, with sales projected to reach more than $70 billion in 2019, far more than countries spend to promote and support breast-feeding.

""The fact is that marketing by the infant-feeding industry and the availability of formula, including through the distribution of free samples, result in increased bottle-feeding,"" said Victora, the report's author. ""Formula advertisements portray it as good as or better than breast milk, or present it as a lifestyle choice rather than a decision with health and economic consequences.""

How to change social norms?

It is incredibly important to note right here that some people can't breast-feed for medical reasons, or they physically can't do it or don't feel comfortable breast-feeding. But for the people who are choosing to bottle feed over breast-feeding -- and who might reverse course if they knew more about the benefits -- could anything be done to help influence them to choose breast over bottle?

The report found it is possible to change social norms and behavior, even in emerging economies. For instance, the average duration of breast-feeding in Brazil jumped from 2.5 months in 1974, one of the shortest in any low- or middle-income country, to 14 months by 2006 to 2007.

Brazil rigorously monitored marketing by formula makers and set up a process to certify and recertify hospitals as ""baby friendly,"" meaning they provided breast-feeding supports to new moms, said Victora, one of the lead researchers behind the report. The country also added leave time for parents, he noted -- 120 days for moms and five days for dads, according to the United Nations International Labour Organization

""I do think that if you can see countries like Brazil that can make, with high-level political support, fundamental changes in the social norms throughout the whole system, I think it's probably possible anywhere,"" said Baker of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ""It's creating the right conditions and I think that's what's also very important. You can't say, 'OK, we're just going to focus on the mom' without understanding what context that mom lives in.""

Baker was recently in the field in Bangladesh and says one of the great innovations to change behaviors there are home visits, which include not just the mom, but also the dad and the mother-in-law. A mother's behavior, in any part of the world, can be extremely influenced by what her mother-in-law or her mother says when it comes to child feeding. I'm sure any mother reading this understands that statement immensely.

""So, just speaking to her without trying to address the neighboring environment around her is going to ... not give good results and in fact, sometimes put her in a situation where she'll feel very frustrated because she will want to practice the better feeding behavior, but her mother-in-law or her husband will give contrary advice,"" said Baker.

""I think that looking at the whole system, the environment in which the mom lives and addressing that is really quite important"" in any part of the world, he added.",7667

Thanks for checking this out.

ORIGIN

On 10 May 2016, British outlet The Telegraph reported that a Canadian teenager found a lost Mayan city using satellite mapping:

A Canadian schoolboy appears to have discovered a lost Mayan city hidden deep in the jungles of Mexico using a new method of matching stars to the location of temples on earth. William Gadoury, 15, was fascinated by the ancient Central American civilization and spent hours poring over diagrams of constellations and maps of known Mayan cities. And then he made a startling realisation: the two appeared to be linked … William took to Google Maps and projected that there must be another city hidden deep in the thick jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico[.] “I was really surprised and excited when I realised that the most brilliant stars of the constellations matched the largest Maya cities,” he told the Journal de Montréal. In hundreds of years of scholarship, no other scientist had ever found such a correlation.

That final line gave many readers pause — if the story was accurate, experts studying such history for decades missed the findings of a teenager. The article did little to inspire confidence in the claim’s credibility, noting that the boy’s study focus was inspired by 2012 Mayan doomsday prophecies:

The Canadian Space Agency agreed to train its satellite telescopes on the spot and returned with striking pictures: what appears to be an ancient Mayan pyramid and dozens of smaller structures around it. If the satellite photographs are verified, the city would be among the largest Mayan population centers ever discovered. It fell to William to christen the new city and he chose the name K’aak Chi, meaning Fire Mouth, and the teenager said he hoped to one day see the ruins with his own eyes. “It would be the culmination of my three years of work and the dream of my life,” he said. He became interested in the Mayans after reading about their predictions that the world would end in 2012.

The Telegraph sourced their report from a 7 May 2016 article on French-language web site Journal de Montréal. Both articles made essentially the same claims, with little effort at authenticating them. Both articles, too, lacked information about how such an astonishing discovery was deemed credible — or by whom. The narrative arc was vague and suggested that the boy requested further data from the Canadian Space Agency before connecting the dots himself.

Gawker‘s tech site Gizmodo was one of the first outlets to run with the story, only to later participate in its debunking. An assessment made by University of Southern California anthropologist Thomas Garrison was later added to Gizmodo‘s article in an update. Garrison said that the purported Maya ruins were, in fact, a fallow cornfield:

I applaud the young kid’s effort and it’s exciting to see such interest in the ancient Maya and remote sensing technology in such a young person. However, ground-truthing is the key to remote sensing research. You have to be able to confirm what you are identifying in a satellite image or other type of scene. In this case, the rectilinear nature of the feature and the secondary vegetation growing back within it are clear signs of a relic milpa. I’d guess its been fallow for 10-15 years. This is obvious to anyone that has spent any time at all in the Maya lowlands. I hope that this young scholar will consider his pursuits at the university level so that his next discovery (and there are plenty to be made) will be a meaningful one.

Ivan Šprajc of the Institute of Anthropological and Spatial Studies in Slovenia also voiced skepticism about the purported discovery:

Very few Maya constellations have been identified, and even in these cases we do not know how many and which stars exactly composed each constellation. It is thus impossible to check whether there is any correspondence between the stars and the location of Maya cities. In general, since we know of several environmental facts that influenced the location of Maya settlements, the idea correlating them with stars is utterly unlikely.

Other critiques voiced by archeologists in the wake of the claim’s spread on social media was that the area in which the site was “discovered” was already extensively mapped and excavated:

And no matter what your star map tells you, chances are good you’ll hit upon a settlement in that area. “The Maya area was so densely occupied in Classic Maya times that many years ago a well known archaeologist, Ed Kurjack, told me that the area looked much like the Ohio Valley, denuded of trees and full of towns that were fairly close to one another,” wrote Susan Milbrath, a curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History, in an email. “So at any given point you would be likely to find an archaeological site.” The archaeologist Richard Hansen pointed out that the location appears to be very close to that of the ancient Mayan city of Uxul, which has been under excavation since 2009—not exactly a long-lost city.

Ultimately, while the narrative of a plucky untrained teenager succeeding where the experts failed is always compelling, the “lost Mayan city” report was one of several science claims reported by the media only to be fact-checked by experts after the fact.

However, neither the way the story was reported initially nor its debunking were fully accurate. We spoke to the Daniel de Lisle with the Canadian Space Agency, who worked with William Gadoury on his project.

“We actually met William during the summer of 2014, because at that point [he] won a few science fairs with his project,” de Lisle told us:

So we attended his presentation and realized, this boy is really bright and really organized and had put together this project… and he was wondering why these temples, these pyramids were in odd places. So that’s how it started — he took the constellation maps and overlaid them over the map, and realized the constellations matched. So that’s really what triggered all this work. He realized that one major star did not have a correlation with a city on the map so he said maybe there could be something under neath the vegetation. so that’s really the basis of his research. We invited him to CSA to make a presentation, and he made a really thorough presentation about this. They really were in awe with this 15 year old boy. The other thing we did was provide satellite imagery where he was, and from there I processed the imagery so he could overlay this information…. The satellite imagery showed some edges that didn’t look natural; it showed straight edges. The images we have showed edges that are underneath the vegetation in relief. So he thought that there might be a city underneath the canopy.

William Gadoury’s projected uncovered what they called “an area of interest,” which suggested that there something underneath the vegetation. However, despite news reports to the contrary, the teenager never claimed to have found a lost city; instead, he formed a hypothesis based on available data that he had spent years researching and curating, so that experts could proceed from there.",7609
522321383716818944,true,Texas health officials say 2nd person to test positive for Ebola at Dallas hospital did treat Thomas Eric Duncan: http://t.co/CxY8IH4MET,http://cbsn.ws/1xRM6zM,True,2nd Texas health worker tests positive for Ebola,"A second worker at the Texas hospital where a Liberian man died of Ebola has tested positive for the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said early Wednesday morning.

The agency said the positive result was returned from a preliminary test, and that ""confirmation testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's laboratory is being done.""

The worker was in isolation at a Dallas hospital within 90 minutes of her finding she had an elevated temperature, officials said. They also said she lives alone with no pets.

After revealing her diagnosis, the CDC also announced the health care worker had taken a flight from Cleveland to Dallas the day before presenting symptoms. Officials are trying to track down all 132 passengers aboard.

In response to the latest Ebola case, the White House announced Tuesday that Obama is calling off a planned trip to New Jersey and Connecticut and instead will convene Cabinet officials coordinating the government's Ebola response.

Crews were at the health care worker's apartment early Wednesday morning, located in north Dallas, reports CBS Dallas. They began decontaminating the complex's common areas and the space outside of the patient's home, as well as distributing flyers to residents. The patient's vehicle and apartment unit will be decontaminated starting early Wednesday afternoon.

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said at a news conference Wednesday that the health care provider at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola.

The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed in a separate statement that the health worker did provide care to Thomas Eric Duncan, whom officials refer to as ""the index patient"" and is the Liberian national who died at Presbyterian on Oct. 8. Duncan was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil, although he is believed to have contracted the disease while still in Liberia.

It was not immediately clear what contact the new case had with Duncan.

Officials have said they also don't know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected. But the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said ""an additional health care worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern.""

""What happened there (in Dallas), regardless of the reason, is not acceptable. It shouldn't have happened,"" Anthony Fauci, director of the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of NIH, said on MSNBC Wednesday.

The state health agency said the new patient had been interviewed, ""to quickly identify any contacts or potential exposures, and those people will be monitored. The type of monitoring depends on the nature of their interactions and the potential they were exposed to the virus.""

""We want to remind Dallas County residents not to panic and overreact,"" said county health director Zach Thompson. ""We just want Dallas County residents to stay calm.""

Nurse Nina Pham, the first person to contract Ebola on U.S. soil, also got the disease while caring for Duncan. She repeatedly visited his room from the day he was admitted to the intensive care unit until the day before he died, medical records show.

Pham and other health care workers wore protective gear, including gowns, gloves, masks and face shields -- and sometimes full-body suits -- when caring for Duncan, but confirmation of the new case came a day after a national nurses union decried an absence of protocols at the Texas hospital.

When Pham's mother learned she was caring for Duncan, she tried to reassure her that she would be safe.

Pham told her: ""Mom, no. Don't worry about me,"" family friend Christina Tran told The Associated Press.

Duncan's medical records make numerous mentions of protective gear worn by hospital staff, and Pham herself notes wearing the gear in visits to Duncan's room. But there is no indication in the records of her first encounter with Duncan, on Sept. 29, that Pham donned any protective gear.

Leaders of the National Nurses Union read a statement Tuesday which they said represented concerns from a number of nurses that work at Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas. The union officials declined to identify the Dallas nurses or say how many were participating in the statement.

But they were vociferous in citing a lack of protocols on the day Duncan was admitted with extreme symptoms of Ebola.

Among the flaws cited by the group included:

insufficient garb worn by the emergency personnel

the fact that Duncan was left ""for hours"" in a non-quarantined zone

that his lab samples were sent in the same way that normal specimens are sent

hospital official allowed nurses involved with Duncan to take care of other patients

other ways in which the hospital did not immediately react to the situation.

""Were protocols breached?"" said union spokeswoman Rose Ann DeMoro, ""There were no protocols.""

""These nurses are not well protected. They're not prepared to handle Ebola or any other pandemic,"" said DeMoro. ""We are deeply alarmed.""

DeMoro said the nurses who had come forward were afraid to reveal their identities ""because of a culture of threat in the hospitals.""

Tuesday night, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital issued a statement in response to the nurses' charges, saying, ""patient and employee safety is our greatest priority and we take compliance very seriously.""

The hospital insisted that ""numerous measures"" were in place ""to provide a safe working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7 hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting.""

But also on Tuesday, the nation's top disease-fighting agency acknowledged that federal health experts failed to do all they should have done to prevent Ebola from spreading in Dallas when and after Duncan was admitted.

CDC Director Tom Frieden outlined a series of steps designed to stop the spread of the disease in the U.S., including increased training for health care workers and changes at Texas Health Presbyterian to minimize the risk of more infections. He also said the CDC was forming rapid response teams to intervene wherever an Ebola diagnosis presents itself in the U.S. ""within hours.""

A total of 76 people at the hospital might have had exposure to Duncan, and all of them were being monitored for fever and other symptoms daily, Frieden said. It wasn't immediately confirmed that the new case was one of the 76 people being monitored.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday there haven't been any alterations of the virus that would raise concern about protocols.

With 30 years of treatment and containment ofthe Ebola virus behind them, Burwell said they knew to implement additional oversight to ensure those protocols were implemented this time.

""There will be 24/7 site managers who will oversee the taking on and taking off of equipment, as well as the fact that we've added additional CDC staff on site,"" she said on ""CBS This Morning.""

Another possibility for spreading the disease was the ""the interventions that were done to try desperately to keep the index patient alive, (including) dialysis and intubation. These are two procedures which can result in the spread of infectious material,"" CDC head Frieden said.

Starting Sunday, the CDC began re-evaluating the protocols for using protective gear and limiting the number of Ebola patients a facility can treat, reports CBS News correspondent Vicente Arenas.",7499
531287426858487808,unverified,FEEL GOOD STORY: U.S. airstrikes 'hit ISIS leader'. Terror group chief 'critically wounded' http://t.co/BOboriJ41t http://t.co/ojCsb15d4y,http://m.hilliker.org/1EfIp8y,True,U.S. air strikes 'hit ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi',"They say jihadis emptied hospital and demanded blood donors for wounded

Fighters struck town of al-Qaim on Iraq-Syria border, witnesses said

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said to be among several hurt or killed ISIS leaders

Wounded? Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader the so-called Islamic State, is said to be among those targeted

American war planes have reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS leaders, critically wounding their leader.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hurt in the strikes today, according to local witnesses and government sources.

Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border.

Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people.

Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market.

A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.

Local ISIS officials were reportedly roaming the streets with loudspeakers ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded.

Striking Baghdadi would be the most significant blow yet in the campaign against ISIS, who have been defiant in the face of sustained air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and allies.

A provincial leader from Anbar in western Iraq, as well as his deputy, are said to be among those killed instantly by the bombs.

Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.

The shady figure was eventually released, and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form ISIS, or the Islamic State.

Iraqi security officials could not immediately comment on the reported raid. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny the strike.

Scroll down for video

Attacks: Two strikes were reported, one at al-Qaim, near the Syria-Iraq border, and a second in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul

Separately, the coalition of air forces, which includes Great Britain's RAF and Canadian fighter planes, struck a convoy just outside Mosul, ISIS's stronghold city in northern Iraq.

U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting.

IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.'

Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq

The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war.

It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports.

The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.

On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said.

The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi.

Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source.

'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil.

In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said.

The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official.

There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants.

In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said.

Air strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border

Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.

President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State.

The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported.

SOCCER-LOVING PHD STUDENT WHO BECAME WORLD'S WORST TERRORIST WITH $10 MILLION BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD: WHO IS ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI? Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group. He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history. But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world. The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous. This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'. But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year. Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam. In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends. But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation. American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009. He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast. But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly. After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.

The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda.

Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda.

Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.",7494

Thanks for listening to another week of the Ask Pastor John podcast. We get a lot of really good questions via email, and you can send them to us at askpastorjohn AT desiringGod DOT org.

As you can imagine, Pastor John, we have lots of questions in the inbox about Target’s new transgender bathroom policy. Shoppers are encouraged to use whichever gendered bathrooms they identify with. The Target corporate headquarters is just a walk away from your house, so this hits close to home. On the principle of a boycotts, I think we’ve addressed this (back in episode 430 on corporate policies of Apple, Subaru, Target). What are the logistics of Target’s decision for Christians? If you are shopping at Target, go to the restroom, and a woman, identifying as a man, walks in — are there any biblical principles at play here? Would you use a gender-open restroom, even if it says “men” on the door? How would you untangle this?

Tony, the way my mind went on this may not be exactly where the question is going, although I am going to end precisely answering the question what I would do. But let me take you on the trajectory of my thought and trust that the Lord brought it to my mind for good reasons.

SCOTUS and Parenting

Strange as it may sound, the first thing that comes to my mind as I hear the question is how parents are going to train their children in a culture where profound evil and deep corruption and God-ignoring perversion is pervasive and accepted and defended and assumed and de-stigmatized and statistically normal. That is just so front burner for me right now in conversations that I am having.

“The depths of the human heart’s depravity must be built in profoundly to our children.” Twitter Tweet Facebook Share on Facebook

For those of us who grew up where different standards were assumed and where some at least external biblical patterns of life were normative, there is a built-in revulsion at some things that ought to produce revulsion. But our children are not growing up in that world, and they will not have the same instincts. So how — that is my question — how are we going to raise them and train them so that they will feel the exceeding sinfulness of sin and be willing to take stands that are extremely unpopular, maybe even costly or dangerous?

Part of the answer to that question is whether we have a big enough doctrine of human depravity. Are we able to take our children to the Scriptures and explain to them in terms that are shocking enough where the evils of our society are coming from? The children are going to be told by the Supreme Court and by their teachers and by their friends that the world is a different way, that the words of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy are true.

Here is this sentence. What I am going to read right now, I think, is probably the most destructive sentence, whether it is transgender or so-called gay marriage or abortion. This sentence from 1992 Justice Anthony Kennedy is probably the most destructive sentence that the Court has ever spoken. That would be my guess. I have not read them all, but he said, “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” That view of human autonomy — defining one’s own existence — is so widespread that, unless we have a deeper, stronger, more compelling view of human nature that explains where such sentences come from, our children will simply be swept away and along with the culture.

So that is the first thing that comes to my mind. My first reaction when I hear another instance of the kind of application of Justice Kennedy’s sentence is that the depths of the human heart’s depravity must be built in profoundly to our children.

So-Called “Gender Identity”

The second thing that comes to my mind is just to make sure that we have our terminology right in these days. So Target has now put in place a policy and it goes like this. It aims to give freedom to “transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.” Now there is the new term: gender identity. And it is just so important that all of our listeners get this. That is a new code word.

The word “gender” is now used not for biological reality of maleness or femaleness, but for desired identity of so-called male or so-called female, even if the biological reality is the opposite of the desired identity. So, gender identity can mean a male declaring himself to be female and a female declaring herself to be male. That is what gender identity means. And it is the most recent application and perhaps the strangest of Justice Kennedy’s principle: Liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence.

Always criticizing the world and losing a big vision of God is a greater tragedy than the moral tragedy we are in. Twitter Tweet Facebook Share on Facebook

We are going to talk about polygamy on this podcast one of these days, and my wife was saying last night: Well, that probably isn’t coming. I said: There is not a leg to stand on. Once you have put this sentence in place, polygamy will come and the worst has already come. Polygamy is a piece of cake. That is coming, except that it is probably legally so complicated that, for inheritances and life insurance policies and everything else, maybe there will be some brakes on it for a while anyway.

For this principle to hold, liberty is the right to define one’s own existence. God must be excluded from the picture, because what it means to be God is that God defines for us the nature of our existence. And so the recent developments to presume we can define marriage any way we please and our sexual identity any way we please are manifestations of the human usurpation of divine prerogatives. This is not new, not a new thing. This has been going on for a long time. The correlation between biological maleness and femaleness and self-identification as male and female is rooted in numerous ways in the Bible. It is rooted in God’s creation as male and female. It is rooted in distinct roles assigned to male and female in marriage. It is rooted in the biblical prohibition of homosexual acts.

Target, Transgender, and Bathrooms

So, in answer to the last part of the question, Would you, John Piper, use a gender open restroom even if it says men on the door? My answer is, If I were there and if I had to, I would — just like I would stop on the highway if I had to. But I wouldn’t if I didn’t have to. And the reason I wouldn’t is because I want there to be a small act of protest and life consistency that may have no impact at all on the powers that make such decisions, but that keep my conscience clear and acknowledge God in practical affairs and give a consistency to my life that does help overall in showing the way of Christ to the world.

And I would say just one other thing. I think we should spend most of our creative energies on constructing in our minds and in our hearts and in our families great and beautiful and glorious alternative visions of reality than the ones we are being offered by the world. If we give most of our time to bemoaning and criticizing the world for acting like the world, our vision of God and his glorious future for his people will become smaller and smaller, and that could be a greater tragedy than the one we are living in.

Jihadi John is 'wounded in US airstrike on secret bunker meeting of ISIS high command',"Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office.

The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.

The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets.

The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq

‘We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them,’ a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday.

This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq.

The Foreign Office spokesman added: ‘We have a number of sources of information coming in.

‘The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.’

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ‘We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.’ A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

But until now, Jihadi John’s presence at the meeting has not emerged.

It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.

The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present.

Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff

Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left

According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was ‘the one who slaughtered the journalists’.

It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.

IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque’s loudspeakers, appealing for the town’s residents to donate blood at the hospital.

Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.

The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime’s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade.

Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left

Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal

Jihadi John has become one of the world’s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.

Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.

Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS ‘wilayat’, or province.

IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.

Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.

He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured

The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.

In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.

Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to ‘erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere’.

The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday’s attack.

The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader’s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property.

It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured

Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.

He said: ‘A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.’

The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.

It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.

Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.",7335

Two “despicable attacks” on Canadian soldiers this week will not weaken the country’s resolve to fight terrorism at home and abroad, a sombre Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Wednesday.

Harper addressed the nation hours after a young soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa and dozens of shots fired inside Parliament ended with the shooter’s death.

The attacks in Ottawa occurred just two days after a Quebec soldier was killed in what Harper called an Islamic State-inspired attack in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase.

Harper said more information about the “terrorist” killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday’s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982.

“This week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,” the prime minister said.

“We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,” he said.

“But let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.”

Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada’s resolve and lead the government to “redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.”

National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada’s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS “will continue unimpeded.”

The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was “murdered in cold blood” Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life.

Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings ""a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.""

But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country “blessed by love, diversity and peace.”

RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said.

Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge.

Panic on the Hill

The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial.

When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him.

A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament’s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons.

Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening.

Parliament Hill and Ottawa’s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose.

Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay “vigilant” and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large.

Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed.

Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial.

""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Zobl told CP.

""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""

Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill.

Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting.

“This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,” RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon.

He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate.

“If we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,” he said.

The RCMP also said it’s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government.

Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is “looking for answers.”

The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police.

On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium.

Security beefed up

The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases.

Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they’re not on active duty.

U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered “any assistance” needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council.

Obama also expressed “the American people’s solidarity with Canada,” according to the NSC.

The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them “outrageous.”

“We’re all shaken by it,” he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events.

A statement from NATO’s secretary general also said that “NATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.”

An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of “high-risk travellers” being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized.

The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24,a reservist from Hamilton.

Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.

It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.

CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspectis Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.

He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.

In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.

""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.

""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""

NDP Leader Tom Mulcair andLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.

Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.

Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.

Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.

Caught 'by surprise'

In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""

""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.

Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.

Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.

Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.

Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.

Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""

Chaos and bravery inside Parliament

Alain Merisier, who works at the cafeteria in one of the Parliament Buildings, told CBC News that he saw a man in a car at the Centre Block with a long gun.

CBC video and cellphone video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed a chaotic scene in the elegant hallway leading from the front doors of Parliament's Centre Block to the Library of Parliament during the attack.

A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.

In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:

NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, former head of the Ontario Provincial Police and ex-Toronto chief of police: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.""

Justice Minister Peter MacKay: ""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes.""

Eyewitness accounts

524946179390701568,true,LATEST UPDATE: Attacker shot dead in Parliament after soldier shot at National War Memorial http://t.co/pp6hcfWcRw http://t.co/HxODwIZfj6,http://www.cbc.ca/1.2808710,True,"Ottawa shooting: A day of chaos leaves soldier, gunman dead","Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an evening address that Canada would not be intimidated by Wednesday's ""brutal and violent attack"" in Ottawa, in which an armed attacker shot and fatally wounded a Canadian Forces member at the National War Memorial before being shot dead in Parliament's Centre Block.

The slain soldier is Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24,a reservist from Hamilton.

Moments after Cirillo was shot at his post by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, MPs and other witnesses reported 30 to 50 shots fired inside the main Parliament building.

It was confirmed later that the gunman was shot dead inside the building, felled by the House of Commons sergeant-at-arms and RCMP, according to MPs' accounts.

CBC News has confirmed the dead shooting suspectis Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982. CBC News has learned that Zehaf-Bibeau has a criminal record in Quebec dating back 10 years on some drug-related charges. Court documents from that time show that he lived at an address in Montreal.

He also has a criminal record in B.C., where he was convicted in 2012 of uttering threats and served one day in jail.

In his brief address, Harper offered condolences for Cirillo's family, and for the family of Patrice Vincent, another soldier who was killed in an attack earlier this week.

""For the second time this week, there has been a brutal and violent attack on our soil,"" he said.

""But let there be no misunderstanding — we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated.""

NDP Leader Tom Mulcair andLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau delivered their own statements, condemning the attacks and pledging support for the government.

Harper, who was on Parliament Hill at the time of the shooting and was safely whisked away, met with members of his cabinet before making his address. He then met with the Conservative caucus, who had been in lockdown on the Hill until after 8 p.m. ET.

Harper's spokesman Carl Vallée said on Twitter that Harper also spoke briefly to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday afternoon. Harper also spoke with Mulcair and Trudeau, the Prime Minister's Office said.

Hundreds of people, including children at a daycare, waited hours to be evacuated from Parliament Hill as the area remained under lockdown. Late Wednesday OC Transpo buses began taking people away from the Hill as the lockdown eased.

Caught 'by surprise'

In an afternoon news conference, police would not say whether they still suspect another shooter is involved, saying only ""there is no one in custody at this time.""

""This is a dynamic and unfolding situation,"" said RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the national division.

Michaud also suggested that police had no forewarning of the attack, saying ""it caught us by surprise."" He added that it's too soon to say whether the dead gunman was already known to security officials.

Michaud added that police have maintained a ""medium"" level of security of Parliament for the past number of years, and that had not changed in recent days.

Ottawa police Chief Charles Bordeleau asked witnesses to the incidents to come forward.

Ottawa Civic Hospital confirmed four people were taken to hospital: the soldier who died, and three who were released after treatment for minor injuries. One of those injured was a parliamentary security guard shot in the foot, according to CBC's Judy Trinh.

Despite earlier reports of shots fired near the Rideau Centre shopping mall east of Parliament Hill, police later said ""no incident occurred near the Rideau Centre.""

Chaos and bravery inside Parliament

Alain Merisier, who works at the cafeteria in one of the Parliament Buildings, told CBC News that he saw a man in a car at the Centre Block with a long gun.

CBC video and cellphone video shot by a Globe and Mail reporter showed a chaotic scene in the elegant hallway leading from the front doors of Parliament's Centre Block to the Library of Parliament during the attack.

A sustained volley of shots was fired. Startled security personnel and political staff scrambled to take cover in the limestone alcoves as bullets flew.

In the minutes after the shooting, MPs and parliamentary staff began tweeting and telling reporters that it was Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers who shot the gunman. The tweets included:

NDP MP Craig Scott: ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.""

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino, former head of the Ontario Provincial Police and ex-Toronto chief of police: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.""

Justice Minister Peter MacKay: ""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes.""

Eyewitness accounts

Earlier, police sealed off the area around the National War Memorial while the injured soldier was given emergency medical aid.

""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" said Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist visiting downtown Ottawa from Holland.

""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair … with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill,"" he said.

Raivo Nommick, another bystander, said ""all of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle .... and just pow pow.

""Then I saw one of the other Armed Forces guys just running. He barrelled over, just ran right over. The other guy just dropped. I looked back and just dived underneath and immediately called 911.""

Earlier, police sealed off the area around the National War Memorial while the injured soldier was given emergency medical aid.

""We were waiting there for a city tour and suddenly I heard four shots,"" said Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist visiting downtown Ottawa from Holland.

""Suddenly I saw a small guy with long black hair … with a long rifle, and he ran away after the shots, across streets in the direction of Parliament Hill,"" he said.

Raivo Nommick, another bystander, said ""all of a sudden, I just heard a shot, turned around and there was a guy with a rifle .... and just pow pow.

""Then I saw one of the other Armed Forces guys just running. He barrelled over, just ran right over. The other guy just dropped. I looked back and just dived underneath and immediately called 911.""

Scott Walsh, who was working on Parliament Hill, said he saw a man running with a double-barrelled shotgun, wearing a scarf and blue jeans.

Walsh said the man hopped over the stone fence that surrounds Parliament Hill, forcing someone out of their car at gunpoint. He then drove to the front doors of Parliament and fired at least two shots, Walsh said.

New Democrat MP Hélène Laverdière said she heard 20 to 30 shots inside Parliament, and hit the floor. She and fellow MPs Charlie Angus and Rosane Doré Lefebvre were later led out of the Centre Block to safety.

MP Doré Lefebvre worried about getting her daughter from the daycare facility on Parliament Hill. Children from the daycare were not released until about 8 p.m.

Intelligence source identifies the wife as Saja al-Dulaimi

Several U.S. sources suggest the person arrested is al-Baghdadi's ex-wife

Little is known about al-Baghdadi; U.S. offers $10 million for info leading to him

Lebanese authorities have arrested a wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- the man spearheading the Islamist terror group's sweeping rampage across Syria and Iraq -- said a source with knowledge of the arrest.

The woman is one of al-Baghdadi's two wives. Her arrest came as part of a ""planned operation,"" according to the source.

The source described her as a ""powerful figure (who is) heavily involved in ISIS."" Not much is known about the reported wife, including what her involvement is with the terrorist group, if any.

""We will gain some intelligence from her. We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat.

Another intelligence source identified the wife as Saja al-Dulaimi. She was detained with her 4-year-old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter Lebanon, that source said.

The arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, said the intelligence source. The source said the Iraqis had help from U.S. intelligence. In Washington, the CIA declined to comment.

Also in Washington, several American sources suggested the person arrested was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one.

JUST WATCHED ISIS leader's wife 'arrested' in Lebanon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH ISIS leader's wife 'arrested' in Lebanon 03:11

Al-Baghdadi has been calling for the release of his son, the intelligence source said, adding that al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody in March as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in exchange for a group of Syrian nuns.

The Greek Orthodox nuns had been kidnapped and held captive by the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which al-Baghdadi had helped establish.

Lebanese authorities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNN.

Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified Lebanese security officials, reported one of al-Baghdadi's sons was detained. But Reuters, also citing Lebanese officials, said that a daughter, rather than a son, was being held.

The two agencies similarly differed on when the two were picked up by Lebanese forces: Reuters said it happened ""in recent days;"" AFP reported it was 10 days ago.

Regardless, the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of al-Baghdadi is significant, given his pivotal role in ISIS' meteoric rise, the extremist group's widely reviled tactics under his leadership and the breadth of the international coalition aimed at defeating ISIS.

""It's certainly a new dynamic because we've never seen anybody connected so close to al-Baghdadi being detained,"" terrorism expert Sajjan M. Gohel said.

At the same time, the reports raise a lot of questions, such as what the family members might have been doing in Lebanon.

""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"" asked Gohel, who is the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation.

Lebanon is one of several countries heavily affected by Syria's yearslong conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence.

Lebanese authorities ""have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of ISIS seeping into Lebanon,"" Gohel said. ""They don't want the problems spilling over from Iraq and Syria into their territory.""

Another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with ISIS.

""If she's simply an ex-wife, the first thing you got to deal with is she's an innocent person, potentially, who was married to a bad guy, with a child,"" said Philip Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official.

""The first hurdle ... before we deal with what she knows, is how closely was she affiliated, and how hard can you press her based on that affiliation. That's an ethical question,"" he said.

ISIS rises after al-Baghdadi took over

The group that in 2006 would become ISIS began in Iraq, where it targeted the U.S.-led coalition as well as Shiite Muslims in the country.

It suffered heavy losses, but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a void wrought by Syria's civil war as well as instability in Iraq.

Not coincidentally, this all happened after al-Baghdadi took over ISIS in 2010.

Before that, he'd been at a U.S. prison camp for insurgents at Bucca in southern Iraq, where he was taken after being detained in February 2004 amid fighting in the flashpoint city of Falluja.

Media reports have claimed U.S. authorities held al-Baghdadi for four years. But the Pentagon has offered a different time line, saying he was at Camp Bucca until early December 2004, when officials there recommended his ""unconditional release.""

Beyond this, little is known about al-Baghdadi. According to the U.S. government, he was born in Samarra, Iraq, and is in his early 40s. What motivates him, how he was trained and who he's close to -- including his family -- largely remains a mystery.

He has emerged from the shadows in fits and spurts.

After the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, al-Baghdadi issued a eulogy in which he threatened violent retribution. (Al Qaeda disowned ISIS earlier this year, blaming it for ""the enormity of the disaster that afflicted"" others trying to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.)

There were unconfirmed suggestions last month that al-Baghdadi had been wounded in airstrikes in northern Iraq.

But days later, an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from al-Baghdadi saying the U.S.-led coalition to destroy ISIS is ""terrified, weak and powerless.""

'He's created this myth'

ISIS itself has never been more powerful, having taken over vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria in the past few years. And it has used brutal tactics to do so -- such as mass kidnappings, rapes, killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting foes alike, actions that a U.N. panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Al-Baghdadi, who has gone by a variety of aliases during his career in terrorism, has been at the center of it. The U.S. State Department's Reward's for Justice program, which refers to him as ""Abu Du'a,"" offers $10 million for information leading to his arrest.

When his group rebranded itself as the Islamic State in June, al-Baghdadi was tapped as spiritual leader of the new caliphate.

He's sought to burnish his theological credentials, with a biography posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from a university in Baghdad.

""His knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence is somewhat dubious, but nevertheless he's created this myth and this aura behind him,"" Gohel said.",7174

Police have confirmed that the incident involved a single gunman, who killed Corporal Cirillo at the base of the memorial before driving to Parliament's Central Block, where he was killed in an exchange of fire with police and security staff. The shooting suspect has been identified as 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau from Quebec.

531543620856197121,unverified,"Islamic State leader al-Baghdadi wounded in airstrikes, Iraqi officials say http://t.co/mCVu82r4EC #ISIS http://t.co/UIF7U0IMnB",http://fxn.ws/1uPdQqz,True,Pentagon officials skeptical over Iraqi claims of wounded Islamic State leader,"Pentagon officials expressed skepticism Sunday over Iraqi claims that airstrikes wounded the head of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Iraq's Defense and Interior ministries both issued statements Sunday afternoon saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded in western Anbar province, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night. Pentagon officials, however, said they had no immediate information on such an attack or whether the militant leader was injured.

But a defense official told Fox News that the Iraqi airstrikes on Saturday were not targeting the senior leadership of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, or ISIL, and that if they hit al-Baghdadi, it would have been a matter of luck. Iraq has virtually no air force and a reputation for exaggeration, the defense official added.

Air Force Col. Pat Ryder, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., told Fox News on Sunday afternoon he was unable to confirm Iraq's reports.

""We have no information to corroborate press reports that (Islamic State) leader al-Baghdadi has been injured,"" he said.

A counterterrorism source who tracks terrorist social media, however, told Fox News on Sunday that there was a spike in chatter from accounts linked to known ISIS members and followers. The messages said al-Baghdadi had been killed or injured in the airstrikes, but some accounts alleged that it was a rumor designed by the U.S. to force al-Baghdadi to make a ""proof of life"" assertion and reveal more information about his location.

The posts indicate that ISIS followers on the web are confused about their leader's fate, the counterterrorism source said.

[pullquote]

The reports came at a time when President Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against ISIS.

Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of Al Qaeda into an independent transnational military force.

He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.

A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defense Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of Islamic State leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.

Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.

The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a vehicle convoy of 10 armed trucks and two checkpoints of the militant group. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.

Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.

""They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,"" Abdurrahman said.

There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.

The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.

Since then, part of ISIS's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.

On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.

The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.

Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.

In an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.

""Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offense,"" Obama said.

""The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" he added.

Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.

The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a vehicle convoy of 10 armed trucks and two checkpoints of the militant group. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.

Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.

""They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,"" Abdurrahman said.

There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.

The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.

Since then, part of ISIS's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.

On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.

The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.

Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.

In an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.

""Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offense,"" Obama said.

""The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" he added.

633397936563560449,non-rumor,10 ways lean startup methodology can impact your business http://t.co/Y0v5YKDHBD by @scottgerber,http://w.readwrite.com/1Ey3oUL,True,10 Ways Lean Startup Methodology Can Impact Your Business,"Guest author Scott Gerber is the founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council.

Lean startup methodology—rapidly building and testing, iterating on your product and releases and validating what you’ve learned—can help you get to market quicker and avoid developing a product no one wants. That’s the goal, at least.

But what’s the impact on a real, functioning business? How do founders apply lean thinking in a practical way? Ten startup founders from YEC weigh in about how lean startup methodology impacted their businesses, for better or worse.

1. Helps Us Constantly Evolve

Build, measure, and learn are critical steps, though I often see startups overlook the “measure” and “learn” steps and instead do something like, “build,” “spend,” and “keep spending.” It’s critical to constantly evaluate your success and refine your processes and products. ZinePak is a service-based and product-based business—clients hire us to create products collaboratively with them—so it’s imperative that we’re constantly measuring our success and learning how to do things better. We have a formal debrief after every project to discuss what went right, what went wrong and what we can do better the next time around. Processes are like languages: In order to be most useful, they’ve got to be flexible enough to constantly evolve and change to meet an ever-changing environment. —Brittany Hodak, ZinePak



2. Keeps Away the Pressure From Debt

We were lucky enough as a consulting company to launch our services with very minimal capital investment and zero debt. The good side is that we don’t have to look over our shoulders and worry about meeting payment deadlines. We don’t answer to anyone and are able to make decisions based on the long term goals of the business. The bad side is that we weren’t able to invest in new technology and grow as quickly as possible. However, the organic growth from reinvestment has allowed us to scale in a more controlled manner without sacrificing quality. —Josh Fuhr, Auditrax

3. Prevents Us Being Stuck on One Idea

In a lean startup, everything gets tried and tested, and the possibility of the whole company pivoting is probable. If you get stuck on developing one idea, then you will hold the whole company back. Having a developer say they want something their way because that is the way the do things is not the right answer. You have to find a team that is willing to accept their failures fast and move on. —Murray Newlands, Due.com

4. Causes Some Fragmentation

Small, independent experiments can often be hard to integrate into a broader perspective. With incorporating both lean and agile methodologies, we’ve often had to take some time to put the puzzle pieces together to paint a larger picture. Breaking down problems and creating discrete experiments has been really positive, but melding and prioritizing the solutions has been a challenge. —Dan Pickett, Launch Academy

5. Helps Fend Off Risk In a Volatile Market

When I started my business, I vowed to do so with as few external resources as possible. I have a small office with little overhead and only a few essential employees. I employ only the technology I absolutely need and don’t implement anything unless there’s a clear business case for it. My sales levels have bounced around a great deal over the last few years, but my lean methodology means I haven’t had to worry that the business would go under. No matter what the market has thrown at me, I have been able to sustain a comfortable level of profit. I think if I had scaled up too quickly or had too grandiose a vision, I would have had to start over at some point, losing significant momentum. —Alexandra Levit, Inspiration at Work

6. Keeps Us Tight

When I first started my journey as an entrepreneur and business owner, I was given two pieces of great advice by my mentors: 1) “Keep costs at a minimum and drive revenue,” and 2) “It’s always better to be on the revenue side of the business rather than the expenses.” These two tips have enabled us to grow into a million-dollar business within just a year, as we strictly focused on sales while keeping costs at the absolute minimum of what we needed to stay operational. —Engelo Rumora, Ohio Cashflow

7. Doesn’t Help with Building Culture

We’ve kept operating costs low from the beginning by bootstrapping, and we’re continually focusing on improving our product, so lean methodology works well for us there. But there’s no way to quantify the importance of company culture within the lean startup methodology. Where does asking someone about their day or expressing concern for their well-being fit into discussions of efficiency and continuous improvement? However, team cohesiveness and employee morale are some of the most important assets for any company to have. That’s why I remind myself it’s important to step back from improving processes to consider the human element of my business. Investing time there might not seem efficient at first, but it’s one of the smartest long-term strategies for building a great team. —Jared Brown, Hubstaff

8. Encourages Us to Be Agile

Because we have a strong product culture, we have adopted several techniques to help us build an agile marketing organization. Instead of long, involved plans, we challenge our team to keep it light and move quickly. We encourage testing, failing and iterating. And we use Trello, a kanban tool, to track marketing projects. It provides great visibility and allows us to reprioritize on the fly. —Vivek Sharma, Movable Ink

9. Keeps Us Efficient

I always encourage my team to find the most efficient and simplest way to do everything and anything. This methodology allows you to avoid cutting costs and corners that may harm your business; instead, you are simply finding the best way from point A to point B. For example, when dealing with clients I have my employees do everything possible on their behalf before speaking with them. This saves time and money because they aren’t wasting hours calling our clients to get more information. Efficiency is a double win; it not only saves us time but also increases customer satisfaction. My customers are much happier when we are doing everything we can to help them. —Elle Kaplan, LexION Capital

10. Helps Us Continuously Better Our Service

One way that this methodology has had a huge impact on Guzu is continuous validation and testing of new products, services, or features. We don’t have the time or money to take too large of a risk without testing and validating that it is a good fit for us. A large part of our risk comes in marketing our site, which is a challenge more startups face. We focus on small, concentrated trial periods on all marketing campaigns. If the campaign provides positive results, we’ll continue to scale that channel; if not, we’ll quickly eliminate it from our portfolio. It’s important to be cautious of your finances as a startup, and stretch your money wisely. —Hesam Meshkat, Guzu

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called into a St. Louis radio show last week with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""",7005

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called into a St. Louis radio show last week with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""",7005

701175292937707520,unverified,"""Sanders won 54% of the Latino vote, according to the sample data, compared to Clinton’s 43%."" #NVcaucus https://t.co/Z0OfPorjLc",http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/hillary-clinton-nevada-caucuses-win-bernie-sanders-democrats-us-election-2016,True,Clinton regains momentum after win over Sanders in Nevada,"As Democratic race heads to South Carolina, Clinton says ‘the fight is on’, and Sanders strikes an upbeat tone in concession speech

Donald Trump wins South Carolina primary, opening clear path to nomination Read more

Hillary Clinton defeated Bernie Sanders in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, in a much-needed victory that nonetheless revealed vulnerabilities in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.



With the majority of precincts reporting, Clinton had 52.7% of the vote, to Sanders’ 47.2%. After a race that initially appeared to be neck-and-neck, the result was called by the Associated Press shortly after 2.20pm local time.

The former secretary of state will seize on her win in the desert state as the start of her comeback in the Democratic race, in which she was first held to an effective tie by Sanders in Iowa and then was easily defeated by him in New Hampshire.

Also on Saturday, the Republicans have been voting in South Carolina, where Donald Trump is expected to win, although his poll lead has narrowed in recent days.

There were ecstatic scenes at the Clinton victory party. “Some may have doubted us but we never doubted each other,” Clinton told supporters at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas.

She congratulated Sanders on a hard-fought race, but added a barely-concealed criticism of her adversary. “The truth is, we aren’t a single-issue country,” she said. “We need more than a plan for the big banks; the middle class needs a raise.”

“I am on my way to Texas, Bill is on his way to Colorado,” she said, in a nod to the slew of crucial primary contests due to take place on 1 March, known as Super Tuesday. “The fight is on, the future that we want is within our grasp.”

The reference in her speech to Bill Clinton coincided with the former president’s increasing role in the family campaign to retake the White House. In a pointed campaign moment in Nevada, Bill Clinton locked horns with Sanders, implicitly comparing his populism to that of the conservative Tea Party. The Vermont senator hit back, attacking the former president’s trade deals, Wall Street deregulation and “so-called welfare reforms”.

In his concession speech on Saturday, Sanders struck an upbeat tone, claiming “the wind is at our backs” despite the defeat in Nevada – pointing out how far his opponent’s lead in the Nevada polls had shrunk. “Five weeks ago, we were 25 points behind in the polls,” he said. “We have made some real progress.”

He added: “I believe on Super Tuesday we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.”

Clinton’s win comes with at least 19 of Nevada’s 35 delegates, adding to her already significant lead in that count, mostly from the support of superdelegates.

The Democratic race will first head to South Carolina, where Clinton has enjoyed a formidable 20-point lead in recent polls, and where her backing from African Americans, a key demographic in the state, is stronger than her support from Latinos.

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton battle for votes in Nevada – in pictures Read more

The Clinton camp hoped that her disappointing showing in the predominantly white early nominating states would quickly be erased once the nomination process moved to states like Nevada and South Carolina, which have a more mixed ethnic and racial makeup.

That turned out to be only partly true in Nevada. Even though Clinton clinched the vote by a comfortable margin, NBC exit poll data indicated she had actually lost the vote of the state’s key demographic of Latino voters. Sanders won 53% of the Latino vote, according to the sample data, compared to Clinton’s 45%. That is a worrying result for Clinton, who has staked her campaign on the promise of winning minority voters.

Some Latino voters, particularly younger people and low-wage workers, appeared to be opting for Sanders in the final weeks of the campaign. In the final 48 hours of the campaign, the Clinton camp ramped up a negative push against Sanders, questioning his commitment to Latinos and portraying the former secretary of state as the obvious heir to the diverse coalition that elected Barack Obama.

In the end Clinton’s strength among women, older voters and African Americans – as well as those who said they were looking for experience in their nominee – proved decisive.



“I love that she’s a woman,” said Darlene Gerson, an attorney caucusing for Clinton at Del Webb middle school in Henderson, in southeast Las Vegas. “I agree with the vast majority of her views. She knows what she’s doing. If anyone can compromise, she can. She’s hugely more electable.”

Nevada’s result lends weight to that view, and shifts momentum behind Clinton’s campaign at a critical juncture.

For the Sanders campaign, Saturday’s result in Nevada will be considered a setback, but not one without positive signs, having significantly dented the lead of a candidate once considered the party’s presumed nominee.



Even if Sanders wins the popular vote, Clinton could still get the nomination Read more

In a repeat of Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had his strongest showing amid young people, who have flocked to his promise of tuition-free college and a platform of radical political and economic change in America.

In the northern city of Reno, where Sanders performed more strongly, there was overwhelming support for the senator at the University of Nevada caucus site.

“I know that the campus culture here is all about Bernie Sanders,” said Olivia Komanduri, an 18-year-old student supporting Clinton, adding she was disappointed but not surprised that she lost there. “They love the idea of a political revolution, they want someone who is different like Bernie, but they don’t understand that Hillary is different, too.”

The Democratic race still remains tight, with Clinton and Sanders each having won one state and effectively tying in the other.

But after a disappointing start to her 2016 campaign, Clinton will claim momentum is now on her side. In addition to her lead in South Carolina, which holds its Democratic primary later this month, Clinton appears to be ahead in other states voting in early March.

She is leading in 10 of the 12 states that will hold Democratic primaries between 1 and 8 March, benefiting from overwhelming support of black voters, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released this week.

“Senator Sanders has run a very good campaign,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign’s director of communications. “He speaks very passionately to a lot of the anger - justifiably so - that people feel here. But we think that the longer the campaign goes on the more apparent it becomes as she makes her argument that she has solutions that will actually work and make a difference in people’s lives for all the barriers that hold them back.”",6989
693140568143220736,non-rumor,Jack White and Avett Brothers premiered a six-part music doc at #Sundance. Our report https://t.co/WRa0rJ63qr https://t.co/fh0RGyyWkv,http://rol.st/20y5gsX,True,"Jack White, Avett Brothers Introduce 'American Epic' Doc at Sundance","Jack White knows which direction his obsessions with American folk, blues and country steered him as an artist. ""When you get back to Howlin' Wolf, Charley Patton, Robert Johnson – it basically begins there, and that's the best it ever was and the best it's ever going to be,"" White declared Thursday night onstage at the Sundance Film Festival, following a preview of the ambitious six-hour American Epic documentary series for PBS.

Related Jack White, T Bone Burnett Produce 'American Epic' Music Doc Beck, Willie Nelson, Nas, Elton John, Avett Brothers and more contributed to project, which also includes a feature film and album series

Along with Sundance founder Robert Redford, White and producer/musician T Bone Burnett are executive producers of American Epic, which recounts how early recording devices captured a variety of regional sounds for the first time — from Delta blues to Hawaiian, Cajun to folk — and established the foundation of what became modern popular music. ""I've often remarked that music to the United States is as wine is to France,"" Burnett told Rolling Stone. ""It's one of those never-ending stories.""

The screening drew a full house to the Eccles Theatre in Park City, Utah, where Redford introduced a 45-minute excerpt that included a look at the life and influence of Mississippi John Hurt. In 1928, Hurt released several songs for the Okeh label before going silent for 35 years and working as a sharecropper, until his rediscovery during the early Sixties folk movement. He was tracked down at home in tiny Avalon, Mississippi, by young musicologist Dick Spottswood, who recounts telling Hurt: ""Don't you know how famous you are?"" Hurt didn't even have a guitar.

Making the documentary ""was like a journey of discovery to find out what was exactly the most important thing in recording music, and the things we most value,"" director Bernard MacMahon said of the project, which he co-created with producers Allison McGourty and Duke Erikson. (PBS will broadcast the series in the fall.) ""Its immediacy and energy and a moment, what they used to call 'lightning in a bottle.'""

""I've often remarked that music to the United States is as wine is to France. It's one of those never-ending stories.""— T Bone Burnett

At the podium, Redford said the documentary shares a history of sound recordings that ""allowed America to hear itself, telling stories about America itself. It started in small pockets in this country and then it spread.""

In the late 1920s, Burnett said, ""the record industry collapsed because radio had proliferated in the big cities and people could get music for free; [they] didn't want to pay for it anymore. So the record companies went down South and began recording the poorest people in the country, which led to this extraordinary explosion of blues, country music and rock & roll ... everything we know today.""

The screening included a look at how the mournful ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground"" by Blind Willie Johnson was chosen among other recordings by NASA to represent humanity and soar across the cosmos onboard the Voyager space probes launched in 1977. There was also a glimpse of the series' final chapter, where Burnett and White gather contemporary musicians from the Alabama Shakes to Elton John to record with the same ancient equipment, including the very first amplifier, first condenser microphone and acetate cutting machine.

Lo-Max Films/Sundance

White and his band were shown gathered around a single microphone singing the obscure country-folk tune ""Matrimonial Intentions"" (""If you got no matrimonial intentions, keep your hands to yourself!""), with fiddle, mandolin, upright bass and White's well-worn acoustic guitar. He's joined by Nas for ""On the Road Again,"" which sounds like some tough contemporary hip-hop except that it's a faithful reading of the original 1928 lyrics by the Memphis Jug Band. It was cut straight to the mic and the lathe, no overdubs.

""I love that kind of recording because you bring all of your focus and attention to bear on a moment,"" Burnett said before the screening. ""That's the [point] when the sculptor hits the chisel. That's a beautiful thing. So many of the great records were made that way, including right now.""

In the documentary, White described the atmosphere: ""You come prepared for this moment. It was like going to church.""

""Radio was the new kid on the block, and they were saying, 'Nobody's going to buy records if they get it for free on the radio!' Hey, is there a familiar echo?""— Taj Mahal

The film excerpt was followed by a panel discussion with MacMahon, Burnett, White and bluesman Taj Mahal, who compared record industry woes past and present. ""Radio came along, and radio was the new kid on the block, and they were saying,"" Mahal said, adding in a whiny voice, ""'Nobody's going to buy records if they get it for free on the radio!' Hey, is there a familiar echo? 'Who's going to buy a CD if they get it for free on the Internet?' How much money did they make in between then and now?""

British-born MacMahon relocated to Los Angeles to complete the three-year process of making the film, commissioned by public television station WNET in New York and the BBC. ""When you go into the most rural parts of America, you see old Celtic traditions that remind you of your great-grandparents,"" the onetime music video director said. ""I see reflections of a society that is almost gone in Britain, and that was really beautiful. There are parts of America that are largely unchanged, so this is a chance to tell some of their stories.""

Both Mahal and the Avett Brothers, who also appear in the documentary, performed short sets after the screening. As he prepared to perform two folk-blues songs on a copper acoustic guitar, Mahal recalled meeting Hurt near the end of the elder bluesman's life, a moment included in the film. ""I went to see Mississippi John Hurt when I was 19. Now I'm up there,"" the 73-year-old said with a laugh.

Related The Avett Brothers' Long Road The hard-won triumph of America's biggest roots band

The Avett Brothers performed three songs in stripped down mode, starting with ""Jordan is a Hard Road to Travel,"" first recorded by Uncle Dave Macon in 1927, and performed by them in film. It was followed by the gospel hymn ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee,"" with three of them around the mic, singing to Seth Avett's acoustic guitar. (The Avetts also performed with a full band at the screening's rousing afterparty-concert at Park City Live.)

On their way into the screening, singer-banjo-player Scott Avett told Rolling Stone: ""We heard about that machine and thought that sounded amazing. The whole group has an interest in old-time music. We perform it in our shows, we perform it on our bus and hotels. When we first heard a playback, our minds were just blown.""

Seth Avett added: ""I think there is something in people that connects with their soul when they hear acoustic instruments. It's not filtered.""",6987

Former aide said Russia's prime minister will be replaced by Sergei Ivanov

It comes as the Kremlin fends off allegations of an impending coup

Her stay at the hospital has been linked to recent disappearance of Putin

Vladimir Putin has appeared on television for the first time in a week amid health fears and suggestions that he is being subject to a coup, while rumours persist that his 31-year-old 'girlfriend' is about to give birth.

Putin, 62, had cancelled several planned meetings during the week leading to speculation over his health and even claims that he was fighting to retain his position.

Channel NTV showed footage of Putin meeting with supreme court president Vyacheslav Lebedev, which it claims was shot on Friday.

According to Putin's staff, he was discussing judicial reform and the likely increase in the number of bankruptcies as as result of Russia's economic collapse.

Putin is due to meet with the president of Kyrgyzstan in St Petersburg on Monday according to the Kremlin.

The Russian president was last seen in public on March 5.

For the past week, the Russian government has been reluctantly answering questions about Putin's health and suggestions that his unofficial girlfriend Alina Kabayeva had checked into a Swiss maternity clinic.

Rumours about 31-year-old Alina Kabayeva surfaced with reports in Switzerland, Italy and Russia suggesting the gymnast had either given birth or was about to do so.

It comes amid increased speculation over what has happened to Putin with the Russian leader not having been seen for a week.

Alluring: Many Russians consider Alina Kabayeva the country's undeclared First Lady

The claims focused on an elite clinic in Lugano, in the Italian region of the neutral country, with some accounts saying she had a new daughter.

Putin's spokesman - who has never confirmed a relationship between the 62 year old strongman and the Olympic gold-medal winner - insisted: 'Information about the birth of Vladimir Putin's child does not correspond to reality.'

The Russian embassy in Kiev refused to comment on a report on the speculation in newspaper Blick.

Russian Tatler yesterday repeated gossip that Kabayeva has two children already by Putin but adds there is no official confirmation.

Kabayeva has been largely out of sight since quitting as an MP in Putin's United Russia party last September, when she took over as head of a major media conglomerate.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin today issued a new picture showing Putin meeting the chairman of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev at his out-of-Moscow residence Novo-Ogaryovo.

The image was meant to scotch suggestions that Putin was not at work amid speculation over a coup or illness.

However, there were immediate claims the picture and TV footage was old, and that it was further evidence of his mystery absence.

Current rumours in Moscow include Putin suffering a stroke, or an unfolding palace coup, following his sudden cancellation of a scheduled trip to Kazakhstan.

With Moscow in febrile mood, a former senior aide to the strongman claimed another ex-KGB spy is being urgently lined up to take over from him.

The theory suggests the Kremlin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov - a former defence minister - will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre Dmitry Medvedev.

After this switch, dubbed a 'conspiracy of generals', Putin - currently the subject of swirling rumours over his health after not being seen in public for more than a week - would be swiftly ousted.

Under the Russian constitution, in the event of a president leaving office, the prime minister replaces him in an acting role pending elections.

This latest forecast of an imminent sea change in Russian politics came from Andrei Illarionov, Putin's former chief economics aide, who last year predicted Putin's land grab against Ukraine three weeks before it happened.

While the Kremlin insists Putin is healthy and in full control of his government, Illarionov claimed: 'In the next few days we should expect the resignation of prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, and Sergei Ivanov being appointed in his place.'

After this, 'the public is likely to be informed that the national leader (Putin) needs a well deserved rest'.

It has been claimed Russia's former defence minister Sergei Ivanov (pictured) will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre Dmitry Medvedev

Observers note that in recent days, Ivanov - who retained the military rank of colonel general and whose eldest son was killed in a mysterious drowning accident in Dubai last November - has been little seen in public.

And Medvedev, who served as president for four years to 2012, is also out of the limelight.

Some Kremlin-watchers say that Western sanctions have created huge tensions inside Putin's fractious entourage in recent weeks, with cash streams closed off.

The murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov - branded a 'provocation' by Putin - has only intensified the infighting with blame for his slaying blamed on the president's close allies in Chechnya.

Illarionov, a senior follow at the Cato Institute in Washington, earlier alleged a cover-up by the Russian authorities over Nemtsov's shooting yards from the Kremlin.

Putin is said by his spokesman Dmitry Peskov to be 'exhaustively' working on documents but has - most unusually - not been seen publicly since 5 March, more than a week.

Miss Kabayeva performs her routines during two events in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2000 (left) and 1999 (right). The former gymnast is rumoured to be the president's girlfriend

The Kremlin insists he is healthy, but this has done nothing to end speculation from Russians who for years were lied to over the health of geriatric Soviet leaders, and also Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin.

'Peskov's assertion that Putin is in good health, however, could also mean recent developments in Russian politics required Putin's presence in Moscow,' stated The Moscow Times today.

In the middle of a wood, in the dark of night, they stood with their phones, taking photos and live-streaming the discovery of a triangular, humanoid statue. One Periscope of the journey and discovery had a total of over 29,000 viewers.



Some even dared to shake the statue’s hand.

The Gravity Falls fandom has taken on a life of its own. The Disney XD cartoon ran for only two seasons, but since its completion in February, has seen an uptick in popularity that hasn’t gone unnoticed by creator Alex Hirsch, who wanted to reward the fans with something befitting the show’s creepy, mysterious tone.

“I wanted to reward the fans who are still celebrating the show,” Hirsch told io9 by phone Wednesday. “I have a unique opportunity [so I presented this] final gift, a parting mystery.”

Hence the creation of the Cipher Hunt: a global scavenger hunt for fans. The mission was to find a statue of Bill Cipher, the cartoon’s main antagonist, by following clues posted by Hirsch on Twitter. If you’re new to the Gravity Falls fandom, you can read more on the basics of the social media scavenger hunt, which brought fans together over Twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit to solve the mystery, crack the clues, and find Cipher. It was an incredible feat that spanned continents, with some clues showing up in Russia, Japan, and in Los Angeles. You can check out this Reddit megathread, which documents the entire journey.

So for two weeks, people traveled all over, cracking codes and solving puzzles. After multiple clues, the final one: a tear in the original parchment that was cut in the outline of the woods in Reedsport, according to Google Maps.

Those that descended on the statue during its first night were not only met with a real-life incarnation of Bill Cipher, but also a box of treasure. Inside was some fake money, a smaller statue of Bill, a picture of the Pines family, and a USB that included an audio message from one of the show’s characters. Also inside were some messages from Hirsch that you could only read under a black light, which was provided.

Also inside was a crown and sash to be worn by the next mayor of Gravity Falls. A girl, who was the first one to find it, is now “canonically the mayor of Gravity Falls,” according to Hirsch.

At one point, a baby shook Bill’s hand, which in the show is basically the equivalent of making a deal with the devil.

Hirsch wouldn’t detail how long the hunt took to plan, but said that he installed the statue eight months ago in Reedsport, making a deal with a man who had an excluded spot in the show’s locale. So the statue seen in the final shots of the finale was indeed the real one. There was speculation immediately following the series ending that it could be real, and it just so happened the fans were correct.

The popularity of the event was surprising even to Hirsch. He thought after the finale the size of the fandom would stagnate, but the opposite happened. “The community has swelled in size,” Hirsch said.

The hunt coincided with the release of Gravity Falls: Journal #3, a tie-in book that hit bookstore shelves last week. Since then, it’s been sold out on Amazon and has reached number one on the New York Times Bestseller’s List in the “Middle Grade Hardcover” division, something else to hit home just how his show resonated with viewers. The combination of code breaking and interactivity online only added to the show’s complex characters and charming Pacific Northwest setting.

“There’s something about the interactivity of the show in the age of Twitter and Tumblr that makes people feel like they’re part of the story,” Hirsch said, speculating about why the show is so popular. “In some cases, I’m a character too. The show has taken on a life outside of television.”

The hunt wouldn’t have been nearly as popular without the internet. In the wake of other real-world experiences such a Pokémon Go, it’s brought people together outside of computer monitors and television screens. Hirsch equated the frenzy to being “camp counselor for 300,000 kids at once.” It’s a lot of fun and rewarding, but crazy.

“The internet is a collective mind and together they’re smarter than any one person,” he said.

The statue would’ve remained in its forever home if not for a small spat between two Oregon properties, however. Hirsch said that he made a deal with the man whose property housed Cipher, but a dispute between him and a neighbor over where the borders of the land were located caused Cipher to be “arrested” by police.

According to Hirsch, the entire incident was a “dumb miscommunication” that the local police took in stride, even offering to help install it somewhere else.

“[The police officer] was quite impressed by the amazing lengths of this hunt and how Alex had chosen Reedsport for the final place. He happily said that he would try his best to keep it safe and get it back into a public place if possible,” said Twitter user Sunbeam Pines, who was at the scene when the statue got removed.



So people who want to make the pilgrimage to Oregon will have to wait until Hirsch finds a new spot for it. No word on where it will be yet, or if there will be a secondary scavenger hunt—Hirsch is busy with other undisclosed projects, as much as he would like to make another one—but it definitely will have a new home.

As for whether Hirsch will do something like this again in the future, it depends on his schedule. What was most touching for him—and something that he gushed about over the phone multiple times—was the fun people were having over the hunt. People solved obtuse, ridiculous clues and broke clues and connected with people in other countries just to find a statue.

In an email to io9, Sunbeam wanted to thank Hirsch for the effort he put into the event and to the fans for the event itself.

“I had followed it the entire way through, waiting for a moment for us to be able to take action. Well, we had our moment. We found the statue and helped save Bill Cipher! Not only that, we helped make Gravity Falls history. But, it couldn’t have been done without the entire fandom. They supported us through streams and helped actually find the statue’s location. I’m really honored to have a part in the #CipherHunt and I hope to help Gravity Falls live on! This experience won’t be one that I’ll forget, and I am so thankful to Alex Hirsch for making it!”

The internet is a strange and wonderful place.

“The pointlessness of it inspires the passion,” he added. “I’d rather live in a world where there are treasure hunts to find a statue in the woods than one where everyone thinks something like that is too difficult.”",6937

OTTAWA -- A gunman turned the nation's capital into an armed camp Wednesday after he fatally shot an honour guard at ""point-blank"" range at the National War Memorial before setting his sights on Parliament Hill.

The extraordinary scene ended with the assailant shot dead in the polished marble halls of Parliament's Centre Block, apparently by the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, while SWAT teams combed the busy parliamentary precinct in an ultimately fruitless search for accomplices.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper capped the day's stunning events with a rare live televised address, calling the tragedy a terrorist attack that he said would only redouble Canada's efforts to combat fight terrorism at home and abroad.

Slain reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton, Ont., is the second member of the Armed Forces this week to die in an apparently random, murderous attack, just as Canadian war planes are being deployed to Iraq.

Two Canadian soldiers were run over -- one of them fatally -- in Quebec on Monday by a man with jihadist sympathies.

The slain shooter was identified as Michael Zehaf Bibeau, born in 1982 and known to police in Montreal and Vancouver.

""It's way too early to be able to determine a motive,"" Gilles Michaud, the assistant commissioner of the RCMP, said at a news conference in Ottawa while police were still clearing downtown buildings.

But the prime minister, who was in the Centre Block addressing a Conservative caucus meeting when the attack began just outside the door, later took to the national airwaves to unequivocally characterize the shooter's true motives.

""Fellow Canadians, in the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,"" Harper said.

""But this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.""

Attacks on Canadian security personnel and governing institutions, he said, are ""by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.""

Tony Zobl, 35, witnessed Cirillo being gunned down at the War Memorial from his fourth-floor office window directly above the monument, just before 10 a.m. Wednesday.

""I looked out the window and saw a shooter -- a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well -- holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph, point blank, twice,"" Zobl told The Canadian Press.

""It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun,"" he continued. ""The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.""

Zobl said the shooter then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.

It was only earlier this year that the government extended the season for live guards at the monument through the November Remembrance Day ceremonies. In the past, the honour guard has stood down after Labour Day.

The scene on Parliament Hill was frantic.

Wednesday morning is the busiest day of the week on the Hill, with MPs and senators of all major parties gathering in the Centre Block for meetings.

Given the time and day, it was remarkable only four persons were admitted to hospital. One was Cirillo, and the other three were all released Wednesday evening. Only one had a minor gunshot wound.

Witnesses and video suggest a hail of gunfire erupted in the marbled Hall of Honour that bisects the building directly beneath the Peace Tower.

Kevin Vickers, better known to political wonks as the ceremonially garbed sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace to open the Commons each day, was reported by multiple sources as the person who shot the gunman.

Construction worker Scott Walsh said he was in a manhole near the East Block building, between the memorial and the Centre Block, when he heard two gunshots echo down the street.

In the ensuing panic, people around him started screaming, including a woman pushing a child in a stroller.

He said she started to run, so he went to help her.

That's when he saw a man with long black hair, his face covered by a white scarf with decals on it and wearing a black jacket.

""He had a double-barrelled shotgun, he was about five feet from me, and he ran right beside us, ran past the woman with the stroller and child,"" he said.

The gunman then hijacked a car at gunpoint, he said, and drove it up towards the Peace Tower.

Greta Levy, a press secretary for the NDP, said she had just left the building when she saw the gunman walk up the paved ramp under the tower.

""None of us reacted at first but then we heard a security guard yelling, 'There's a gun, get down, get down, there's a gun,""' Levy said.

""And I looked up, as did the woman I was with, and saw a man that I would describe as young, 20s-30s, coming up the ramp as though to go in the main doors of Centre Block under the Peace Tower.""

The incident paralyzed the entire downtown core for hours, from the adjacent U.S. embassy to the University of Ottawa several city blocks to the south.

Sources say police at one point worried there could be up to five assailants, and they combed rooftops of nearby buildings in addition to the full lockdown.

The incident shattered the sleepy tenor of a capital that has been remarkably immune from attack through more than a decade of tumultuous overseas wars.

""I feared this day would come, and my prayers are with the fallen soldier,"" senior cabinet minister Tony Clement posted on Twitter while locked in the caucus room. ""Hug your fam.""

""It's a stomach-turning, shocking day for all Canadians,"" Marc Garneau, a former Forces member and now Liberal foreign affairs critic, said in an interview.

The Hill is known as an open public space that's used for everything from mass yoga classes to hazy pot-legalization demonstrations.

""I think the intention was to try to make Parliament not look like Fort Knox,"" said Garneau. ""But we've crossed a river today.""

Green party Leader Elizabeth May urged restraint.

""Today is not a day that 'changes everything,""' May said in a statement. ""It is a day of tragedy. We must ensure we keep our responses proportionate to whatever threat remains.""

Military bases have been put on alert and soldiers have been cautioned about wearing uniforms in public.

In Toronto, the country's largest city, extra police where put on the streets and public buildings were on alert.

Jan Lugtenborg, a tourist from the Netherlands, was at the War Memorial and able to describe the shooter in detail.

""We heard four shots,"" said Lugtenborg.

""You don't expect that when you're on holiday in Canada.""

Canada's prime minister called the incident the country's second terrorist attack in three days.

""This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere,"" Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a national address Wednesday evening.

""We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated,"" Harper added.

Law enforcement and U.S. government sources told CBS News the suspect's birth name was Michael Joseph Hall, born in Quebec in 1982. He recently converted to Islam and called himself Michael Abdul Zehaf-Bibeau. Sources said he had a history of drug addiction prior to his conversion.

Zehaf-Bibeau was reportedly shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, a former police officer. The gunman's motives have not been determined.

""In the days to come we will learn about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had,"" Harper said.

Canada was already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run assault Monday against two Canadian soldiers by a man Harper described as an ""ISIL-inspired terrorist,"" referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS.

The series of incidents in Ottawa began shortly before 10 a.m., when the soldier was shot. The victim, identified to CBS News by a cousin as 24-year-old Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, was later pronounced dead from his wounds.

Witnesses said Cirillo was gunned down by a man dressed all in black with a scarf over his face.

""I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,"" Tony Zobl, 35, told the Canadian Press news agency.

Zobl said he witnessed the incident from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

""The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle,"" Zobl said.

Zobl and other witnesses said the gunman then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill, and later entered the main building there, where dozens of shots rang out.

A reporter for the Globe and Mail captured much of that shooting incident in a video (which can be viewed at left.) Law enforcement officials can be seen cautiously proceeding with guns drawn down a main hallway, before a single loud shot rings out. A few seconds later, a hail of gunfire erupts.

People fled Parliament by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and blocked the normally bustling streets around the building.

Police gave no details on how the gunman died. But on Twitter, Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms.

Ottawa Hospital said in addition to Cirillo it received three patients, all with what were described as ""minor, non-life threatening injuries.""

""Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with ""origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.""

In Washington, President Obama condemned the shootings as ""outrageous acts,"" and in a telephone call with the prime minister, offered U.S. help and reassurance of the American people's solidarity with Canada.

''We're all shaken by it,"" Mr. Obama said, adding that as more becomes known about the shooter's motive, that information will be factored into U.S. security considerations.

""We have to remain vigilant,"" he said.

The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington. The NYPD also increased security at the Consulate General of Canada.

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings.

""I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security,"" Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill.

""PM (Harper) was addressing caucus, then a huge boom, followed by rat-a-tat shots. We all scattered. It was clearly right outside our caucus door,"" Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement said, according to Reuters.

A spokesman for Harper said: ""While the prime minister stated that facts are still being gathered, he condemned this despicable attack.""

Canada had raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday because of ""an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations,"" said Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for the public safety minister.

The National Hockey League postponed Wednesday night's game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Senators because of the shootings in Ottawa.

The NHL said in a statement it ""wishes to express its sympathy and prayers to all affected by the tragic events in Ottawa.""

The game was scheduled at the Canadian Tire Centre in nearby Kanata.

The incident comes just two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over, one of them killed, in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.

That suspect, 25-year-old Martin Couture Rouleau, was shot by police, and later died.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman David Falls said Monday that the suspect ""was known to federal authorities"" and ""authorities were concerned that he had become radicalized.""

Nathan Cirillo, fatally shot at National War Memorial","A soldier was fatally shot at the National War Memorial Wednesday morning before a single, masked suspect was shot dead in Parliament. In the midst of the chaotic situation, authorities said they were seeking multiple shooters, but while police continued their search into the afternoon, they declined to say whether they believe the gunman acted alone.

“Let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a message to the country Wednesday evening.

“One shooting victim succumbed to injuries. He was a member of the Canadian Forces. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones,” Ottawa police said in a statement.

The soldier has been identified by the National Post as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist based out of Hamilton, Ontario.

“Today a member of Hamilton’s own Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was killed while performing the duties of a sentry at the National War Memorial,” Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina said in a statement.

Two others were injured in the attack, one of them a security guard at Parliament’s Centre Block. Both are in stable condition.

One male gunman has also been confirmed dead.

Sources told The Canadian Press that Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons and 29-year RCMP veteran, shot the gunman within Parliament.

CBS News said the gunman has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982, citing unnamed U.S. government sources.

The RCMP and Ottawa police have not made a statement on the gunman’s identity.

“This is an ongoing joint police operation and there is no one in custody at this time,” is how Ottawa police and the RCMP described their joint investigation.

At an afternoon press conference, police said they could not yet confirm if the gunman who shot the soldier is the same as the one who was killed in Parliament.

Gilles Michaud, RCMP assistant commissioner, called it a “dynamic, unfolding situation.”

Police have been tight-lipped with information, leaving politicians to be the first to break news Wednesday.

“Gunman at Parliament’s Centre Block has been shot and killed,” Conservative MP Bernard Trottier tweeted at 10:30 a.m. Tory MP Bob Zimmer also reported the same.

Police expanded their perimeter throughout Wednesday afternoon and have confirmed there were shootings in two areas, the National War Memorial and in Parliament. Police said there was no shooting at the Rideau Centre, as was reported earlier during the chaotic situation.

Around 1:40 p.m., a security alert warned that all buildings in the Parliamentary precinct were still on lockdown.

“This means stay in your office, with the doors locked and away from the windows. If your door does not lock, find a way to barricade the door, if possible,” read the alert, circulated by email. “Do not open the door under any circumstances. Security Services has the required keys.”

Police asked citizens to not tweet the locations of the officers involved as the RCMP describes the situation as “ongoing.”

Ottawa Civic hospital received two new patients at about noon, one with gunshot wounds and the other with unknown injuries. Both were reported to be in stable condition.

The hospital would not comment on the condition of the soldier.

In video taken within Parliament at about 10 a.m., about a dozen gunshots can be heard within the halls.

Witnesses reported hearing shots in different corridors of Parliament and some fled the building by using the scaffolding erected for renovations.

Several medics and bystanders performed CPR on the soldier before he was taken away by ambulance.

“There is a shooter on the loose,” a police officer in the area told the Post‘s John Ivison shortly after 10 a.m.

The PMO said earlier Wednesday that Prime Minister Stephen Harper was safe and left Parliament Hill for an unknown location. Both NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau were reported safe.

One suspect was described as “5’9-5’10, overweight and wearing a dark jacket, with a white scarf around his face,” by Stuart Barnable, a Liberal staffer who said he witnessed the events from East Block.

Another eyewitness described the gunman as: “young, 30ish, Caucasian and male.”

A Dutch tourist said he heard at least four shots and saw the assailant running towards Parliament Hill, carrying a large rifle.

A Toyota Corolla, with no plates on it, was left outside of Parliament Hill. Multiple witnesses said they saw a gunman get out of it and attack the soldier. Bomb locating robots were deployed by police near the car.

U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron offered his “full support” to Prime Minister Harper.

“I’m appalled by today’s attack in Ottawa,” he wrote on Twitter.

Reports of at least one active shooter sparked chaos in Canada’s Parliament as MPs — and the Prime Minister — met just steps away from where a gunman opened fire.

Reporters and staffers grabbing breakfast and coffee were ushered in to the fifth floor cafeteria as security confirmed that there was an active shooter on the 2nd floor.

Huddled into a corner, with some staffers chanting prayers and others trying to laugh off the fear, two dozen Parliament Hill workers rapidly checked Twitter as reports circulated that one or two gunmen may still be on the loose.

Many reporters had been in the Hall of Honour — not far from where the gunman later opened fire — when the first shooting occurred. Parliament Hill then went on lockdown.

For the staffers huddled there, it was impossible to know the situation. Reports circulated of active shooters as cooks, unarmed security and an assortment of others huddled under counters.

A Liberal party staffer locked in an office on Parliament Hill said Justin Trudeau was in Centre Block for a 10 a.m. caucus meeting when shots broke out.

“I don’t know where he is, but I’m told he’s in a secure location,” the staffer said around 11 a.m.

Trudeau’s office put out a statement later Wednesday.

“All Canadians are particularly shocked and saddened by the horrific shooting of a young man, as he dutifully guarded our National War Memorial,” the statement read.

“Canadians are a resilient people who treasure our freedom. We cannot and will not allow armed criminals to terrorize our country and our democracy. Mr. Trudeau spoke with the Prime Minister earlier this afternoon and offered the Liberal Party of Canada’s absolute support as we seek to prosecute those responsible for this attack, and prevent events like it from happening in the future.”

All Ottawa police stations were closed as a result of the shooting. Military bases throughout Canada have also been placed under lockdown.

Nathan Cirillo, fatally shot at National War Memorial","A soldier was fatally shot at the National War Memorial Wednesday morning before a single, masked suspect was shot dead in Parliament. In the midst of the chaotic situation, authorities said they were seeking multiple shooters, but while police continued their search into the afternoon, they declined to say whether they believe the gunman acted alone.

“Let there be no misunderstanding. We will not be intimidated,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a message to the country Wednesday evening.

“One shooting victim succumbed to injuries. He was a member of the Canadian Forces. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones,” Ottawa police said in a statement.

The soldier has been identified by the National Post as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist based out of Hamilton, Ontario.

“Today a member of Hamilton’s own Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was killed while performing the duties of a sentry at the National War Memorial,” Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina said in a statement.

Two others were injured in the attack, one of them a security guard at Parliament’s Centre Block. Both are in stable condition.

One male gunman has also been confirmed dead.

Sources told The Canadian Press that Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons and 29-year RCMP veteran, shot the gunman within Parliament.

CBS News said the gunman has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian born in 1982, citing unnamed U.S. government sources.

The RCMP and Ottawa police have not made a statement on the gunman’s identity.

“This is an ongoing joint police operation and there is no one in custody at this time,” is how Ottawa police and the RCMP described their joint investigation.

At an afternoon press conference, police said they could not yet confirm if the gunman who shot the soldier is the same as the one who was killed in Parliament.

Gilles Michaud, RCMP assistant commissioner, called it a “dynamic, unfolding situation.”

Police have been tight-lipped with information, leaving politicians to be the first to break news Wednesday.

“Gunman at Parliament’s Centre Block has been shot and killed,” Conservative MP Bernard Trottier tweeted at 10:30 a.m. Tory MP Bob Zimmer also reported the same.

Police expanded their perimeter throughout Wednesday afternoon and have confirmed there were shootings in two areas, the National War Memorial and in Parliament. Police said there was no shooting at the Rideau Centre, as was reported earlier during the chaotic situation.

Around 1:40 p.m., a security alert warned that all buildings in the Parliamentary precinct were still on lockdown.

“This means stay in your office, with the doors locked and away from the windows. If your door does not lock, find a way to barricade the door, if possible,” read the alert, circulated by email. “Do not open the door under any circumstances. Security Services has the required keys.”

Police asked citizens to not tweet the locations of the officers involved as the RCMP describes the situation as “ongoing.”

Ottawa Civic hospital received two new patients at about noon, one with gunshot wounds and the other with unknown injuries. Both were reported to be in stable condition.

The hospital would not comment on the condition of the soldier.

In video taken within Parliament at about 10 a.m., about a dozen gunshots can be heard within the halls.

Witnesses reported hearing shots in different corridors of Parliament and some fled the building by using the scaffolding erected for renovations.

Several medics and bystanders performed CPR on the soldier before he was taken away by ambulance.

“There is a shooter on the loose,” a police officer in the area told the Post‘s John Ivison shortly after 10 a.m.

The PMO said earlier Wednesday that Prime Minister Stephen Harper was safe and left Parliament Hill for an unknown location. Both NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau were reported safe.

One suspect was described as “5’9-5’10, overweight and wearing a dark jacket, with a white scarf around his face,” by Stuart Barnable, a Liberal staffer who said he witnessed the events from East Block.

Another eyewitness described the gunman as: “young, 30ish, Caucasian and male.”

A Dutch tourist said he heard at least four shots and saw the assailant running towards Parliament Hill, carrying a large rifle.

A Toyota Corolla, with no plates on it, was left outside of Parliament Hill. Multiple witnesses said they saw a gunman get out of it and attack the soldier. Bomb locating robots were deployed by police near the car.

U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron offered his “full support” to Prime Minister Harper.

“I’m appalled by today’s attack in Ottawa,” he wrote on Twitter.

Reports of at least one active shooter sparked chaos in Canada’s Parliament as MPs — and the Prime Minister — met just steps away from where a gunman opened fire.

Reporters and staffers grabbing breakfast and coffee were ushered in to the fifth floor cafeteria as security confirmed that there was an active shooter on the 2nd floor.

Huddled into a corner, with some staffers chanting prayers and others trying to laugh off the fear, two dozen Parliament Hill workers rapidly checked Twitter as reports circulated that one or two gunmen may still be on the loose.

Many reporters had been in the Hall of Honour — not far from where the gunman later opened fire — when the first shooting occurred. Parliament Hill then went on lockdown.

For the staffers huddled there, it was impossible to know the situation. Reports circulated of active shooters as cooks, unarmed security and an assortment of others huddled under counters.

A Liberal party staffer locked in an office on Parliament Hill said Justin Trudeau was in Centre Block for a 10 a.m. caucus meeting when shots broke out.

“I don’t know where he is, but I’m told he’s in a secure location,” the staffer said around 11 a.m.

Trudeau’s office put out a statement later Wednesday.

495305620342714369,true,"Tesla says it's broken ground near Reno, Nevada for a $5 billion battery plant: http://t.co/p5tgFSzLvX http://t.co/NdYRVLviza",http://bloom.bg/1pJF4XL,True,Tesla Breaks Ground as Nevada Takes Lead for New Factory,"Tesla Motors Inc. said it’s broken ground near Reno for a $5 billion battery plant, signaling Nevada has vaulted to the lead of five states vying for the so-called gigafactory and its promise of 6,500 jobs.

The electric-car maker said it’s still reviewing sites in California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, each of which is competing to snare the economic development plum, described as the single biggest new industrial project in the U.S.

“On the Nevada side, the ball is in the court of the governor and the state legislature,” Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said yesterday in a conference call.

For Nevada, with a 7.7 percent unemployment rate that’s the third-highest in the U.S., Tesla represents an opportunity to show that its economy can diversify beyond gambling and housing. The stakes are high for the other states as well. Putting the plant in California would help shake a reputation for high costs and tough regulations that stifle business. For Texas, where Governor Rick Perry is eyeing a comeback presidential bid, the plant could boost prospects on the national stage.

Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, said it needs the sprawling factory in operation by 2017 to supply lower-cost lithium-ion cells for its cars and packs for home-power storage devices.

“We’ve essentially completed the creating of the construction pad for the gigafactory in Nevada,” Musk said. “We are going to be doing something similar in one or two other states.” Musk has said Tesla might start work on as many as three potential sites and decide by year-end which to build to completion, based on the speed of regulatory approval.

State Incentives

The billionaire entrepreneur said he expects the state selected for the plant to provide about 10 percent of the factory’s cost. That suggests Tesla is looking for incentives of $400 million to $500 million for the project.

“Before we actually go to the next stage of pouring a lot of concrete, we want to make sure we have things sorted out at the state level -- the incentives are there that make sense and are fair to the state and Tesla,” Musk said. “We want to make sure it’s compelling for all parties.”

Jennifer Cooper, a spokeswoman for Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval’s Office of Economic Development, said conversations with Tesla remain confidential.

The Nevada site is in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center in McCarran, nine miles east of Reno. The center, which covers 107,000 acres, has 30,000 developable acres pre-approved for industrial and manufacturing uses, according to its website.

‘Most Attractive’

Given the scale of the investment required for the battery plant, “this would rank as the most attractive industrial project out there,” Dennis Cuneo, president of DC Strategic Advisors LLC and a former Toyota executive who helped that carmaker select manufacturing sites, said in an interview earlier this year.

Jonathan Gemmen, a senior location consultant with Austin Consulting, a site-selection firm based in Cleveland, said Tesla’s gigafactory is the most-watched project in his industry, if only for the media attention it’s drawn.

“There’s a real panache and marketing piece because the technology itself is so interesting,” Gemmen said of Tesla’s electric cars. “Louisiana has announced a bunch of chemical projects this year that the mainstream media doesn’t care about. From a marketing perspective, this is the hottest thing going on.”

California, which has lost manufacturing jobs to states with lower taxes and less regulation, was initially ruled out by Musk in February. He cited the time needed for the state’s stringent environmental review. In May, Musk said California was back on the list.

California-Born

“Tesla was born in California and currently employs over 6,000 people, making them the largest automotive company in the state,” Brook Taylor, a spokesman from the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, said in a statement. “The administration is working every day to help companies expand in California and Tesla is certainly one of those companies.”

Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill in July that grants a tax incentive to companies making certain types of batteries eligible for a tax credit. State lawmakers also have promised to push for regulatory changes that would make it easier for Tesla to build the factory there.

California, home to more companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index than any other state, has seen dozens of employers depart for places such as Texas. That, executives say, points to California’s highest-in-the-nation income and sales tax rates, plus a cost of living that is sixth highest in the country, according to the Missouri Department of Economic Development.

Apple, Toyota

In 2012, Apple Inc. chose Texas to build a new operations hub after the Lone Star State offered $21 million in tax incentives. Toyota Motor Corp. in April said it was moving 2,000 California jobs to a new North American headquarters outside Dallas. While the carmaker said it made the move to be closer to southern manufacturing facilities, Texas offered the company $40 million in incentives.

Perry appeared in Sacramento in June driving a Tesla, telling reporters he wished it had a “made in Texas” bumper sticker.

Texas, while farther from Tesla’s California headquarters, can pitch its lower costs of living and doing business, as well as looser regulations, said Bernard Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute in the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

“We’ve had a lot of companies expand and move to Texas at the expense of California,” Weinstein said. “They’ve lost so many businesses to Texas that they will do anything needed to bring that plant to California.”

High Unemployment

Nevada’s unemployment rate peaked at 13.9 percent in August 2010 and remained higher than all but Rhode Island and Mississippi in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state has courted cleaner manufacturers through incentives such as sales and use tax reductions to companies that use solar, wind, biomass, fuel cell, geothermal and hydro power sources.

Economic development authorities, buoyed by Apple’s decision to build a solar-powered data center in Reno last year, are trying to lure Tesla with promises of abundant sunshine and other renewable energy sources, comparatively lax environmental rules and a workforce trained in robotics, Mike Kazmierski, president of the Reno-based Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada, said by telephone.

“The most important reason is that the cost of doing business in Nevada, and northern Nevada specifically, is about 30 percent to 40 percent less than in California,” Kazmierski said. “Manufacturing is a big part of our economy and continues to get bigger.”",6828
775672628493357057,unverified,Clinton Hides Failing Health? Full Disclosure Now:  Covert Doctors and Nurses https://t.co/s05sw7eK8a via @MailOnline #MAGA @realDonaldTrump,http://dailym.ai/2cAoqQj,True,Hillary Clinton's nurse appears to check pulse before her collapse at 9/11 memorial,"Hillary Clinton is facing new questions over whether she brought her personal doctor, Lisa Bardack, to the 9/11 memorial where she collapsed.

The Democratic candidate had a woman at her side throughout her time there - and as she was escorted away, the woman appeared to check Clinton's pulse.

She also held Clinton's hand in a way which it has been suggested may have been some sort of neurological test.

The woman was also seen whispering in Clinton's ear in a video taken of VIPs at the commemoration.

A series of Twitter users have questioned whether it is Dr Lisa Bardack, the physician who diagnosed her with pneumonia.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Taking her pulse? Questions have been raised over whether the woman seen here on NBC footage of Clinton at the memorial was checking her vital signs and therefore medically trained

Holding her hand: A photograph of the immediate seconds after Clinton left the front row of the memorial shows the woman holding the candidate's hand

Diagnosis: Dr Lisa Bardack, who confirmed on Sunday that Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia Friday. It has been suggested that she was at Clinton's side at the memorial

Present throughout: The woman was with Clinton as she arrived for Sunday's 9/11 commemoration ceremony. Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but kept it secret

Close to the candidate: As Clinton made her way through the crowd, the woman was close by

Clinton-whisperer: As names beginning with the letter B were read out at the ceremony, the woman whispered at length in Clinton's ear

Front-row place: Clinton was beside New York senator Chuck Schumer (left) and in the same row as (from right) Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor; Donald Trump, her presidential rival, Rudolph Giliuani, New York mayor during 9/11; Bill de Blasio, the city's current mayor; and Michael Bloomberg, the mayor in between Giuliani and de Blasio

The presence of someone with medical training would raise concern that Clinton went to the event knowing her health was at risk.

She is already facing criticism for keeping her diagnosis with pneumonia two days earlier secret - and for her campaign taking hours to admit the truth.

The campaign's changing story on Sunday saw aides claim first that she was 'overheated' and then that she was suffering because of heat and humidity - on a day in New York which other people thought was a pleasant late summer morning.

Finally, at 5pm on Sunday, there was an admission that she had pneumonia, which the campaign said had been diagnosed by Dr Bardack.

CLINTON'S DOCTOR Lisa Bardack has been Hillary Clinton's 'long time' personal physician. Exactly how long is unknown, as the candidate has not published her full medical records. Dr Bardack, 52, works for CareMount Medical, a network of 400 physicians in New York State, where the Clinton have their home. A New York University medical graduate, she is the group's chair of internal medicine and usually works at its Mount Kisco campus, close to Chappaqua.

Dr Bardack has been suggested to be to be the woman who was at Clinton's side as she was escorted away from the memorial.

The campaign has not commented on whether she is. DailyMail.com is also trying to contact Dr Bardack.

The dark-haired woman was accompanied by a Secret Service agent who is part of Clinton's regular security detail as she helped Clinton away from the memorial, and towards the van waiting for her.

On the way there, she held Clinton's hand in a gesture which has been suggested to be either taking her pulse, or a test for neurological damage.

The neurological test is one of a series administered to check that the brain is correctly instructing the body and has not suffered damage in some form.

The woman is not one of Clinton's well-known aides often seen at her side, including Huma Abedin, her closest assistant, and is not known to have been seen with Clinton before.

The woman appears to have stood directly behind Clinton and whispered at length in her ear, video footage of the memorial service itself also discloses.

Twitter is alight with rumors that someone is keeping tabs on Clinton's health at all times, and that the candidate may even be suffering neurological damage.

Supporting role: As Clinton collapsed getting into the Secret Service 'Scooby van', the woman was to her left holding her

Escort: The woman was directly beside Clinton as she was led away from the memorial, to the surprise of other people there

'Undercover': This photo appears to show a woman, described as an 'undercover nurse' checking Clinton's pulse prior to her collapse on Sunday, while Clinton clutches her heart

Rumors: Pictures apparently showing Clinton squeezing the woman's fingers also revived much derided rumors that Clinton is suffering from Parkinson's disease

Doctor who? Some Twitter users suggested the mystery woman was Clinton's doctor, Lisa Bardack, although this could not be confirmed.

Clinton collapsed outside her van during Sunday's 9/11 memorial service in New York and was rushed to her daughter's apartment.

Although the collapse was initially written off as 'overheating' by the Clinton camp, Dr Bardack, later confirmed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.

But photographs of Clinton being walked to the SUV appear to show her being tended to by a woman in a blue dress, whom many believe is a nurse.

A Twitter account titled 'Tennessee GOP' posted a picture of Clinton with her right hand on her heart and her left hand and wrist clasped by the woman.

'Undercover nurse checking Hillary's pulse?!' the tweet asked.

And a second picture, posted by Mathijs Koenraadt showed Clinton talking to the woman, apparently holding her fingers.

'#Hillary squeezing her nurse's fingers,' the user wrote. 'Clearly, she's disoriented. Final stages of Parkinson's disease?'

The woman in question was identified by some as Dr Bardack, but she could not be contacted for comment, and does not appear certain to be the woman.

The sentiments in both Tweets were echoed by numerous other users, under the hashtags #HillaryHealth and #ClintonCollapse.

Claims that Clinton has been suffering from Parkinson's disease have long circulated, although they have never been taken seriously outside of conspiracy theory groups.

Similar concerns also emerged about the presidential candidate having suffered brain or neurological damage as a result of her 2012 diagnoses of a blood clot in her brain, which came after she collapsed due to dehydration and suffered concussion.

She had also suffered two previous blood clots, in 1998 and 2009, as well as suffering a fractured elbow in 2009 after suffering a fall.

Clinton also collapsed in January 2005, reportedly due to a GI virus.",6756

767355933919997952,non-rumor,"Suicide bomber who killed at least 50 in Turkey was aged 12-14, state-run news agency quotes president as saying. https://t.co/NYwhawfcpE",http://cnn.it/2b9HdfA,True,"Turkish wedding suicide bomber was 12-14 years old, Erdogan says","Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) Hakki Okur's family was searching hospitals for him Sunday morning after an explosion at a Kurdish wedding in Turkey killed at least 53 people.

The 14-year-old boy's sister had last seen him running away after a small explosion at 11 p.m. Saturday, said his cousin Mesut Bozkurt. Suddenly, a larger explosion knocked the sister to the ground. She awoke in a hospital. She remembered last seeing her brother alive.

""We looked for Hakki in hospitals and police station all night long,"" Bozkurt said. ""At 5.30 we were called to identify his body. No injuries on his head but burns on his chest. We think he may have been trapped in the panic, since he was a skinny boy.""

The family learned later Sunday morning that Hakki's killer was between age 12 and 14.

At least 22 victims were under the age of 14, according to a Turkish official.

Emine Ayhan told Turkish television the bombing seriously injured her husband and killed four of her five children. ""If my remaining child was not alive, I would commit suicide,"" she said.

Authorities found a suicide vest at the scene, although it is unclear whether the boy bomber blew himself up or it was detonated remotely, the bomber's age apparently giving authorities pause at assigning him blame.

The age and the number of victims was the salient information Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered Sunday, according to Turkish media.

The attack hit an outdoor wedding celebration in a conservative Kurdish neighborhood in the city of Gaziantep, near the Syrian border. In a year of bloody terrorist attacks in Turkey, the wedding bombing ranks among the worst, the death toll surpassing the attack on the Ataturk Airport, which killed 44

Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, the Turkish President said the terror group ISIS was the prime suspect behind the attack.

""The initial findings of the governor and our police forces indicate the attack has been perpetrated by Daesh,"" said Erdogan, using another term for the terror group. ""As you know, Daesh is trying to position and organize itself in Gaziantep. Security operations have been conducted and are still being conducted against the terrorist organization.""

Kurdish militants, who for decades have conducted attacks against the Turkish government in their quest for independence, have become key American allies in the battle against ISIS.

People gather at the scene of an explosion in Gaziantep.

By late Sunday afternoon, at least 43 of the victims had been buried, following Islamic tradition. Sixty-nine people were wounded in the blast, with 17 of them in critical condition, reported Anadolu Agency, Turkish state-run media.

The bride and groom were among the injured, although their condition was not critical, Anadolu reported, citing hospital officials.

The White House and the State Department quickly condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with Turkey and the victims. ""The perpetrators of this barbaric act cynically and cowardly targeted a wedding, said Ned Price, spokesman for the National Security Council.

Officials have found pieces of a detonated suicide vest at the scene, the agency reported. Witnesses to the blast described horrific scenes to Anadolu, with one telling the agency that body parts were strewn across the bomb site.

""We couldn't see anything. Nothing but body parts,"" Sukru Akdogan, the groom's brother, told Anadolu.

Kurdish celebration targeted

The blast occurred in the Beybahce neighborhood of Gaziantep's Sahinbey district about 10:50 p.m. Saturday, according to the Gaziantep governor's office. Gaziantep is about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo.

The target was a crowded street in a Kurdish neighborhood where the Kurdish wedding party was taking place, according to Turkey-based journalist Andrew Finkel.

He said there were a number of reasons the Sunni terror group -- if it is responsible for the attack -- could have been motivated to strike Kurdish targets.

Kurdish militia have played a central role in recent battlefield victories against ISIS in northern Syria, including driving the group from the key city of Manbij earlier this month and cutting a key supply route from the Turkish border to its heartland in Raqqa.

""This may very well be a revenge attack for that,"" Finkel said.

CNN Map

The blast may also have been an attempt to inflame ethnic tensions in the city, home to many refugees from the Syrian conflict, he said.

ISIS operatives have previously struck in the bustling southern Turkish city of about 1.5 million people, with the group claiming responsibility for the shootings of anti-ISIS activists in Gaziantep in December and April

Turkey, which allows planes from the US-led anti-ISIS coalition to operate from its air base at Incirlik, has been in ISIS' crosshairs, with the group blamed for a series of bomb attacks in the country throughout the year.

Erdogan: 'No difference' between Turkey's enemies

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the Gaziantep blast.

But in a statement condemning the attack, Erdogan identified ISIS as the likely perpetrator.

The statement reiterated Erdogan's position, expressed after three bombings targeting security forces in eastern Turkey last week, that there was ""no difference"" between the three main opponents of his government -- namely the terror group ISIS; the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK; and the network of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen , state-run Anadolu news agency reported Sunday.

Erdogan accuses Gulen of being behind a failed coup attempt last month; Gulen has denied the accusation.

""Those who cannot overcome Turkey and try to provoke people by abusing ethnic and sectarian sensitiveness will not prevail,"" Anadolu quoted Erdogan as saying.

Ongoing turmoil

Even before the attempted July 15 coup, Turkey had experienced a year of bloodshed and political turmoil, weathering a string of deadly bomb blasts, blamed variously on ISIS and the PKK.

In the most recent attacks, 11 people were killed and hundreds injured in three bombings targeting security forces in eastern Turkey last week . The Turkish government blamed the PKK.

Clashes between the PKK and Turkish forces have flared up again since a peace process crumbled in 2015, bringing an end to a two-year ceasefire.

Since then, Anadolu reports, hundreds of Turkish security forces and about 5,000 PKK members have been killed in the conflict.",6685

Explorer Henry Worsley has died after developing a serious infection as he tried to cross Antarctica unaided.

The ex-Army officer, from London, had been rescued 30 miles shy of his goal.

His wife Joanna said she felt ""heartbroken sadness"" after he died of ""complete organ failure"".

Mr Worsley, 55, was trying to complete the unfinished journey of his hero, Sir Ernest Shackleton, 100 years later, but in his final audio message, he said: ""My summit is just out of reach.""

In that last broadcast, sent from Antarctica on Friday, he told supporters: ""When my hero, Ernest Shackleton, was 97 miles from the South Pole on the morning of January the 9th 1909, he said he'd shot his bolt.

""Well, today I have to inform you with some sadness that I too have shot my bolt.""

Mr Worsley said his journey had ended because he did not have the ability to ""slide one ski in front of the other"".

""I will lick my wounds, they will heal over time and I will come to terms with the disappointment,"" he added.

'Grinding down'

Prince William has led the tributes to Mr Worsley, who was raising money for the Endeavour Fund, a charity which helps wounded servicemen and women and is managed by the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The duke, who was patron of the expedition, said he and Prince Harry had lost a friend, as he paid tribute to Mr Worsley's ""selfless commitment"" to fellow soldiers.

""He was a man who showed great courage and determination and we are incredibly proud to be associated with him,"" he said.

The princes pledged to ensure Mr Worsley's family, which includes his two children, Max, 21, and Alicia, 19, received the support needed ""at this terribly difficult time"".

Mr Worsley was airlifted off the ice on Saturday, on day 71 and 913 miles (1,469km) into his trek.

Initially, it was thought he was dehydrated and malnourished. It was only discovered he was suffering from a serious infection - bacterial peritonitis - when he was treated at Union Glacier base camp.

He was then flown to a hospital in Punta Arenas, Chile, to undergo surgery but died on Sunday.

Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen. According to the NHS, most cases come from injury or infection in another part of the body.

On Instagram, David Beckham said he was ""lucky to have met Henry"", who had ""served our country for so many years"".

And adventurer Bear Grylls tweeted: ""We are devastated by this loss. One of the strongest men & bravest soldiers I know. Praying for his special family.""

Gen Sir Nick Carter - the head of the Army and a close friend of the explorer - said Mr Worsley had ""extraordinary traits of courage and determination"" but he did it all with the ""most extraordinary modesty and humility"".

Polar explorer Pen Hadow told the BBC that Mr Worsley, by going solo with no resupply, had embarked on the ""hardest form of travel quite possibly on the surface of the earth"".

He said his body would not have had enough time to replenish itself during the rest periods, which meant ""losing a small percentage of your capability every day"". But he said the ""single hardest challenge"" on such a journey was ""managing your mind-set"".

Image copyright PA Image caption The Duke of Cambridge said Henry Worsley showed ""great courage""

Mr Worsley began the coast-to-coast trek in November, pulling a sledge containing his food, tent and equipment.

The plan was to cross the continent ""unassisted and unsupported"" - with no supply drops or help from dogs or any other source.

The first solo and unsupported crossing of the continent was achieved by Norwegian Borge Ousland in 1997. But Mr Worsley's record attempt differed as Mr Ousland used a kite to help drag his supply sled.

British explorer Felicity Aston became the first woman to cross the Antarctic alone in January 2012 but she had supply drops.

Profile: Henry Worsley

Henry Worsley retired from the British army having attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in October 2015 after a 36-year career, serving with the Royal Green Jackets and later the Rifles.

His military career saw him awarded an MBE for distinguished service on operations in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.

Since childhood he had a passionate interest in the lives of the Antarctic explorers of the Edwardian era - Sir Ernest Shackleton, Captain Robert Scott and Roald Amundsen.

In 2008, Mr Worsley led an expedition to commemorate the centenary of Shackleton's ""Nimrod"" journey, which pioneered a route through the Transantarctic Mountains to a point just 97 miles (156km) short of the South Pole.

To commemorate the centenary of Scott's and Amundsen's expeditions, Mr Worsley returned to Antarctica in 2011, leading a team of six soldiers retracing the original 1912 journey to the South Pole.

He led the Amundsen route - a 900-mile (1,448km) unsupported journey - and in doing so, became the only person to have completed the classic Antarctic routes of Shackleton, Scott and Amundsen.

Source: Endeavour Fund

Mr Worsley's latest expedition again followed in the footsteps of his idol Sir Ernest Shackleton, who set off to cross Antarctica in 1914. The ill-fated trip saw his ship Endurance became trapped in ice for 10 months before it sank, but not one of the expedition's members died.

Mr Worsley was a distant relative of Frank Worsley, the captain of the Endurance.

Sir Ernest Shackleton's granddaughter Alexandra said Mr Worsley's death would be a ""huge loss to the adventuring world"".

""The whole point of this one was that Henry was doing it on his own. I suppose you could say he was doing more and more adventurous and interesting things,"" she said.

Mr Worsley had passed his target of raising £100,000, and the Endeavour Fund said in a statement that it was ""devastated"" by his death.

In October, he told the BBC he expected to lose two stone (12.7kg) during the challenge.

He said his journey should take 75 days and he would take enough food for 80 days.

Asked if he was ""mad"" to take on the challenge, he said: ""What will drive me on is raising money for these wounded soldiers.""",6622

The UK is to accept more unaccompanied child refugees from Syria and other conflict zones - but the government has not said how many.

The Home Office will work with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to identify ""exceptional cases"" from camps in Syria and neighbouring countries.

The UK is to take 20,000 refugees from Syria by 2020 - but campaigners want it to take 3,000 children from Europe.

The PM said doing so might spur more refugees to risk ""lethal"" journeys.

Save the Children said child refugees in Europe were ""incredibly vulnerable"".

The government also said it was giving £10m to help vulnerable refugee minors already in Europe; some can be brought to the UK ""where it is in their best interests"".

Campaigners welcomed the announcement on child refugees, but Labour warned about a ""false distinction between refugees in the region and refugees in Europe"". UKIP said £10m was a ""minuscule amount"".

What is the UK doing to help?

Migration to Europe in graphics

The UK has already accepted about 1,000 refugees from Syria under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Programme, which the government expanded last year.

But Prime Minister David Cameron has come under pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, as well as from within his own party, to do more.

He has faced calls to prioritise children who have been separated from their families as a result of the five-year war in Syria, conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and large-scale migration from Eritrea.

'Right approach'

Mr Cameron insisted the government's approach was ""compassionate"", and ""no country in Europe has done more than Britain to help with the Syrian refugee crisis"".

""I think it is right our approach to take refugees from the region, not encouraging them to make the difficult, potentially lethal, journey to Europe,"" he told Sky News.

He also rejected criticism of his description in the Commons of refugees in a Calais camp as a ""bunch of migrants"", saying he did not accept that his words were unpleasant.

""No, I was very clear what I meant yesterday, which was to say Labour have an open door migration policy,"" he said.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has urged the PM to apologise for his ""dismissive language and tone"" which he said ""demeans people's suffering"".

The Home Office has not put a figure on how many under-18s will be taken in as part of the joint initiative with the UNHCR, but it confirmed those accepted would be in addition to the existing 20,000 figure.

Sources have indicated the numbers involved would not significantly increase the current 20,000 commitment.

Analysis

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg

The prime minister has been under pressure - just as in the summer months when the full scale of the migrant crisis became clear - to make more effort to help the most vulnerable among the hundreds of thousands of people on the move.

In recent days that pressure has taken the shape of calls from the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and campaign groups like Save the Children, to open Britain's doors to 3,000 children, alone and potentially in danger on the migrant trail in Europe.

Just hours after the PM was accused of a ""disgraceful"" tone towards those in need - calling them a 'bunch of migrants' - the government has given a partial answer to its critics.

Home Office minister James Brokenshire said the government scheme would focus on displaced children in Syria and the Middle East - not those already in Europe.

He said the UNHCR would help to identify ""exceptional cases"" to be resettled in the UK but added that the ""vast majority"" were better off staying in the region.

Asked about child refugees in camps across Europe, he said: ""We are providing aid and support, millions of pounds to other European countries - to the western Balkans as well - to see that they get that help and support they need as early as possible.""

The government says some migrants in Europe could be allowed to come to Britain under the terms of the Dublin convention on asylum - if they already have family members living lawfully in the country.

Kirsty McNeil, from Save the Children, said there was ""confusion"" over exactly what the government was proposing.

""There does seem to be action in Italy and Greece to help the authorities identify more children who are already in Europe and get them to safety here in the UK,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

However, she said it appeared they would be eligible to come only if they had a ""family connection"".

She said more needed to be done to help child refugees in Europe, saying thousands ""simply disappeared"" from the Italian system last year ""into the hands of traffickers, or... the sex trade or the drugs trade"".

Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour's refugee taskforce, said the UK ""cannot turn our backs on children who are already in Europe and desperate families who have already come to Europe because they are fleeing persecution"".

David Simmonds, from the Local Government Association, said councils would need extra support to take care of more unaccompanied children.

The additional £10m to help vulnerable refugee and migrant children in Europe will come from the overseas aid budget and be channelled through NGOs and UN agencies.

It is aimed at helping children facing ""additional risks"", to provide ""safe places"" for them to stay, and support a database to trace children, as well as counselling and legal services.

The figure of 3,000 child refugees was originally proposed by Save The Children, which said it would represent a ""fair share"" for the UK of the estimated 26,000 children who arrived in Europe in 2015 without any family.",6587
693804630615166977,non-rumor,"Research on which matters more: ""leadership qualities"" or competence https://t.co/pv5irMkHbS https://t.co/CmsSMxgPbV",http://s.hbr.org/1SgNj12,True,“Leadership Qualities” vs. Competence: Which Matters More?,"There’s sometimes a disconnect between how we talk about leadership qualities (we tend to use words like authority, power, and emotional intelligence) and what we actually require from the people leading teams and other working groups (arguably, competence and a deep knowledge of the specific work that needs to get done). In a forthcoming Journal of Applied Psychology article, researchers from Stanford and Erasmus University explore which set of qualities matters most to team performance. The paper also looks at when power differences contribute to team success, and when they damage it.

I spoke with Stanford’s Lindred Greer about the research; an edited version of our conversation appears below. The other authors on the article are Murat Taraki (lead author) and Patrick Groenen, both at the Rotterdam School of Management.



HBR: What did you hope to learn from this research?

Greer: First, we wanted to understand when it’s ideal to have a strong hierarchy, and when it’s better to let groups manage themselves. People talk a lot about “holacracies” and self-management right now, but from a research point of view they’re largely untested.

Second, we were interested in investigating how good people actually are at recognizing good leadership. We teach our students about things like power poses – how to appear to be someone with authority – and how to fake it ‘til you make it. Those things are based on great research and they have real value, but are we losing sight of whether people actually have the goods? (David Dunning and Justin Kruger at Cornell have great research showing that the least competent people often end up in charge because they’re overconfident about their own abilities.)

In the first study, you simulated how well three different types of teams performed. The teams were searching collaboratively for the best solution to a complex problem. How’d they do?

In one group of teams, influence was aligned with competence: the person who knew the most about the task to be done led the team. These groups performed best.

A second group of teams shared power – they were relatively non-hierarchical. This group did not perform as well as the first, but they did outperform our third group of teams — hierarchical teams with a randomly chosen leader.

We replicated these findings in the field, by the way. We studied 49 teams at a publicly held Dutch company; the teams were auditing finances in search of tax evasion and fraud. If the team leader didn’t have a deep, technical understanding of tax fraud, he or she led the team badly astray.

The last study also looked in depth at how leaders get chosen. Tell us how that went.

Actually, this is a well-known exercise we do every year with students at Stanford. A team is given a list of items they can use to survive after a plane crash has left them in the desert. First they decide whether to stay or wait to be rescued, and then they rank order the importance of the items. We then compare their answers to that of a wilderness survival expert.

When doing this exercise in the context of our current study, one group of teams solved the problem collaboratively, without a leader. We compared these teams to a second group of teams whose members were asked to select a leader to manage group discussions, make final decisions if disagreements exist, and hand in the final rankings.

After 10 minutes of work, we took a break and the teams with leaders were informed publicly of how well each individual was doing, and how well the group was doing. Then they were asked to reconvene and rerank the items – but they could choose a new leader, as well.

This blows my mind: Only 55% of the teams chose the most expert person. Forty-five percent did not choose the most expert person, even though they knew who that was by now. Instead, they chose people who were, for example, taller, louder, or more confident.

Once again, the self-managing groups did better on the task than the teams who chose the wrong leaders, but less well than the teams with the most competent person in charge.

We’ve done this exercise for years, with similar outcomes. This means that I have watched people make poor choices about who to give a leadership role to, year after year. This is powerfully persuasive.

What lessons should managers take away from these studies?

One, we need to pay closer attention to how we choose leaders. Select for competence. Don’t get snowed by political connections or persuasiveness or the appearance of authority. Some of those things can be useful, but competence comes first. It’s essential to use objective measures of performance in hiring and promotion.

Two, pay attention to the dangers of formal hierarchy. For any important decision, you want to bring the best possible information to bear – which means you need leaders who are able to value the expertise of other team members and to share power when they’re not the person best suited to make a decision.

Three, It’s important to know who knows what. Often in a growth setting, like the ones here in Silicon Valley, you lose track. Every couple of months, a team should take stock of what challenges are most pressing, and who has deep knowledge that’s relevant to those challenges. That issue comes up in consulting engagements, too. The person who brought in the client isn’t necessarily the most knowledgeable about the work to be done: leadership roles are better assigned once you understand who knows what, and they may need to shift in the course of the project as new issues arise.

When do self-managed teams, or “holacracies,” work best?

I’ve got some interesting new research on that, but I’m not quite ready to share it. From this set of studies, here’s the lesson I see: If power can’t be aligned with the right set of competencies, an egalitarian team may be a good idea.

I want to go back to your emphasis on “competence.” By that you mean deep knowledge of the technical work being done, is that right?

Exactly. As a result of that depth, competent leaders can enable their teams to seek out new ideas and propose better solutions.

Are top-tier business schools overly focused on developing “leaders” who are ready to take charge of anything? It sounds as if what growth-oriented companies in the STEM fields need most is people who are best-in-class at the technical work, plus good at assessing other people’s strengths.

Both skill sets are important, of course, but we may be over-emphasizing generalized leadership qualities and under-emphasizing task competence. That’s a real risk.",6585

The feed includes images of marijuana plantations, back rooms of banks, children, kitchens, living rooms, garages, front gardens, back gardens, ski slopes, swimming pools, colleges and schools, laboratories, and cash register cameras in retail stores, according to Dan Tentler, a security researcher who has spent several years investigating webcam security.

""It's all over the place,"" he told Ars Technica UK. ""Practically everything you can think of.""

We did a quick search and turned up some alarming results:



https://www.shodan.io/host/85.61.172.106

https://www.shodan.io/host/111.39.88.62

https://www.shodan.io/host/82.14.157.120

The cameras are vulnerable because they use the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP, port 554) to share video but have no password authentication in place. The image feed is available to paid Shodan members at images.shodan.io. Free Shodan accounts can also search using the filter port:554 has_screenshot:true.

Shodan crawls the Internet at random looking for IP addresses with open ports. If an open port lacks authentication and streams a video feed, the new script takes a snap and moves on.

While the privacy implications here are obvious, Shodan’s new image feed also highlights the pathetic state of IoT security, and raises questions about what we are going to do to fix the problem.

Of course insecure webcams are not exactly a new thing. The last several years have seen report after report after report hammer home the point. In 2013, the FTC sanctioned webcam manufacturer TRENDnet for exposing “the private lives of hundreds of consumers to public viewing on the Internet.” Tentler told Ars he estimates there are now millions of such insecure webcams connected and easily discoverable with Shodan. That number will only continue to grow.

So why are things getting worse and not better?

The curse of the minimum viable product

Tentler told Ars that webcam manufacturers are in a race to bottom. Consumers do not perceive value in security and privacy. As a rule, many have not shown a willingness to pay for such things. As a result, webcam manufacturers slash costs to maximize their profit, often on narrow margins. Many webcams now sell for as little as £15 or $20.

""The consumers are saying 'we're not supposed to know anything about this stuff [cybersecurity],"" he said. ""The vendors don't want to lift a finger to help users because it costs them money.""

If consumers were making an informed decision and that informed decision affected no one but themselves, perhaps we could let the matter rest. But neither of those conditions are true. Most consumers fail to appreciate the consequences of purchasing insecure IoT devices. Worse, such a quantity of insecure devices makes the Internet less secure for everyone. What botnet will use vulnerable webcams to launch DDoS attacks? What malware will use insecure webcams to infect smart homes? When 2008-era malware like Conficker.B affects police body cams in 2015, it threatens not just the reliability of recorded police activity but also serves as a transmission vector to attack other devices.

""The bigger picture here is not just personal privacy, but the security of IoT devices,"" security researcher Scott Erven told Ars Technica UK. ""As we expand that connectivity, when we get into systems that affect public safety and human life—medical devices, the automotive space, critical infrastructure—the consequences of failure are higher than something as shocking as a Shodan webcam peering into the baby's crib.""

Admiring the problem is easy. Finding solutions is harder. For his part, Tentler is sceptical that raising consumer awareness will be enough to solve the problem. Despite tons of press harping on about the privacy implications of webcams, it’s pretty clear, according to Tentler, that just telling people to care more about security isn’t going to make a difference.

Instead, he argues it's time to start arm-twisting vendors to release more secure products.

FTC to the rescue?

When it comes to strong-arming manufacturers, government entities like the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may be able to help. Ars UK spoke with Maneesha Mithal, associate director of the FTC’s division of privacy and identity protection, and she was quick to mention several examples where the organization went after at-fault companies. In recent years according to Mithal, the FTC has prosecuted more than 50 cases against companies that did not reasonably secure their networks, products, or services.

The FTC takes action against companies engaged in deceptive or unfair business practices, she explained. That includes IoT manufacturers who fail to take reasonable measures to secure their devices.

“The message from our enforcement actions is that companies can’t rush to get their products to market at the expense of security,” she said. “If you don’t have reasonable security then that could be a violation of the FTC Act.”

In addition to the precedent-setting enforcement action against TRENDnet, the FTC also issued security best practices for IoT manufacturers back in January 2015, urging them to bake in security at the design phase rather than bolting it on as an afterthought. Vendors should train their employees in security best practices, the FTC said. Such practices could be a ""defence-in-depth"" strategy to mitigate risks, pushing security patches to connected devices for the duration of the product life cycle, and so forth.

This is all sensible, top-notch security advice. The FTC even followed up with an official guidance document in June and a series of workshops for businesses on improving their security posture.

It may already be too late to avoid regulation.

Then shots erupted in the halls of the country's Parliament minutes later.

The two shootings in Ottawa Wednesday left lawmakers barricaded inside offices and parts of the city on lockdown for hours as police searched for suspects.

Ottawa Police lifted the lockdown Wednesday night and said there was no longer a danger to the public.

But many questions remain about the shootings: Who was the gunman? Why did he open fire? And was he acting alone?

""It appears there was just one shooter, and that shooter is dead,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""But it has been a traumatic experience, obviously, for not only our city but the country.""

Investigators haven't provided any possible motives for the shooting. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper didn't provide details about the investigation in a televised address to the nation Wednesday night.

""In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had, but this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,"" Harper said. ""Let there be no misunderstanding: We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.""

It is unclear whether additional suspects were tied to the shootings or whether additional arrests have been made. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more information would be provided in a press conference Thursday.

As authorities continued to investigate, details began to emerge about the man they suspect was behind the shooting.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was identified by Canadian officials to their American counterparts as the suspected gunman, multiple U.S. officials told CNN.

Bibeau, who was born in 1982, was a convert to Islam and had a history of drug use before he converted, two sources said.

His passport had been confiscated by Canadian authorities when they learned he planned to go fight overseas, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN's Susan Candiotti. The official said it was not clear when that happened.

Canadian broadcaster CBC reported that Bibeau had a record of drug arrests going back 10 years.

'Murdered in cold blood'

Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was ""murdered in cold blood"" as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial, Harper said, expressing condolences to the slain Canadian soldier's family.

The soldier appeared to have been shot in the back, said Peter Henderson, a journalist who was at the memorial at the time of the shooting. Other soldiers who were nearby doing drills at the time ran to help, he said.

Three people brought to The Ottawa Hospital after the shootings have been released, hospital spokeswoman Hazel Harding told CNN. Earlier, they were described as being in stable condition.

Shortly after the shooting at the memorial, a gunman entered the nearby building on Parliament Hill, officials said.

""I heard rapid fire -- gunshots going very loud -- and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,"" Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux told CNN. He was one level below the gunshots.

Gunfire first erupted in the building's foyer. Then a second round of shooting happened about a minute later in a hallway or near the entrance to the Parliament's library, Wingrove told CNN.

Several officers had weapons drawn, he said, and most of the dozens of shots that he heard appeared to have been fired by officers at the gunman.

When the shooting ended, a person was lying motionless on the ground near the library entrance, Wingrove said.

Parliament member James Lunney tweeted: #HOC in Lockdown, lone gunman shot security guard, shot his way down Hall of Honor....we are all safe. Gunman dead! Thnk God & our scrty!""

In Twitter posts, several Canadian lawmakers hailed a top security official as a hero, crediting him with shooting the gunman inside Parliament.

""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" Craig Scott, a member of Parliament, wrote.

Another soldier killed Monday

A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that a connection to terrorism hasn't been ruled out.

On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" killed a Canadian soldier with his car. The man was then shot and killed.

There was no immediate indication that the Monday and Wednesday incidents were related.

In response to the shootings, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, has increased its alert posture, CNN has learned. That means that it has increased the number of planes on a higher alert status ready to respond if needed. NORAD and Canadian authorities are in contact, an official told CNN.

Prime Minister secure during shooting

MP Tony Clement tweeted that he heard ""at least 30 shots"" and apparently was able to take cover with colleagues. He also tweeted that Prime Minister Harper was secure.

Harper was safely evacuated from the building, tweeted his press secretary, Carl Vallee.

Hours after the Parliament attack, Harper spoke by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama.

""Obviously, we're all shaken by it,"" Obama later told reporters, ""but we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're standing side by side with Canada during this difficult time.""

Watson said that Wednesday was ""a sad and tragic day for our city and our country.""

The violence at Parliament comes just days after Canada raised its terror alert Friday.

The suspect in Monday's vehicle attack, Martin Rouleau Couture, reportedly converted to Islam about a year ago. Police arrested him last July and confiscated his passport, but lacked enough evidence to keep him in custody, said Martine Fontaine of the RCMP.

489887806018183168,false,Malaysia Airlines executive releases partial list of passengers' nationalities: http://t.co/WbRwJCmzVx http://t.co/KD2yo06uWR #MH17,http://wapo.st/1l9uB6k,True,Malaysia Airlines plane crashes in Ukraine,"In the hours after a Malaysia Airlines plane crashed in eastern Ukraine, the only thing immediately clear was that nearly 300 people had died. Beyond that, there was confusion, as groups and officials began making claims and counterclaims, accusations and rebuttals, with no unequivocal answers as to who was responsible for shooting down the Boeing 777.

The arguments began almost immediately, as the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatist rebels in Ukraine quickly blamed each other for the crashing of Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. But as comments were posted on social media sites and taken down, and as audio recordings were produced and fingers pointed, things only became more and more murky.

U.S. intelligence officials confirmed Thursday that the plane was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. But analysts were still scrambling to determine who actually fired the missile.

An official with the Ukrainian government quickly claimed that pro-Russian rebels used a missile system to shoot down the plane. Anton Herashenko, adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, wrote on Facebook that a Buk anti-aircraft missile system — which he said was provided to the rebels by Russian President Vladimir Putin — shot down the plane in an area held by pro-Russian rebels.

Like Herashenko, Putin, in televised remarks, also blamed the rebels for the crash. But they denied responsibility and blamed the Ukrainian government, arguing that they lacked the capabilities to shoot down a commercial airliner.

“The plane was shot down by the Ukrainian side,” said Serhiy Kavtaradze, a member of the rebels’ security council, according to Interfax. “We simply do not have such air defense systems.”

Kavtaradze said the rebels have shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles with “a firing range of only 3,000 to 4,000 meters” — about 10,000 to 13,000 feet — and that passenger jets fly at much higher altitudes.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied that the government shot down the plane, saying that Ukraine’s armed forces “did not take action against any airborne targets,” according to the Associated Press.

While rebels in eastern Ukraine denied having the rocket launcher needed for such an attack, journalists with the Associated Press had reported seeing a similar weapon in this region earlier in the day. The Buk missile system is capable of reaching a plane expected to be flying between 33,000 and 37,000 feet.

And in a conversation between President Obama and Putin on Thursday morning discussing recent U.S. sanctions against Russia, Obama noted “extensive evidence that Russia is significantly increasing the provision of heavy weapons to separatists in Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement.

Adding to the confusion, the Ukraine Security Service later released a recording of what it claimed were intercepted phone calls capturing pro-Russian separatists discussing shooting down a plane. The Washington Post could not independently verify the recording or any of the individuals on it. (Three Russian language speakers working for The Washington Post have verified the English translation used here.)

The recording appears to be a composite of three separate conversations; at one point, a voice on the recording identified by the Ukrainian intelligence agency says either “we have just shot down a plane” or “they have just downed the plane.” In another portion of the recording, one voice describes seeing “lots of corpses of women and children” on the ground.

“They say on TV it’s an AN-26 transport plane, but they say it’s written Malaysia Airlines on the plane,” the voice said. “What was it doing on Ukraine’s territory?”

Another posting that appeared to comment on the plane appeared on a social media site before being shot down. Not long after the plane went down, a social media page frequently attributed in Ukrainian media to Igor Girkin, a Russian citizen who describes himself as a rebel military leader, seemed to post something that appeared to claim responsibility for the downed plane.

“We have just shot down an AN-26 plane in the Torez region, it is lying somewhere near the Progress mine,” read the post at 5:50 p.m. Moscow time on the social media site VKontakte. “We have warned emphatically: Do not fly in ‘our sky.’”

The Washington Post has not confirmed that the posting was created by Girkin or someone associated with the rebels. The post, which appeared to suggest that the pro-Russian forces thought the aircraft was a Ukrainian military transport plane, claimed to offer “video confirmation” of the crash. However, after news emerged that the downed plane was a commercial airliner, the post was removed.

Ukrainian officials also said that two other planes were shot down earlier in the week: A Ukrainian air force jet, which they said was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane on Wednesday; and a military transport plane, which they said was shot down Monday by a missile fired from Russian territory.

World leaders and politicians quickly reacted to the crash, offering condolences and assistance, but some reactions were muddled based on the confusion. Sen. John McCain (R) told reporters Thursday afternoon that “the culpable party here is Putin,” though he admitted that his comments were based solely on news reports, which at the time were inconclusive and lacking many details.

This confusion is likely to linger, because any investigation is expected to be complicated by the fighting in the region. A Ukrainian regional official said after the crash that rebels did not allow the government access to the plane for the first hour, while Russian officials are insisting that they have a right to be included in any investigation of the crash. And pro-Russian separatists told Interfax they had found “black box” flight recorders at the crash scene, saying later that they planned to give them to officials in Moscow.

Meanwhile, the plane was filled with Dutch, Malaysian, Australian and Indonesian citizens, among others, which meant that the crash transcended the Ukrainian-Russian border and touched countries around the world. So in addition to Russian officials wanting to be part of the investigation, other countries could also insist on being part of the efforts to understand the crash.

The French justice minister has resigned, blaming a ""major political disagreement"" with her government.

Christiane Taubira stepped down from her job shortly before anti-terrorism proposals that she disagreed with went before parliament.

If passed, the laws would mean that people who are convicted of terrorism offences are stripped of citizenship.

The plans were put forward after the 13 November Paris attacks in which 130 people were murdered.

""I left the government over a major political disagreement,"" Ms Taubira said.

""I am choosing to be true to myself, to my commitments, my battles and my relationships with other people.""

Image copyright Christiane Taubira Image caption ""Sometimes staying on is resisting, sometimes resisting means leaving,"" Ms Taubira tweeted

Many of the Islamist militants who carried out attacks in France and have joined the jihadist Islamic State (IS) group have had dual citizenship.

Ms Taubira was among several figures on the left who objected to the government's proposals because they singled out those with dual nationality.

However, the law went before a parliamentary commission shortly after her resignation on Wednesday with no reference to dual nationality.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls presented the revised article of the constitution to parliament, ahead of a debate scheduled to start in early February.

State of emergency

France has been under a state of emergency since the night of the Paris attacks. It allows suspects to be placed under house arrest and for meetings or demonstrations to be banned.

A high court ruled on Wednesday that the state of emergency can continue. A human rights group had challenged plans for its extension, but the judge said ""imminent danger"" had not gone away. The ruling was made in the Council of State, France's highest administrative court.

Patrice Spinosi, the lawyer for the League for Human Rights, told the French newspaper Le Monde that the persistence of an ""unidentified threat"" was not enough justification for continuing the state of emergency.

Prime Minister Valls has previously told the BBC that the state of emergency should remain in place ""for as long as necessary"".

Racist taunts

Image copyright EPA Image caption Ms Taubira was known to disapprove of the citizenship reform but appeared alongside the prime minister when he announced it

One of France's few senior black politicians, Christiane Taubira, 63, has been replaced by Jean-Jacques Urvoas who is seen as a supporter of the constitutional change and an ally of Prime Minister Valls.

Born in French Guiana, Ms Taubira has suffered racist taunts from the far-right during her time as justice minister.

Her left-wing leanings have put her increasingly at odds with official policy, especially after the November attacks when the president announced a much tougher line on terrorism, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield reports.

A communique from the Elysee Palace said that President Francois Hollande had accepted the justice minister's decision to resign.

""They agreed on the need to bring her role to an end at a time when debate on constitutional revision begins in the National Assembly, today,"" the statement read.

In his communique, President Hollande also praised Ms Taubira's part in pushing through same-sex marriage laws.

Darling of the left, by Hugh Schofield, BBC News Paris

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Christiane Taubira blows a kiss as she leaves a 2014 meeting at the Elysee Palace

President Hollande is going to miss Christiane Taubira because she performed a vital role in his government. Every time he took a move to the right, or was accused of doing so, he could point to his justice minister and say: ""Don't worry, Christiane's still with me.""

She was his left-wing shield, and he kept her in office to ward off attacks from inside the Socialists over his increasingly pro-business economic policies, and (since November) his tough new line on terror.

Taubira was the darling of the left. Pugnacious and outspoken, she saw through the gay marriage law, and promoted a liberal line on police and sentencing. By the same token, the right despised her and there is now much rejoicing in their ranks.

In the end, President Hollande could no longer pull off the act of political splits which allowed his government to include such mutually hostile forces as Manuel Valls (on the right) and Taubira (on the left).

The times being as they are, it was the left-winger who went.

EU at grave risk, says Valls

Was Salim Benghalem Paris attacks ringleader?

Who were the victims of Paris attacks?

Last month the justice minister made plain her distaste of the plan to strip citizens with dual nationality of their French citizenship, arguing it ""would not help the fight against terrorism in any way"".

She said the plan was being dropped only for it be announced the following day by the prime minister with her appearing beside him.

Mr Valls said at the time that it was a ""strong symbolic act against those who have excluded themselves from the national community"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption French Prime Minister Manuel Valls spoke to the BBC's Lyse Doucet

He presented the proposals before a parliamentary commission at the National Assembly on Wednesday before they were due to go before MPs next week.

No mention was made of dual nationals, apparently in response to criticism that it could lead to two types of nationality and to people being stigmatised.

However, the French government has made clear that no-one should be made stateless as a result of the reform, implying that it could only ever be used against people with dual citizenship.

Mr Valls told the BBC last week that France could not live forever under a state of emergency but as long as the threat remained all means had to be used ""until we can defeat Daesh (so-called Islamic State).

The reforms include the right to declare a state of emergency under the constitution, which would make it easier for the French government to adopt strict powers such as police raids and house arrests.

Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.

Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school.

Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million.

An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school’s Investment Club, was basically a genius.

As the news spread, Mo’s stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20, and Mo became a celebrity, as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. A VIP!

Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. He’s quiet today, said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. Humble. And tired: This is our third meeting of the day, Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you 

Next we’re going to see a hedge-fund guy, Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.

He basically wants to give us $150 million, Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.

The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. Freshly squeezed apple juice, Damir said, passing them around. It’s very good. Do you like caviar?

After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (Aren’t you the kid who made all that money? a teacher asked him.) So he reconnected with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, the one percent of the one percent.

The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. I call the poker game Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. Here, have some caviar.

Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. There are a lot of steps we have to follow through, said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. But we’re on the right track. They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. Mo’s our maestro, Patrick said. He’s going to be earning the big bucks. We’re just going to try to fill his needs.

All three plan to attend college next year, but they’re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: A billion dollars! Damir said. By next year! Mo affirmed the number with a nod. But it’s not just about money, he added. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers 

Like in Wolf of Wall Street! Damir interjected. And Mo is Jordan Belfort.

No, but, not like that, Patrick said, blanching slightly.

Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of riskthe way his hand shook making the tradebut he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. I didn’t have the balls for it, he said. He was 9.

It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. I had been paralyzed by my loss, Mo said. But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’  Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures. More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattanthough his parents won’t let him live in it until he turns 18and acquire a BMW, which he can’t drive because he doesn’t yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones’s Greenwich house for inspiration. It’s because he is who he is that made me who I am today, Mo said.

Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think it’s a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating

Money never sleeps! Damir added. That’s from the Wall Street movie.

It all comes down to this, Mo continued. What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.

The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400.

New York, that’s where the money’s at, Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card.

This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that’s where the money is. Damir grinned. My father has a quote, he said. It’s really dope: You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank.’ 

Patrick buried his face in his hands. At the end of the day, he said, we’re young kids.",6478

Interfax news agency said the plane came down 20miles (50kms) short of entering Russian airspace.

It ""began to drop, afterwards it was found burning on the ground on Ukrainian territory,"" an unnamed source said.

Reuters quoted emergency service personnel at the scene who said body parts from the plane's passengers are scattered around up to 15km from the crash site, and at least 100 bodies were on the ground.

As the drama unfolded, several other passenger jets were flying through Ukrainian airspace on one of the main routes from Europe to Asia for air traffic.

The jets path would have seen it flying at high altitude on an intercontinental flight that took it over the crisis hit region of Ukraine, where the authorities have accused Russia-backed separatists of previous attacks on aircraft.

Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor at Ukraine's interior ministry, told Bloomberg it was Ukrainian rebels who shot down the plane.

Writing on his Facebook page, Gerashenko claimed the plane had been hit by a missile from a Buk launcher, which can fire up to an altitude of 22,000 meters (72,000 feet).

Earlier on Thursday the Ukrainian authorities said one of their fighter jets was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane and Ukrainian troops were fired upon by missiles from a village inside Russia.

A similar launcher was reported by journalists near the eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne on Thursday.

Andrew MacDonald, at defence analysts Vision Gain told HuffPost UK initial reports that pro-Russian rebels were responsible for downing the plane were ""quite plausible"".

He said: ""Earlier today separatist fighters claimed to have shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 ground attack fighter in the area, so the goal may be to create a de-facto no-fly zone in the east of the country in a show of force after their ousting from Slovyansk.

""However, the aircraft will at that stage in its flight will have been cruising at a very high altitude – around 30,000 feet – so would have been well out of range of any shoulder-launched MANPADS weapons you might expect insurgent groups to possess.

Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor at Ukraine's interior ministry, told Bloomberg it was Ukrainian rebels who shot down the plane.

Writing on his Facebook page, Gerashenko claimed the plane had been hit by a missile from a Buk launcher, which can fire up to an altitude of 22,000 meters (72,000 feet).

Earlier on Thursday the Ukrainian authorities said one of their fighter jets was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane and Ukrainian troops were fired upon by missiles from a village inside Russia.

A similar launcher was reported by journalists near the eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne on Thursday.

Though duly impressed with Mr. Wohlleben’s ability to capture the public’s attention, some German biologists question his use of words, like “talk” rather than the more standard “communicate,” to describe what goes on between trees in the forest.

But this, says Mr. Wohlleben, who invites readers to imagine what a tree might feel when its bark tears (“Ouch!”), is exactly the point. “I use a very human language,” he explained. “Scientific language removes all the emotion, and people don’t understand it anymore. When I say, ‘Trees suckle their children,’ everyone knows immediately what I mean.”

Still No. 1 on the Spiegel best-seller list for nonfiction, “Hidden Life” has sold 320,000 copies and has been optioned for translation in 19 countries (Canada’s Greystone Books will publish an English version in September). “It’s one of the biggest successes of the year,” said Denis Scheck, a German literary critic who praised the humble narrative style and the book’s ability to awaken in readers an intense, childlike curiosity about the workings of the world.

The popularity of “The Hidden Life of Trees,” Mr. Scheck added, says less about Germany than it does about modern life. People who spend most of their time in front of computers want to read about nature. “Germans are reputed to have a special relationship with the forest, but it’s kind of a cliché,” Mr. Scheck said. “Yes, there’s Hansel and Gretel, and, sure, if your marriage fails, you go for a long hike in the woods. But I don’t think Germans love their forest more than Swedes or Norwegians or Finns.”

MR. WOHLLEBEN traces his own love of the forest to his early childhood. Growing up in the 1960s and ’70s in Bonn, then the West German capital, he raised spiders and turtles, and liked playing outside more than any of his three siblings did. In high school, a generation of young, left-leaning teachers painted a dire picture of the world’s ecological future, and he decided it was his mission to help.

He studied forestry, and began working for the state forestry administration in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1987. Later, as a young forester in charge of a 3,000-odd acre woodlot in the Eifel region, about an hour outside Cologne, he felled old trees and sprayed logs with insecticides. But he did not feel good about it: “I thought, ‘What am I doing? I’m making everything kaput.’ ”

Reading up on the behavior of trees — a topic he learned little about in forestry school — he found that, in nature, trees operate less like individuals and more as communal beings. Working together in networks and sharing resources, they increase their resistance.

By artificially spacing out trees, the plantation forests that make up most of Germany’s woods ensure that trees get more sunlight and grow faster. But, naturalists say, creating too much space between trees can disconnect them from their networks, stymieing some of their inborn resilience mechanisms.

Intrigued, Mr. Wohlleben began investigating alternate approaches to forestry. Visiting a handful of private forests in Switzerland and Germany, he was impressed. “They had really thick, old trees,” he said. “They treated their forest much more lovingly, and the wood they produced was more valuable. In one forest, they said, when they wanted to buy a car, they cut two trees. For us, at the time, two trees would buy you a pizza.”

Back in the Eifel in 2002, Mr. Wohlleben set aside a section of “burial woods,” where people could bury cremated loved ones under 200-year-old trees with a plaque bearing their names, bringing in revenue without harvesting any wood. The project was financially successful. But, Mr. Wohlleben said, his bosses were unhappy with his unorthodox activities. He wanted to go further — for example, replacing heavy logging machinery, which damages forest soil, with horses — but could not get permission.

After a decade of struggling with his higher-ups, he decided to quit. “I consulted with my family first,” said Mr. Wohlleben, who is married and has two children. Though it meant giving up the ironclad security of employment as a German civil servant, “I just thought, ‘I cannot do this the rest of my life.’”

The family planned to emigrate to Sweden. But it turned out that Mr. Wohlleben had won over the forest’s municipal owners.

So, 10 years ago, the municipality took a chance. It ended its contract with the state forestry administration, and hired Mr. Wohlleben directly. He brought in horses, eliminated insecticides and began experimenting with letting the woods grow wilder. Within two years, the forest went from loss to profit, in part by eliminating expensive machinery and chemicals.

Despite his successes, in 2009 Mr. Wohlleben started having panic attacks. “I kept thinking, ‘Ah! You only have 20 years, and you still have to accomplish this, and this, and that.’” He began therapy, to treat burnout and depression. It helped. “I learned to be happy about what I’ve done so far,” he said. “With a forest, you have to think in terms of 200 or 300 years. I learned to accept that I can’t do everything. Nobody can.”

He wanted to write “The Hidden Life of Trees” to show laypeople how great trees are.

Stopping to consider a tree that rose up straight then curved like a question mark, Mr. Wohlleben said, however, that it was the untrained perspective of visitors he took on forest tours years ago to which he owed much insight.

“For a forester, this tree is ugly, because it is crooked, which means you can’t get very much money for the wood,” he said. “It really surprised me, walking through the forest, when people called a tree like this one beautiful. They said, ‘My life hasn’t always run in a straight line, either.’ And I began to see things with new eyes.”",6416
510507736287961088,unverified,US govt reportedly threatened to prosecute family of kidnapped journalist Jim Foley if it paid ransom http://t.co/f5c4fvaZmT h/t @acarvin,http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963#.VBNGHXsunYU.twitter,True,'So Little Compassion': James Foley's Parents Say Officials Threatened Family Over Ransom,"The mother of slain American journalist James Foley said she wasn’t necessarily surprised that the U.S. government threatened her family with prosecution should they raise money to pay her son’s ransom, but she was astounded by how such a devastating message was delivered.

“I was surprised there was so little compassion,” Diane Foley told ABC News today of the three separate warnings she said U.S. officials gave the family about the illegality of paying ransom to the terror group ISIS. “It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted… I’m sure [the U.S. official] didn’t mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing… meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.”

Earlier this week five current and former officials with direct knowledge of the Foley case confirmed the alleged threats were made.

""It was an utterly idiotic thing to do that came across as if [the U.S. official] had the compassion of an anvil,"" said a former official who has advised the family.

Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foley’s brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.

“It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust… that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,” Diane Foley said.

The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.

Digital Globe

Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didn’t seem like anything was being done.

“But we’re not politicians, we’re not government people, we don’t know,” she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family “had no idea” because the government didn’t tell them.

At times, Diane Foley said the family “had to beg” the government for information on their son.

“We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level… They didn’t have time for us,” she said.

Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters he’s “not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.”

“It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,” Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foley’s situation to the Justice Department.

Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was “really taken aback [and] surprised” by Foley’s allegations. “I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,” Kerry said.

State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families “understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.”

“But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,” Harf said.

Obtained by ABC News

Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.

""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.

The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.

Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.

""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.

The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.

Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.

Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""

""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.

In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. government’s treatment of the families of hostages, “As Americans, we can do better.”

(Reuters) - Minutes before a police officer shot him dead, Michael Brown had become a suspect in the theft of cigars from a store, according to police reports released on Friday after days of protests in a St. Louis suburb over the unarmed black teenager’s death.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announces the name of the officer involved in the shooting of Michael Brown as officer Darren Wilson, in Ferguson, Missouri August 15, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson

But what, if anything, that had to do with the fatal encounter became less clear as the day went by. Hours after the reports’ release, police said that Officer Darren Wilson, 28, had no idea 18-year-old Brown was a robbery suspect. He simply wanted Brown to move from the road to the sidewalk, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said at a news conference

“He was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. That was it,” Jackson said.

After nearly a week of accusations that the Ferguson Police Department did not know how to communicate with the public, Jackson did little to dispel that image during two appearances on Friday.

He was visibly nervous, stuttering as he fumbled his notes, and made announcements that only sowed more confusion. After releasing the robbery incident report without any attempt to explain its fuller context, he let more than five hours pass before confirming, and only when asked, that Wilson did not know about the robbery when he encountered Brown.

The decision by the police department, which is overwhelmingly white, to release a report on the robbery while keeping details of the shooting secret only served to fuel outrage that has roiled the St. Louis area.

After identifying Wilson as the officer involved in the shooting, Jackson described the officer as a “gentleman” who has been devastated by the incident. Wilson worked four of his six years as an officer on the Ferguson police force, the chief said.

Wilson’s identity has been kept a secret since the Aug. 9 shooting and authorities had been under mounting pressure to both identify the officer and to provide details about the investigation to ease unrest in the largely black community.

Since Saturday’s killing, which took place shortly after noon on a street running through a quiet, tree-lined residential neighborhood, protesters have converged on Ferguson, casting a spotlight on area racial tensions.

Anger over the shooting brought thousands of protesters into the streets of Ferguson, and triggered nightly clashes from Sunday through Wednesday with police officers in riot gear.

Civil rights groups have complained that Brown’s death is the latest in a long history of racial profiling and harassment by police, and discriminatory arrests.

Some residents saw the police report on the robbery as the latest example of the pattern.

“This is how the police operate here, they always defame the name of the victim,” said area resident Arthur Austin, 39. “The more I hear, the less I trust what the police are saying.”

RALLY ON SUNDAY

A Brown family attorney said it appeared to be Brown in the convenience store’s security-camera footage, which showed the teenager shoving a store clerk during an apparent robbery. Dorian Johnson, the friend who was with Brown that day, told the FBI and Justice Department officials about the robbery this week, his lawyer said.

Anthony Gray, a Brown family attorney, said the talk of a robbery was “unfair” to the family and a “distraction” raised by police. He said the real issue was why Wilson shot an unarmed Brown as the teenager held his arms in the air in a sign of surrender, as two witnesses described.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the civil rights group National Action Network, which is paying for Brown’s funeral, issued a statement on Friday condemning what he called a “smear campaign” against the teenager.

Sharpton said he would lead a rally in Ferguson on Sunday with Brown’s family, who expressed outrage at the police report in a statement on Twitter.

“There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up, which is the universal sign of surrender,” the statement said.

According to the account given by Jackson and the police reports his department released, police received a call about the robbery and an ensuing altercation with a clerk at 11:51 a.m. on Aug. 9. A suspect description went out over police radio.

Officer Wilson left a prior call he was on and then encountered Brown at 12:01 p.m. Three minutes later Wilson had fatally shot Brown, and other officers and an ambulance were dispatched to the scene, Jackson said.

Wilson, who has been put on paid administrative leave, has been shielded from the public since the incident. A lone police car sat outside Wilson’s single-story brick house on Friday, and neighbors posted signs on their doors asking to be left alone. One neighbor said Wilson had not been seen for days.

Another posted a sign on their door that read simply: “We don’t know anything. Pray for peace.”

The police version that has thus far been provided of Brown’s shooting differs markedly from witness accounts, including that of his friend Johnson.

In their earlier account, police said Brown reached into the patrol car and struggled with Wilson before the officer pulled his service gun and shot Brown multiple times. Wilson sustained a facial injury, which was treated in a hospital, they said.

But Johnson and one other witness have said that Brown was trying to get away from the officer, who tried to grab him after telling him to move off the street and onto a sidewalk.

Brown held up his hands in a sign of surrender but was shot several times, they said.

Police have acknowledged that Brown’s body was more than 30 feet away (nine meters) from the police car when he collapsed and died and that multiple shell casings were found at the scene.",6286
531526274003771392,unverified,2 Iraqi officials and state TV say airstrike wounds Islamic State group leader al-Baghdadi  - @AP http://t.co/1e1iqoYjZT,http://bit.ly/1ANPTDl,True,Iraqi officials say IS leader wounded in airstrike,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi officials said Sunday that the head of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was wounded in an airstrike in western Anbar province. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured.

Iraq's Defense and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night.

The reports came at a time when President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the Islamic State militants.

Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force.

He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official, cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material.

A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defense Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defense official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of Islamic State leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering.

Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials.

The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armored vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town.

When asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: ""We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.""

Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some Islamic State militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal.

""They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,"" Abdurrahman said.

There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal.

The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.

Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011.

On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce.

The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province.

Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces.

In an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance.

""Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offense,"" Obama said.

""The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,"" he added.

Now they are investigating whether the police apprehended the students after the confrontation and deliberately turned them over to the local gang. Two witnesses in custody told prosecutors that the gang then killed the protesters on the orders of a leader known as El Chucky.

“I saw police trucks go up and down the hill to up there, where the bodies are found,” said one man in the neighborhood near the site who declined to give his name out of fear. “Then came the news they found the grave and it may be the students. But you would be a fool around here to accuse the police and expect to live.”

UNITED STATES 500 miles MEXICO Gulf of Mexico Mexico City Pacific Ocean Iguala GUATEMALA

Even in a country accustomed to mass killings, the case has generated alarm, both for the possible involvement of the police and for the fact that the students were not known to have criminal ties. Miguel Martínez, a representative for the families, said students at the school had fought back against extortion attempts by gangs last year, but it was not clear if that could have made them a target now.

The students, by many accounts, had been soliciting money in Iguala for an Oct. 2 demonstration rejecting cuts to their state-financed school, which opened in 1926 and has long played a role in local social justice movements. Such student demonstrations are part of a well-known militancy that goes back decades and has provoked violence in the past. It did again this time, as students got into a skirmish with the police when they tried to steal buses to take to and from the demonstration, human rights groups said.

The mayor and the police chief of Iguala are now on the run, having disappeared after being subpoenaed in the case, and the governor of the state confirmed that the local gang, known as Guerreros Unidos, had infiltrated the police force in Iguala, as well as other police departments in the state.

The specter of corrupted police has haunted Mexico for years. But these disappearances come at a time when President Enrique Peña Nieto is already confronting the prosecution of at least three soldiers charged with homicide in another recent case — the shooting death of 22 people captured in a warehouse in June.

“I feel deeply outraged and dismayed,” Mr. Peña Nieto told reporters Monday, referring to the violence here and dispatching the attorney general and other federal forces to the region. “I regret, in particular, the violence that occurred and especially that it was young students who were affected and whose rights were violated in the city of Iguala.”

Mr. Peña Nieto’s predecessor, Felipe Calderón, also faced wave after wave of police corruption scandals, with some entire local forces dismissed. But experts say that, even as violence soared, both administrations fell behind in putting in place measures to hold law enforcement authorities accountable.

Only this year did Mexico pass a law allowing members of the military to be tried in civilian courts for human rights abuses, and many feel that Mr. Peña Nieto has been more focused on shifting the dialogue to Mexico’s economy than on fighting corruption and improving security.

“A serious and sustained effort at reforming local police agencies has been a pending agenda for a long time in Mexico,” said Matthew C. Ingram, an assistant professor at the University at Albany who studies justice in Mexico. “As long as local, municipal police agencies remain weak, they will not have the capacity to generate public trust or resist corruption and capture.”

Here at the small, 500-student mountaintop teachers college, Escuela Normal Rural Raúl Isidro Burgos, where cows and stray dogs roam freely and walls are adorned with slogans like “protest is a right, repression is a crime,” a hodgepodge of human rights and radical groups and representatives of the families have vowed paralyzing strikes across the country on Wednesday to keep the pressure on the authorities for answers.

Parents of the missing students doubt the effectiveness of state investigators. A team of forensic experts from Argentina with long experience in mass disappearance cases has arrived, and on Monday it began interviewing family members and collecting other data as part of an independent investigation, though it was unclear if the experts would have access to the bodies found.

States officials said it could take at least two weeks and possibly longer to identify the remains because of their poor condition.

And if the bodies are not those of the missing students, the question remains: Where did they come from?

Several parents said they still hoped their children would be found alive. Although the number of missing has fluctuated, the current list of 43 was developed after students and human rights representatives said they had called family members and friends and searched school grounds and other places, failing to account for 43 classmates.

“We have to keep looking and praying,” said Santa Cruz Castro, the father of Leonel.

He last spoke to his son when Leonel called him the day of the confrontation, saying, “Don’t worry, Dad, I am going to the march,” which Mr. Cruz took to mean the collection drive in Iguala. “And then I didn’t hear from him and saw the news about the shootings. We didn’t know what to do.”

In a sign of defiance and concern, placards and bumper stickers are popping up here and in other cities in Guerrero on buses, storefronts and buildings. Their slogan — #HastaEncontrarlos — means: “Until they are found.”",6151
510931521306243072,true,UPDATE: UK Prime Minister David #Cameron describes apparent beheading of David #Haines as 'an act of pure evil' http://t.co/bOVQsHmUjl,http://fxn.ws/1qxIZNb,True,British PM David Cameron says he will 'drain this poison' after latest ISIS beheading video,"British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday he will work with allies to defeat the terrorist group Islamic State, and that countries must “drain this poison from our society,” after the militants released a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines.

Cameron, who was attending a wedding on Saturday, raced back to London overnight to chair a meeting of his security Cabinet, including his advisers, officials and intelligence chiefs. The Prime Minister described the murder of Haines as ""an act of pure evil"" in a tweet from his official account.

The 44-year-old Haines was abducted in Syria in 2013 while working for an international aid agency. The British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until another video recently released by Islamic State, also known as ISIS, identified him as a captive.

The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) September 13, 2014

“We must confront this menace. We must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy [ISIS],” Cameron said in his remarks Sunday. He reiterated that Islam is a religion of peace, and said of the militants, “they are not Muslims; they are monsters.”

He warned against being complacent, advising that “the problem will merely get worse, not just for us, but for Europe and the world.” He said that Britain would not work to destroy Islamic State on its own, but will be “working with others to extinguish this terrorist threat.” Cameron said Britain supports the U.S. decision to take direct military action.

The British Foreign Office said late Saturday that it was ""working urgently to verify the video,"" but Cameron's statement left no room for ambiguity. Fox News confirmed that the tape is being examined by the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington.

""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,"" Cameron added.

In a statement released late Saturday, President Obama condemned the murder as ""barbaric.""

""The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL. Our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve,"" the statement read.

""We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.""

In the video, the victim identifies himself as Haines before addressing the camera.

""I would like to declare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution,"" the victim says.

""You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend against our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say 'no' to the Americans.""

After he speaks, the executioner dressed in black, speaking with an English accent, addresses Cameron.

""This British man has to the pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State,"" the militant says. ""If you, Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State then you like your master Obama will have the blood of your people on your hands.""

The video emerged a day after Haines' family issued a public plea late Friday urging his captors to contact them. The Foreign Office said it was offering Haines' family ""every support possible. They ask to be left alone at this time.""

Islamic State militants have beheaded two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, as well as Kurdish and Lebanese fighters, and posted video evidence online. At the end of the last video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff, the Islamic State group threatened to kill Haines next and briefly showed him on camera.

In the video posted Sunday, the group threatened to kill another Briton. Both British men were dressed in orange jumpsuits against an arid Syrian landscape, similar to that seen in the Foley and Sotloff videos.

The SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, reported the video, which was also posted online by users associated with the Islamic State group.

Mike Haines said in a statement issued by the Foreign Office that his brother was devoted to humanitarian work.

""David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles,"" Mike Haines said. ""His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair. He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.""

At the time of his abduction, Haines was working for the French international aid agency ACTED which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and rebel groups, including the ISIS, seeking to oust him. ACTED said in a statement earlier this month that Haines had worked with as an international aid worker since 1999, helping victims of conflict in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East. Before heading to Syria, ACTED said Haines had worked in 2012 as a ""non-partisan unarmed civilian peace facilitator"" in South Sudan.

British media have reported that Haines, who is married to a Croatian woman, was educated in Scotland, and spent 11 years serving in the British Royal Air Force before becoming an international aid worker. Britain's Press Association said Haines had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage and a 4-year-old daughter from his present marriage.

765141361033109504,non-rumor,Man who died after being shot with Taser by police in Shropshire believed to be ex-football star Dalian Atkinson https://t.co/K08f3NHxpV,http://bbc.in/2bhndwG,True,Dalian Atkinson dies after being Tasered in Telford by police,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""I saw him hit the ground"": One eyewitness talks to the BBC's Sian Lloyd

Former footballer Dalian Atkinson has died after being shot with a Taser by police at his father's house.

Police said the weapon was deployed at about 01:30 BST in Telford, Shropshire after officers were called to a report of concern for a man's safety.

A neighbour described seeing the former Aston Villa star, 48, being Tasered after ""stumbling towards"" police.

Mr Atkinson went into cardiac arrest on his way to hospital, where he was pronounced dead at about 03:00.

Paula Quinn, who lives in a first-floor flat near the Atkinson property in Trench, said: ""They were shouting and kicking so much all I could hear were the boots hitting him.

'Lead balloon'

""And then the officer who released the Taser stepped back while the other officer still continued to kick and then I could hear him shout to the other officer that was still kicking, 'Back off, back off, back off.'

""And then the officer with the Taser asked the gentleman to put his hands behind his back and did so probably two or three times and reactivated the Taser another four or five times after that. ""

The death has been referred to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

It declined to comment on Ms Quinn's claims, but said the ""the level and type of force used"" was one of the elements of its investigation into police contact with Mr Atkinson before his death.

Ms Quinn was the only eyewitness spoken to by the BBC who reported seeing officers kick Mr Atkinson or use the Taser while he was on the ground.

She had earlier told the Shropshire Star Mr Atkinson had ""seemed a bit, perhaps, inebriated"", adding: ""As the Taser hit him in the stomach he just went 'doof', down like a lead balloon.""

Paramedics said Mr Atkinson went into cardiac arrest on his way to hospital.

His nephew, Fabian, said the former footballer was having dialysis treatment for kidney problems: ""And obviously that's inevitably why his heart was weaker.

""They need to, as soon as they deploy a Taser, they need to deploy an ambulance. As soon as, it should be mandatory.

""Because, how do they know, unnaturally putting volts through a body, how do they know they're going to survive that, eventually, in the long run, that they're not going to need any medical attention?""

Mr Atkinson is best remembered for scoring the Match of the Day goal of the season in the 1992-93 campaign - the inaugural Premier League season. Memorably, the Villa star dribbled the ball from inside his own half before chipping the Wimbledon keeper from the edge of the area.

Aston Villa, for whom the striker scored in the club's 3-1 defeat of Manchester United in the 1994 League Cup final, tweeted: ""RIP Dalian Atkinson. You'll never be forgotten!""

Villa legend Paul McGrath also tweeted his reaction, describing his former team-mate as a ""huge part of the Villa family"", while former Villa winger Tony Daley described it as ""devastating news"".

Former manager at Villa and Sheffield Wednesday Ron Atkinson said: ""He was popular in the dressing room, had terrific ability and did it in the big games.""

West Midlands Ambulance Service crews called by West Mercia Police arrived to find a man had been Tasered.

""As he was being conveyed to Princess Royal Hospital, his condition deteriorated and he went into cardiac arrest,"" a spokesman said.

""Despite the efforts of the crew and hospital staff, it was not possible to save him and he was confirmed dead at hospital, shortly after arrival.""

Neighbours Tina and Matthew Bothwell told BBC News their son had heard ""a bang and shouting"" outside on Sunday night but thought nothing of it.

""We woke up just before seven, and saw all the police outside and police just said it's all cordoned off,"" Mr Bothwell said.

Ms Bothwell said they had been told ""someone had been Tasered and passed away"".

Mr Bothwell, 43, said the former striker was a popular visitor to the neighbourhood.

He said: ""Every time he would come he would have crowds around him. It's a close-knit community.

""I just can't bear to think what his family are going through.""

In a statement, the IPCC said ""a full and thorough investigation"" was taking place.

""At this stage the IPCC is aware a Taser was used on the man before he became ill,"" it said.

The IPCC also said that since releasing its Taser report covering 2004-2013, it was aware of two inquest verdicts that have found police use of Taser played a significant or material part in a death.

It added that it was already investigating four deaths before which a Taser was discharged.

Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Mercia force John Campion said his thoughts were with the former footballer's family.

He added: ""It is an important part of my role to hold the police to account.

""I want to be absolutely clear and reassure our communities that I will be doing that fairly and proportionately with regard to this incident once the full facts are available.""",6014
728013148788154368,unverified,Report: Caitlyn Jenner will pose nude for Sports Illustrated https://t.co/npOWQdrQHo https://t.co/ZmC64PUot8,http://bit.ly/26V2WQW,True,Report: Caitlyn Jenner will pose nude for Sports Illustrated,"- Caitlyn Jenner will reportedly pose nude on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

According to a US Weekly source, the 66-year-old will be featured on the cover of SI wearing only an American flag and her gold medal.

Jenner became ""the world’s greatest athlete"" after winning gold at Montreal Summer Olympics in 1976.

Jenner’s spokesperson told The Huffington Post that there was ""no comment on any future plans at this time.""

Since coming out a year ago, Caitlyn Jenner has not always been a unifying force in the transgender community. Her latest political remarks — underscoring her conservative outlook and praising Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz — ignited a storm of criticism from supporters of transgender rights, who view most conservative Republicans as adversaries.

""Breathtakingly clueless"" was the rebuke from blogger Monica Roberts. Tennis great Martina Navratilova and country singer Chely Wright were also among the many people denouncing Jenner.

Yet a more nuanced conversation followed, questioning whether transgender Americans must be monolithic in broadly espousing progressive politics, or whether they can make room for differing views in their ranks.

Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said she is grateful there are transgender Republicans and would like to see the issue of transgender rights addressed on a nonpartisan basis. She also said it is inevitable that the ranks of transgender Americans would grow more diverse.

""Trans people need to buckle up,"" she said. ""With all the folks who will be coming out in the next few years, you're not going to agree with all of them.""

While Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have voiced strong support for LGBT rights, Cruz and the other Republican contenders have expressed misgivings about same-sex marriage and supported protections for people who oppose it on religious grounds.

Among those wrestling with the fallout of Jenner's remarks is Jennifer Finney Boylan, a writer and professor at Barnard College. She is a consultant and cast member on Jenner's reality show, ""I am Cait.""

In one episode, Boylan — who has described Cruz as a bigot — became so aggravated with Jenner's political views that she swatted her with a rolled-up newspaper.

""In terms of equality and dignity, the difference between Republicans and Democrats is night and day,"" Boylan said in an interview. ""I don't really get why you'd vote against your own civil rights.""

Yet Boylan remains engaged in the TV series and considers Jenner a friend.

""How is it possible to communicate with people whom we want to smack with a newspaper?"" Boylan asked in recent blog post. ""The question, for me, is not, will Cait become a liberal? There is no operation for that, alas. But she CAN become someone who listens, who opens her heart, who has compassion. And so can I.""

Jenner sparked the furor with comments in a March 2 article in The Advocate, an LGBT-oriented magazine.

""I like Ted Cruz,"" Jenner declared, even while describing the Texas senator as ""one of the worst ones"" in regard to transgender rights.

""The Democrats are better when it comes to these types of social issues. I understand that,"" Jenner told The Advocate. ""So why support Republicans? Number 1, if we don't have a country, we don't have trans issues. We need jobs. We need a vibrant economy.""

Jenner suggested lightheartedly that if Cruz is elected president, she could become his ""trans ambassador"" and seek to sway him on transgender issues.

Jay Michaelson, a rabbi, author and gay activist, urged Jenner to backtrack.

""I'm begging you to do so,"" he wrote in The Daily Beast. ""The Republicans' promised actions — especially those of Ted Cruz — would be absolutely devastating to us, and even to you personally.""

Transgender activist Dana Beyer, executive director of Gender Rights Maryland, said it should not be surprising that the former Olympic decathlon champion retained long-held political views.

""We're probably better off if she remains a Republican,"" Beyer said. ""The Republicans for the most part won't talk to us, and we're not going to make progress unless we persuade some of them. We need access.""

Dru Levasseur, Transgender Rights Project director of the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal, said it would be useful if transgender-specific issues were raised in the GOP debates. He said he'd like to learn where the Republicans stand in the heated debate over transgender people's access to public restrooms.

According to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which supports LGBT political candidates, there are no transgender Republicans currently serving in elective office in the U.S.

U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, has a transgender son, and has cited that as a reason why she's more supportive of LGBT rights than most of her GOP colleagues in Congress.

In 2010, a transgender woman, Donna Milo, unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for a congressional seat in Florida.

Being transgender ""doesn't define my values, my goals, my political ambitions, my conservative positions,"" she told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper during the campaign. ""Just because you are somewhat socially open-minded doesn't mean that you're not fiscally conservative, a strong Christian, and believe in a strong foreign policy.""

In St. Paul, Minnesota, Susan Kimberly pursued a long, bipartisan political career after going public with a decision to transition from man to woman in 1984. She served as deputy mayor under Republican Mayor Norm Coleman.

Kimberly, 73 and retired, says she became a Republican while serving with Coleman and remains one today. She's not enamored of Republican positions on LGBT rights, but believes the GOP best represents some of her core values — including self-responsibility and limited government.

""It's really hard to be a Republican, but it remains impossible for me to be a Democrat,"" she said.",5959

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first militant was executed for “banditry and robbing Muslims’ money”. The second militant was allegedly killed for “dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen”.

The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.

There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.

Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising. He told The Independent: “Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement.

The Fast and Furious series star, who really made a name for himself in the late ’90s with movies like Varsity Blues and She’s All That, died Saturday afternoon in a car accident at age 40, and online reaction poured in from his acting friends and peers.

Read below for tributes to the late actor, including from Fast co-star Ludacris, Sarah Michelle Gellar (whose husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., starred alongside Walker in She’s All That), and past co-workers Matthew Lillard and Tyson Beckford.

691809004356501505,non-rumor,"""America is a nation of second chances"" —@POTUS on new reforms to solitary confinement: https://t.co/0G7tIBFkeh https://t.co/c7yZWsUG4c",http://wpo.st/PKP61,True,Barack Obama: Why we must rethink solitary confinement,"Barack Obama is president of the United States.

In 2010, a 16-year-old named Kalief Browder from the Bronx was accused of stealing a backpack. He was sent to Rikers Island to await trial, where he reportedly endured unspeakable violence at the hands of inmates and guards — and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement.

In 2013, Kalief was released, having never stood trial. He completed a successful semester at Bronx Community College. But life was a constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day. One Saturday, he committed suicide at home. He was just 22 years old.

Solitary confinement gained popularity in the United States in the early 1800s, and the rationale for its use has varied over time. Today, it’s increasingly overused on people such as Kalief, with heartbreaking results — which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem.

There are as many as 100,000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons — including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25,000 inmates are serving months, even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell, with almost no human contact.

In a speech to members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in July 2015 where he called for criminal justice reform, President Obama said that solitary confinement ""is not going to make us safer."" (YouTube/The White House)

Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.

The United States is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. Those who do make it out often have trouble holding down jobs, reuniting with family and becoming productive members of society. Imagine having served your time and then being unable to hand change over to a customer or look your wife in the eye or hug your children.

As president, my most important job is to keep the American people safe. And since I took office, overall crime rates have decreased by more than 15 percent. In our criminal justice system, the punishment should fit the crime — and those who have served their time should leave prison ready to become productive members of society. How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesn’t make us safer. It’s an affront to our common humanity.

That’s why last summer, I directed Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the Justice Department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across U.S. prisons. They found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool, such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates. In those cases, the practice should be limited, applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort. They have identified common-sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system.

The Justice Department has completed its review, and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions, expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10,000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement — and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.

[More coverage: Obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons]

States that have led the way are already seeing positive results. Colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement, and assaults against staff are the lowest they’ve been since 2006. New Mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement, with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs. And since 2012, federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff.

Reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform. Every year, we spend $80 billion to keep 2.2 million people incarcerated. Many criminals belong behind bars. But too many others, especially nonviolent drug offenders, are serving unnecessarily long sentences. That’s why members of Congress in both parties are pushing for change, from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities. And I hope they will send me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter, fairer, less expensive and more effective.

In America, we believe in redemption. We believe, in the words of Pope Francis, that “every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.” We believe that when people make mistakes, they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives. And if we can give them the hope of a better future, and a way to get back on their feet, then we will leave our children with a country that is safer, stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.",5921

387353560356118528,false,A claim that #Obama used the #shutdown to scuttle the Amber Alert system reveals an ignorance about Amber Alerts. http://t.co/Y0KDRHC0wy,http://bit.ly/19atfTD,True,Tweets and bloggers say Obama used government shutdown to close Amber Alert system,"The Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program because of the government shutdown.

The government shutdown has cranked up the volume on the blame game of who is causing the most misery for whom. The latest move comes from the right, where accusations began to fly that President Barack Obama was willing to put missing children’s lives at risk to score political points.

From what we found, the claim started in the Twitterverse with tweets late on Friday night , Oct. 4, 2013. ""Did u see how the amber alert system was shut down & they even produced a screen to declare it!?"" said one. Amber Alert is the system that draws the public into the hunt for an abducted child.

The Right Scoop carried the message to a wider audience. At around 5 p.m. Sunday, it posted that the U.S. Justice Department Web page for the Amber Alert program was down. ""I’m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn’t – at least not while he’s trying to ‘win’ the government shutdown,"" the blog post said.

The Drudge Report put that item on its homepage with the headline, ""Amber Alert website shut down, Michelle’s ‘Let’s Move’ stays up."" By the next morning, the Washington Examiner’s Mark Tapscott had an article titled, "" Obama shutters Amber Alerts as government shutdown enters second week.""

""Somebody, somewhere in the Obama White House or the Obama Justice Department decided to shut down the Amber Alerts, despite the system's long and stellar record of helping locate missing children,"" Tapscott wrote.

Two congressmen, Stephen Fincher , R-Tenn, and Steve Stockman , R-Texas, added their own tweets into the mix, echoing the theme that Obama was playing politics with kids.

By mid-morning Monday, the government Web page was back up, but chastising tweets continued. We decided to check out exactly what had been shut down, and by whom.

Federal action

If you went to the federal Amber Alert Web page on Sunday, you would have found this message ""Due to the lapse in Federal funding, this Office of Justice Program website is unavailable."" That is what triggered the blog postings, tweets and articles.

A Justice Department spokesperson explained to the Huffington Post , ""All the sites that had to go offline were put behind a firewall so that they couldn't be hacked while the IT people were on furlough.""

The spokesman said a furloughed worker was brought back Monday to put the site back online.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave the reason for that move at his press briefing later that day. ""To eliminate any confusion among the public about the status of the program. A furloughed Justice Department employee was called in to work in order to restore the informational site,"" Carney said. ""But again, it’s informational. The system itself was never interrupted.""

We contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , a private nonprofit that assists local and state authorities in this work. According to their data, over this weekend, at the same time the tweets and blog posts were building, the Amber Alert was activated twice: in Texas on Oct. 4 and in Florida on Oct. 5.

At the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, spokesperson Gretl Plessinger said the news stories about the federal website had prompted some people to call out of concern. Plessinger reassured the public that Florida's program ""is operating as it always has.""

We also got in touch with Gene Thaxton of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, who coordinates the Amber Alert system for that state. Thaxton was emphatic that the program never closed.

""Oklahoma has its own Amber Alert program, and it is not affected by the government shutdown,"" he said. ""The federal Web page is informational. It doesn’t affect the operations of the program.""

To be clear, the Amber Alert system is not run by Washington. States set up their own programs and use guidelines and standards that are shared nationwide. The program is a network of these state-run operations.

At the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, spokesman Bob Hoever told us that the federal Web page plays no role in actually finding children.

Hoever said local or state law enforcement officials trigger an Amber Alert when authorities have details like the name of the child, a photo of the child, the kind of car involved, a plate number, or a photo of the suspect. ""Those are the things that have led to a rescue in the past,"" he said.

State authorities then notify the media and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The center spreads the word through the Web and over cell phones, sending automatic text messages to everyone with a smart phone in the area where officials think the child might be.

""We had a case in Minnesota where a teenager read the text on her phone, and there across the street was the car,"" Hoever said. ""She told her dad, and he called the police, and they rescued the child.""

Hoever said as far as he knows, from the initial investigation to the public reports of a possible sighting, the federal website has never been involved.

""If people knew how this worked, we wouldn’t be dealing with this confusion,"" he said.

Our ruling

People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida.

The one sliver of truth that triggered this claim is that a federal webpage promoting the program was closed, but that did not affect the program itself. It is a mistake to confuse that web page with the Amber Alert system.

We rate the statement False.",5846

Burkina Faso's government says 28 people were killed and a further 56 injured after Islamist militants attacked a hotel in the capital, Ouagadougou, popular with foreigners.

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has said it carried out the attack, which began on Friday night.

Six of those killed were from Canada, the country's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.

Burkina Faso is to observe 72 hours of national mourning for the victims.

The siege at the Splendid Hotel was declared over after a joint operation by local and French security forces.

At least four attackers died in the assaults. There were claims that some of those involved were women.

As well as the luxury hotel, a cafe and another hotel nearby were targeted.

Burkinabe Security Minister Simon Compoare said 176 hostages had been rescued. The bodies of three ""very young"" attackers had been found, he said.

Among those known to have died are:

Six Canadian nationals - PM Justin Trudeau condemned what he called ""these senseless acts of violence on innocent civilians""

Five Burkinabe citizens

Two French nationals, with one more injured, according to France's government

Two Swiss citizens who had been in the cafe which came under attack

One 67-year-old Dutch volunteer, according to the Dutch foreign ministry

An American missionary, Mike Riddering, whose death was announced by his wife Amy on Facebook and later confirmed by the State Department

In another development, the Burkina Faso government said a foreign doctor and his wife were kidnapped on Friday night in the north of the country, near the border with Mali. There was initial confusion over the pair's nationality - the Burkinabe government said they were Austrian, but later corrected this to Australian.

In November, an AQIM attack on a hotel in Bamako, capital of neighbouring Mali, left 19 people dead.

At the scene: Thomas Fessy, BBC News

The area surrounding the Splendid Hotel has been cordoned off. Soldiers can still be seen walking in and out of the building but the siege is now over.

At least three cars parked right outside the front door are completely charred, the remains of another two sit just across the street. Two burnt motorbikes lie in the middle.

The light purple colour of the Splendid Hotel's front side now looks black, probably caused by the smoke generated by explosions.

The Yibi hotel, opposite the Splendid, also shows signs of the attack, and the authorities say at least one attacker was killed inside the building.

Militants attacked the Splendid and the nearby Cappuccino cafe on Friday evening, setting off several explosions. Both places are popular with UN staff and foreigners.

Survivors described how the militants went from person to person, touching their bodies to see if they moved.

""They started shooting, shooting, and everybody lay down on the ground,"" said Mariette, who escaped from the hotel with her younger sister.

""As soon as you lifted your head they would shoot straightaway, so you had to pretend to be dead. And they even came to touch our feet to check if we were alive. As soon as you were alive, they would shoot at you.""

Background: Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb grew from a remnant of a defunct rebel force, rooted in Algeria's civil war in the 1990s, into a wealthy and feared militant group that made its money from kidnapping Westerners and trafficking arms and drugs.

In 2007 it announced it had joined the al-Qaeda network to fight against Western interests. Later though, some of its members left to form their own factions. The most notable of these was Mokhtar Belmokhtar who was behind the 2013 siege of a gas plant in Algeria.

In November 2015 Belmokhtar's faction said it had worked with its parent group to attack a hotel in Mali. That signalled the mending of relations between some of the factions to rebuild the original AQIM, which was being overshadowed by its rival, the so-called Islamic State.

This latest attack in Burkina Faso would seem to be an attempt by AQIM not just to reinforce itself as the main jihadist group in the region, but also to show that it can spread its violent campaign to new frontiers.

As the end of the siege at the Splendid was being announced, reports came in that militants had taken up position at the Yibi hotel, a short distance away. One attacker was killed at the Yibi, officials said later.

Remi Dandjinou, the Burkinabe communications minister, told the BBC earlier that between six and seven militants had attacked the Splendid, adding that they had been staying at the hotel as guests.

Mr Compaore said two black Africans and an Arab were among the militants killed.

691380138710306816,non-rumor,Pentagon Holds Gala To Celebrate 25 Years Of Bombing Iraq https://t.co/kYzkswR1Eg https://t.co/CV8VgrbVYN,http://onion.com/1nHr1Zg,True,Pentagon Holds Gala To Celebrate 25 Years Of Bombing Iraq,"WASHINGTON—Bringing together the many civilian leaders and military strategists who helped them reach such a historic milestone, Pentagon officials held a lavish black-tie gala Sunday at which, sources said, they commemorated 25 years of the United States bombing Iraq.

Hundreds of active-duty and retired military officers, high-ranking members of the past four presidential administrations, and executives from top defense contractors reportedly gathered in the grand ballroom of D.C.’s Fairmont Hotel to dine, mingle, and celebrate a quarter century spent routinely dropping thousands of tons of explosive ordnance across the Middle Eastern nation—from the Jan. 17, 1991 onset of airstrikes in the Gulf War to the current bombardment of suspected ISIS targets.

“I’ll never forget that morning 25 years ago when our first strike force of stealth bombers flew in and just unloaded on Baghdad,” said the evening’s keynote speaker, Dick Cheney, who served as defense secretary during the Gulf War, vice president during the Iraq War, and, in the intervening years, CEO of the oil field services company Halliburton. “And then we started letting them have it with our Tomahawk cruise missiles, too. If you’d told me back then we’d still be pounding some of those very same targets today, I wouldn’t have believed you.”

“But hundreds of thousands of bombs later, here we are!” Cheney added to thunderous applause. “And it’s all thanks to the dedication and resolve of the people in this room.”

Leading the gala’s impressive guest list were Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who according to reports spent much of the evening exchanging stories—some old, some new—of their respective experiences demolishing Fallujah, Mosul, Anbar Province, the Sunni Triangle, and countless other locations. The former commanders-in-chief reportedly shared the head table with a delegation from the neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century and members of the Saudi royal family, whom Cheney praised as “staunch allies through this whole thing.”

Also present were Iraq War architects Condoleezza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Doug Feith, and Richard Perle, who admitted to reporters they felt overwhelmed by nostalgia throughout the event as they reconnected with old faces and shared laughs over the discredited intelligence that served as the basis for military action. Reportedly seated nearby were journalists Judith Miller and Bill Keller, who received a special commendation for their work covering the run-up to the 2003 invasion for The New York Times, drawing one of the largest standing ovations of the night.

Representatives from Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrup Grumman, and other weapons manufacturers were honored as well, and thanked for donating the gala’s elaborate ice sculptures that depicted a vintage Raytheon-designed Patriot missile from Operation Desert Storm, a 2003-era cluster bomb now banned by most countries, and a modern MQ-9 Reaper UAV armed with Hellfire missiles and 500-pound munitions.

“This is a truly magnificent night—I just wish Gen. [Norman] Schwarzkopf were here to see it,” said retired Gen. Raymond T. Odierno during a portion of the evening’s ceremonies that paid tribute to all the commanders of U.S. forces in Iraq over the years. “Twenty-five years ago, I was only a major, still in my 30s, and I really looked up to that guy. I never thought I’d get a chance to do what he did, but a couple decades later, there I was, ordering some of the very same bombing runs that he had. I modeled my entire career after his and feel privileged to have followed so closely in his footsteps.”

“It’s especially important that we take a moment tonight to honor our legacy in Iraq so that today’s troops can fully appreciate the rich history of our military campaigns there,” continued Odierno, “as most of them weren’t born yet when we started bombing the place.”

According to attendees, the gala featured an elaborate multimedia presentation titled A Generation Of Commitment, which began with a montage of night-vision targeting footage from Desert Storm interspersed with reports from up-and-coming CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer. A segment called “The Clinton Years: A Retrospective” showed F-16 fighter jets enforcing no-fly zones, and then rolled highlights from Operation Desert Fox while Outkast’s 2000 recording “B.O.B (Bombs Over Baghdad)” played in the background.

The presentation’s survey of Operation Iraqi Freedom included video of then–Secretary of State Colin Powell assuring the U.N. that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, a May 2003 clip of a flight suit–clad George W. Bush landing on an aircraft carrier adorned with a “Mission Accomplished” banner, and a July 2003 clip of Bush saying “Bring ’em on” in response to questions about the rapidly growing Iraqi insurgency.

The final segment, “Drones: The Game-Changer,” showed images taken just last week of airmen in a small computer room in Nevada bombing Iraq using joysticks and real-time video feeds.

“Sure, we’ve been through some hard times, especially those dark days in 2012 and 2013 when we pretty much stopped bombing Iraq entirely,” former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in his closing remarks to the group, raising a glass of champagne as the room followed suit. “But we started right up again, like we always do, and we’ve seen thousands of new airstrikes since. Our enemy may change, but from Saddam to the Islamic State—and through all the I-don’t-know-how-many insurgencies in between—our mission has remained the same. We’ve stayed true to our roots and kept the tradition of bombing Iraq alive.”

Added Rumsfeld, “Here’s to 25 more years!”",5783

Its legs can reach up to one foot (30 centimeters) and it can weight up to 6 oz. (170 grams).

Piotr Naskrecki was taking a nighttime walk in a rainforest in Guyana, when he heard rustling as if something were creeping underfoot. When he turned on his flashlight, he expected to see a small mammal, such as a possum or a rat.

""When I turned on the light, I couldn't quite understand what I was seeing,"" said Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology.

A moment later, he realized he was looking not at a brown, furry mammal, but an enormous, puppy-size spider.

Known as the South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), the colossal arachnid is the world's largest spider, according to Guinness World Records. Its leg span can reach up to a foot (30 centimeters), or about the size of ""a child's forearm,"" with a body the size of ""a large fist,"" Naskrecki told Live Science. And the spider can weigh more than 6 oz. (170 grams) — about as much as a young puppy, the scientist wrote on his blog. [See Photos of the Goliath Birdeater Spider]

Some sources say the giant huntsman spider, which has a larger leg span, is bigger than the birdeater. But the huntsman is much more delicate than the hefty birdeater — comparing the two would be ""like comparing a giraffe to an elephant,"" Naskrecki said.

The birdeater's enormous size is evident from the sounds it makes. ""Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse's hooves hitting the ground,"" he wrote, but ""not as loud.""

Prickly hairs and 3/4-inch fangs

When Naskrecki approached the imposing creature in the rainforest, it would rub its hind legs against its abdomen. At first, the scientist thought the behavior was ""cute,"" he said, but then he realized the spider was sending out a cloud of hairs with microscopic barbs on them. When these hairs get in the eyes or other mucous membranes, they are ""extremely painful and itchy,"" and can stay there for days, he said. [Creepy-Crawly Gallery: See Spooky Photos of Spiders]

But its prickly hairs aren't the birdeater's only line of defense; it also sports a pair of 0.79-inch-long (2 centimeters) fangs, which can sometimes reach up to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Although the spider's bite is venomous, it's not deadly to humans. But it would still be extremely painful, ""like driving a nail through your hand,"" Naskrecki said.

And the eight-legged beast has a third defense mechanism up its hairy sleeve. The hairs on the front of the spider's body have tiny hooks and barbs that make a hissing sound when they rub against each other, ""sort of like pulling Velcro apart,"" Naskrecki said.

Yet despite all that, the spider doesn't pose a threat to humans. Even if it bites you, ""a chicken can probably do more damage,"" Naskrecki said.

Bird eater or mostly harmless?

Despite its name, the birdeater doesn't usually eat birds, although it is certainly capable of killing small mammals. ""They will essentially attack anything that they encounter,"" Naskrecki said.

The spider hunts in leaf litter on the ground at night, so the chances of it encountering a bird are very small, he said. However, if it found a nest, it could easily kill the parents and the chicks, he said, adding that the spider species has also been known to puncture and drink bird eggs.

The spider will eat frogs and insects, but its main prey is actually earthworms, which come out at night when it's humid. ""Earthworms are very nutritious,"" Naskrecki said.

Birdeaters are not endangered, but they are shy. ""I've been working in the tropics in South America for many, many years, and in the last 10 to 15 years, I only ran across the spider three times,"" Naskrecki.

After catching the specimen he found in Guyana, which was female, Naskrecki took her back to his lab to study. She's now deposited in a museum.

Update: Oct. 21

In response to a flood of questions about what happened to the spider and why it was killed, Naskrecki wrote another post on his blog. In it, he explains that the animal was euthanized, preserved, carefully labeled, and deposited in a collection at the University of Guyana, ""where to this day it serves as an important teaching tool.""

Collection and preservation of physical specimens ""is an integral, irreplaceable element of biological sciences,"" Naskrecki wrote. He added that the Goliath birdeater is ""a very common species, not protected or endangered, and collecting of a single individual poses absolutely no threat to its survival."" In fact, you can buy the spiders in pet stores and online.

""There is absolutely no evidence that any scientist has ever driven a species to extinction,"" Naskrecki said. Rather, species go extinct due to the destruction of their habitat or competition from alien species introduced by humans, he said. ""And this loss of species is happening on an unimaginable scale — by some estimates 16,000 species quietly go extinct every year, some even before scientists have a chance to describe and name them,"" he said.

Editor's Note: This article was last updated at 3:26 p.m. ET on Oct. 21 to include more information about what happened to the spider. Also, the article originally incorrectly stated the length of the fangs as 2 inches; in fact, their maximum length is 1.5 inches.

Police in Brazil investigating illegal Olympic ticket sales have arrested the head of the European Olympic Committees, Irishman Patrick Hickey.

Mr Hickey, 71, is suspected of being involved in a scheme to sell tickets for higher than their face value.

He was taken to hospital as a precaution, and will probably stay the night there, police said.

The Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) said he had stood down temporarily from his roles after being arrested.

Brazilian police said that when officers went to Mr Hickey's hotel room on Wednesday morning, they found his wife there with his Olympic credentials.

Mrs Hickey told them her husband had left Rio de Janeiro for Ireland at the weekend, they said.

With the help of the hotel they began a search and found Mr Hickey in the room next door, they added.

While police said they had reason to believe he was trying to escape, a video apparently of the arrest on the ESPN Brazil sports news website shows Mr Hickey answering the door naked to officers.

Police said the arrest was related to that of fellow Irishman Kevin James Mallon on the day of the Olympic opening ceremony.

More than 700 tickets organised in envelopes clearly marked for sale were found in a safe with Mr Mallon, Detective Ricardo Barbosa told the BBC.

Police estimate the potential profits of the alleged scheme at 10m reals (£2.4m; $3.1m).

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would co-operate with any police investigation.

Irish broadcaster RTE reports that Mr Hickey faces three potential charges: facilitating ticket touting, forming a cartel, and ""ambush"" or illicit marketing.

In an interview with RTE last week, Mr Hickey denied any wrongdoing in relation to ticket sales.

A spokesman for Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the BBC: ""We are aware of an Irish citizen having been arrested in Rio. The department, through its consulate in Rio, is following up and stands ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance.""

Sports minister Shane Ross, who is in Rio and who met Mr Hickey at the weekend to discuss the ticket sales allegations, tweeted simply: ""Shell shock here in Rio.""

He later said he was returning to Dublin as quickly as possible for crisis talks.

Mr Hickey is president of the European Olympic Committees, the body which gathers the continent's 50 national Olympic committees together.

His passport and Olympic ID were seized and were later displayed to photographers at the press conference.

His arrest is the biggest move yet by police investigating the selling of tickets on the black market.

Mr Mallon is the director of THG Sports, a British sports hospitality company alleged to have resold tickets for Rio 2016 illegally.

Police suspect the tickets found with him when he was arrested on 5 August were to be sold at prices of up to £6,000 ($7,800) each.

THG Sports said Mr Mallon had not sold or sought to sell tickets but had been holding them for collection by clients of the authorised Irish ticket reseller, Pro 10 Management.

But Detective Barbosa told the BBC that investigators believed ""Pro 10 was created as a means for acquiring tickets to be resold by THG"" as the Irish Olympic Committee had wanted THG to sell tickets for Rio 2016, he alleged.

THG Sports is owned by Marcus Evans Group, which also owns Ipswich Town Football Club.

Marcus Evans was one of four names on a list of arrest warrants issued by a Brazilian judge on Monday in connection with the alleged reselling of Rio 2016 tickets.

None of those four people is thought to be in Brazil and police there have said they will pursue the matter with Interpol.

A further three arrest warrants were issued on Wednesday, Brazilian police said, for directors of Pro 10 Management.

The OCI has said it will launch an inquiry into the ticket sale controversy but has been criticised for rejecting a call by the Irish sports minister to bring in independent investigators.

Last week, the OCI wrote on its website there was ""absolutely no suggestion of misconduct or impropriety"" by the OCI or any of its staff.",5763

The Fukushima disaster is likely to get far worse, if you can believe that

(NaturalNews) Japan's nuclear watchdog has now declared the leak of radioactive water from Fukushima a ""state of emergency."" Each day, 300 tons of radioactive water seeps into the ocean, and it's now clear that TEPCO has engage in a two-and-a-half-year cover-up of immense magnitude.""I believe it's been leaking into the ocean from the start of the crisis two-and-a-half years ago,"" disclosed a 12-year TEPCO veteran named""There are still reactor buildings we haven't gotten into yet,"" said another worker named Fujimoto-san. ""So there's always the possibility of another explosion...""Just how out of control is the situation at Fukushima? It's so out of control that TEPCO recently had to admit 10 of its workers were somehow -- yeah, see if you can figure this out --while waiting for a bus.""The workers' exposure above the neck was found to be as much as 10 becquerels per square centimeter,"" reports Bloomberg.com How exactly did highly radioactive water manage to find its way to a bus stop in the first place? TEPCO isn't sure. It's confusing with all those radiation alarms going off all the time. In order to concentrate, the company has found it's easier to just disable all the alarms and pretend nothing's wrong.To fully grasp the extent of the TEPCO denial, realize that only recently did the company finally admit that radioactive groundwater has been leaking into the ocean. This follows years of stark denials from the company, whose executes have exhibited a remarkable ability to deny reality even when their own workers are dying in droves from cancer.It's no exaggeration to say that TEPCO's downplaying of the full extent of the Fukushima disaster has-- people who should have been warned about radiation but were denied that information due to the TEPCO cover-up.""At this current time in July of 2013, Fukushima is 80 to 100x more expansive and more intense -- letting out about 100x more of the radiation of Chernobyl,"" reports Dr. Simon Atkins Phoenix Rising Radio on a BlogTalkRadio interview ""The problem with Fukushima is that it's not only continuing for 865 days... I mean, let's wrap our minds around that for a second -- it has been leaking out radiation in increasing volumes for 865 days.""Why has TEPCO been able to cover up the truth about Fukushima for so long? Because Japan is a. The idea of keeping your head down and not ""rocking the boat"" is deeply embedded in Japanese culture.Japan is not a nation of ""rugged individualism"" but of conformist acquiescence.As a result, whistleblowers are shunned, and there is immense peer pressure to defend the status quo... even when it's a terrible lie. This culture of conformity at all costs is precisely what allows companies like TEPCO to continue operating extremely dangerous nuclear power plants with virtually no accountability.While Japan has entire museums dedicated to the horrifying history of two Japanese cities being bombed by the United States at the end of World War II, when Japan's own power company is involved in a radiological disaster of similar magnitude, the entire incident gets swept under the rug. Radiation? What radiation? If the government says there's no radiation, thenAfter all, it's invisible!The U.S. government, of course, plays along with the charade because its own top weapons manufacturer -- General Electric -- designed and built the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in the first place. And the design decisions made by GE, such as storing spent fuel rods in large pools high above the ground, now look not just incompetent but downright idiotic. It turns out. The idea was to just let them build up over time until someone else inherited the problem.So while Japan and the USA play this game of ""let's all pretend nothing happened,"" citizens of both countries continue to be exposed to a relentless wave of deadly radiation that now dwarfs the total radiation release of Chernobyl (which the U.S. media played up in a huge way because the disaster made the Russians look incompetent).The only reason TEPCO is finally getting around to admitting the truth in all this is becauseforever. Radiation follows the laws of physics and atomic decay, not the whims of lying politicians and bureaucrats. As a result, the real story eventually comes out as we're starting to see right now.The upshot is that the Fukushima disaster is not only far worse than you've been told; it's very likely. The radiation leak isn't plugged, in other words, and another explosion -- which many experts believe might be imminent -- would release thousands of times more nuclear material into the open environment.Ultimately, the entire Northern hemisphere has been placed at risk by a bunch of corporate bureaucrats who thought building a nuclear facility in the path of a sure-to-happen tidal wave was a fantastic idea. Instead of acknowledging the problem and working to fix it like a responsible person would, our world's top politicians and ass-coverers have decided it is in their best short-term interests to play along with the TEPCO fairy tale which ridiculously pretends that radioactive leaks can be controlled by wishful thinking.Remember: Governments can lie about the national debt, health care costs, inflation and unemployment, but they cannot lie about radiation for very long.

543443188934250496,false,"""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,"" Pope Francis said to a boy whose dog died http://t.co/pzMrdD7ZzA",http://nyti.ms/1qErSu7,True,Dogs in Heaven? Pope Francis Leaves Pearly Gates Open,"Charles Camosy, an author and professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke “in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics.” But asked whether the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Mr. Camosy said, “In a word: absolutely.”

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church. He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues like homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples. So to some extent, it was not a surprise that Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, would suggest that they have a place in heaven.

In his remarks, as reported by Vatican Radio, Francis said of paradise: “It’s lovely to think of this, to think we will find ourselves up there. All of us in heaven. It’s good, it gives strength to our soul.

“At the same time, the Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us, and that came out of the thought and the heart of God.”

Theologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America, the Catholic magazine, said he believed that Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation,” even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Pius IX, who led the church from 1846 to 1878, longer than any other pope, strongly supported the doctrine that dogs and other animals have no consciousness. He even sought to thwart the founding of an Italian chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Pope John Paul II appeared to reverse Pius in 1990 when he proclaimed that animals do have souls and are “as near to God as men are.” But the Vatican did not widely publicize his assertion, perhaps because it so directly contradicted Pius, who was the first to declare the doctrine of papal infallibility in 1854.

John Paul’s successor, Benedict, seemed to emphatically reject his view in a 2008 sermon in which he asserted that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth.”

Ms. Gutleben of the Humane Society said Francis’ apparent reversal of Benedict’s view could be enormous. “If the pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul,” she said. “And if that’s true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them. We have to admit that these are sentient beings, and they mean something to God.”

Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the pope’s remarks vindicated the biblical portrayal of heaven as peaceful and loving, and could influence eating habits, moving Catholics away from consuming meat — which she asserted had already been happening anyway. “It’s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,” she said. “I’m not a Catholic historian, but PETA’s motto is that animals aren’t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren’t ours, they’re God’s.”

Whether the pope’s remarks will prove to be a persuasive new reason not to eat meat, a potentially worrisome development to the multibillion-dollar beef, pork, poultry and seafood industries, remains unclear at best. But they did cause discussion.

“As on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,” Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email. “They certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.” Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given “dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.”

“While that ‘dominion’ means use for human benefit, it also requires stewardship — humane care and feeding — something all farmers who raise animals practice every day of every year,” Mr. Warner said.

Father Martin said he did not believe the pope’s remarks could be construed as a comment on vegetarianism. But, he said, “he’s reminding us that all creation is holy and that in his mind, paradise is open to all creatures, and frankly, I agree with him.”

Laura Hobgood-Oster, professor of religion and environmental studies at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., and an expert on the history of dog-human interaction, said she believed that there would be a backlash from religious conservatives, but that it would take time.

“The Catholic Church has never been clear on this question; it’s all over the place, because it begs so many other questions,” she said. “Where do mosquitoes go, for God’s sake?”",5607

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is endorsing Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primary, Perry told POLITICO in an interview Sunday night.

Perry, who also sought the GOP nomination before dropping out in September, said he now sees the race as one that is between Cruz, a fellow Texan, and Donald Trump. Through phone calls and during a December day spent driving around his Round Top, Texas, home in his truck with Cruz, Perry said he found the senator to be a good listener who respects the Tenth Amendment, “knows what he does not know” and is more conservative than Trump.

Story Continued Below

“Of those individuals who have a chance to win the Republican primary, at this juncture, from my perspective, Ted Cruz is by far the most consistent conservative in that crowd,” Perry said. “And that appears to be down to two people.""

Perry, who is famously skilled at retail politics, will campaign with Cruz Tuesday across Iowa, and will join Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King to stump for Cruz again Wednesday. Perry and King will both join Cruz at a Des Moines rally Wednesday night.

The endorsement gives Cruz the blessing of the longest-serving governor in Texas history, just as the senator faces intensifying heat from other veteran politicians, including from his colleagues in Washington, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.

Perry, recalling his own experience vetoing a long list of bills early in his gubernatorial tenure, said his actions resulted in others viewing him as a “man of principle,” and insisted that Cruz would similarly be able to get things done as president, despite his current reputation among fellow senators for being a bomb-thrower.

“You’ll have with Ted Cruz that same result of, senators and others in the Washington establishment that are mad at him, find him to be hard to work with, they will find a way to work with him because they know he means what he says he means,” he said.

Perry has been dismissive in the past of the experience of first-term senators compared to governors. But he said Sunday that he has come to realize the GOP electorate doesn’t value executive experience this cycle in the same way he does.

“Gov. Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, Jeb’s barely making an impact out there — those are very skilled, very successful, very experienced governors,” Perry said. “But the electorate doesn’t want that. That’s why we have elections, why we democratically select leaders.”

And he is confident, he said, that Cruz would be prepared.

“He knows he’s going to surround himself with people who do have that experience, and I’m very satisfied that on Day 1, he will be ready to be commander-in-chief,” Perry said, “Partly because of the time he’s going to spend in learning what he doesn’t know, but he’s also surrounding himself with people who are extraordinarily capable and wise.”

Perry’s endorsement was hardly a sure bet. The two were on opposite sides of the 2012 Senate primary race, when Cruz ran successfully against Perry’s then-lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst, in a contest that launched Cruz on the national stage. In his farewell address before the Republican-dominated state legislature last year, Perry warned against those who would place “purity ahead of unity” — a frequent criticism of Cruz's style. And Perry was somewhat critical of Cruz’s role in shutting down the government in 2013 over a health care battle.

“I’d rather see folks come together, work together to find solutions, but from time to time, you’ve got to lay the marker down,” Perry said, when asked whether Cruz could work with Washington. “There’s that old adage, ‘You gotta hit the mule upside the head to get its attention from time to time.’ I’d suggest that’s exactly what the senator was doing.”

Perry, an Air Force veteran and champion of veterans’ issues, is expected to be particularly helpful in courting veterans, especially in South Carolina, which is home to prominent military bases and an electorate with a strongly pro-military bent — and where Perry had a well-respected team.

Shortly before he exited the race in the fall, Perry had emerged as one of the field’s most pointed critics of Trump, a mantle Cruz now holds as he and Trump battle for first place in Iowa. The former Texas governor noted that a number of other prominent conservatives, including media personality Glenn Beck, have come out against Donald Trump, something Trump’s “going to have to explain.”

After Perry dropped out of the primary, Cruz's campaign immediately began courting his donors and supporters in Texas, while Cruz reached out to the former governor and asked to get together -- a gesture Perry says he appreciated given how little down time candidates get off the trail. When they met, Perry said, Cruz struck him as someone who deep down is likely “shy,” and “one of the best listeners I’ve ever dealt with in the political realm.” It was in stark contrast to more negative perceptions he had held about Cruz, driven by ""media narrative"" and ""through the optics of a campaign.""

“I really didn’t want to talk about policy, I didn’t want to talk politics, I didn’t want to talk philosophy,” he said of their meeting last month. “I wanted to talk about him, who he was, see if I could get a handle on Ted Cruz the man, not Cruz the caricature I’d seen through the political lens. What I found was a very different person than what I had been led to believe.”",5604
531659884430106624,true,"In New York City, Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest http://t.co/mZCed9xH6P",http://nyti.ms/1AQrwot,True,"Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest, in New York City","In the first eight months of the year, blacks and Hispanics represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city, according to a study written in part by Harry G. Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College who is a director of the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.

Many details of the changes planned by the de Blasio administration are still being discussed at City Hall, and many questions remain unanswered. Under the new policy, for example, will the 25 grams or less that constitutes misdemeanor possession under state law be the threshold below which a summons is issued? Will a lit marijuana cigarette be treated differently from a packet of unsmoked cannabis? Other key questions, such as the cost of the fines or whether a criminal record would typically result from a summons, may not be up to City Hall.

A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the city’s five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorney’s offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases.

In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayor’s plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.

Since July, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn.

Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review.

“In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,” Mr. Thompson said. “By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”

Another possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the city’s lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics.

Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were “put through the system,” meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.

In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Department’s crime-fighting strategies. During the Bloomberg administration , the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets.

In 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime. But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in “public view.” In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly , issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.

In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said.

While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the department’s marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve.",5566

Mrs. Clinton is a strong advocate of sensible and effective measures to combat the plague of firearms; Mr. Sanders’s record on guns is relatively weak. Her economic proposals for financial reform reflect a deep understanding of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, including the ways in which it has fallen short. She supports changes that the country badly needs, like controls on high-frequency trading and stronger curbs on bank speculation in derivatives.

Mr. Sanders has scored some rhetorical points against Mrs. Clinton for her longstanding ties to Wall Street, but she has responded well, and it would be comical to watch any of the Republican candidates try to make that case, given that they are all virtually tied to, or actually part of, the business establishment.

One of the most attractive parts of Mrs. Clinton’s economic platform is her pledge to support the well-being and rights of working Americans. Her lifelong fight for women bolsters her credibility in this area, since so many of the problems with labor law hit women the hardest, including those involving child care, paid sick leave, unstable schedules and low wages for tipped workers.

Mrs. Clinton is keenly aware of the wage gap for women, especially for women of color. It’s not just that she’s done her homework — Mrs. Clinton has done her homework on pretty much any subject you’d care to name. Her knowledge comes from a commitment to issues like reproductive rights that is decades old. She was well ahead of Mr. Sanders in calling for repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which severely limits federal money to pay for abortions for poor women.

As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton worked tirelessly, and with important successes, for the nation’s benefit. She was the secretary President Obama needed and wanted: someone who knew leaders around the world, who brought star power as well as expertise to the table. The combination of a new president who talked about inclusiveness and a chief diplomat who had been his rival but shared his vision allowed the United States to repair relations around the world that had been completely trashed by the previous administration.

Mrs. Clinton helped make it possible to impose tougher sanctions on Iran, which in turn led to the important nuclear deal now going into effect. She also fostered closer cooperation with Asian countries. She worked to expand and deepen the dialogue with China and to increase Washington’s institutional ties to the region. Mrs. Clinton had rebuked China when she was first lady for its treatment of women, and she criticized the Beijing government’s record on human rights even as she worked to improve relations.

In January 2011, before the Arab Spring, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech that criticized Arab leaders, saying their countries risked “sinking into the sand” unless they liberalized their political systems and cleaned up their economies. Certainly, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis deepened during her tenure, but she did not cause that.

Mrs. Clinton can be more hawkish on the use of military power than Mr. Obama, as shown by her current call for a no-fly zone in Syria and her earlier support for arming and training Syrian rebels. We are not convinced that a no-fly zone is the right approach in Syria, but we have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton would use American military power effectively and with infinitely more care and wisdom than any of the leading Republican contenders.

Mrs. Clinton, who has been accused of flip-flopping on trade, has shown a refreshing willingness to learn and to explain, as she has in detail, why she changed her mind on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is likely to do more to help workers displaced by the forces of trade than previous presidents have done, and certainly more than any of the Republicans.

Mrs. Clinton has honed a steeliness that will serve her well in negotiating with a difficult Congress on critically important issues like climate change. It will also help her weather what are certain to be more attacks from Republicans and, should she win the White House, the possibility of the same ideological opposition and personal animus that President Obama has endured. Some of the campaign attacks are outrageous, like Donald Trump’s efforts to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital infidelity. Some, like those about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server, are legitimate and deserve forthright answers.

Hillary Clinton is the right choice for the Democrats to present a vision for America that is radically different from the one that leading Republican candidates offer — a vision in which middle-class Americans have a real shot at prosperity, women’s rights are enhanced, undocumented immigrants are given a chance at legitimacy, international alliances are nurtured and the country is kept safe.",5529

Warren was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm even though he was not armed at the time of his arrest. An unlicensed gun had been recovered by police in a nearby yard, WBUR reported, and Warren was eventually convicted.

In throwing out Warren's conviction, the high court said that police did not have a reason to stop and search Warren, as they did not have reasonable suspicion for the stop.

""Lacking any information about facial features, hairstyles, skin tone, height, weight, or other physical characteristics, the victim's description 'contribute[d] nothing to the officers' ability to distinguish the defendant from any other black male' wearing dark clothes and a 'hoodie' in Roxbury,"" the court said in its ruling.

The court added that the description of the clothing was too ""vague,"" and thus there was no evidence for police to ""reasonably and rationally"" target Warren or any other black man wearing dark clothing.

Citing state law that gives individuals the right to avoid speaking with police and to walk away from police if they are not charged with a crime, the court also ruled that running from police does not indicate guilt.

Furthermore, the court said that black men have more of a reason to flee based on racial profiling. To back up its point, the court referenced data on police stops released by the Boston Police Department and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts that showed black individuals have been disproportionately stopped by Boston-area police.

The court said it considered 2014 Boston police data, which found that black persons were 8 percent more likely to be stopped repeatedly and 12 percent more likely to be search and frisked no matter certain conditions like criminal history, and a 2014 ACLU report, which found disproportionate police attention was paid to black persons in Boston from 2007 to 2010, that documented ""a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston.""

""We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop,"" the court wrote in its ruling. ""However, in such circumstances, flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt. Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted for FIO [Field Interrogation and Observation] encounters suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt.""

The court added: ""Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity. Given this reality for black males in the city of Boston, a judge should, in appropriate cases, consider the report's findings in weighing flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.""

Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans said the court's decision relied too heavily on the ""tainted"" ACLU report.

In contrast to a ruling by state’s high court, Boston police insisted that they did not engage in racial profiling https://t.co/zYAoW23D01 — The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) September 21, 2016

""I think they relied heavily on an ACLU report that I think was clearly way out of context,"" Evans said Tuesday, according WBUR. ""I’m a little disappointed that they relied heavily on a report that didn’t take into context who was stopped and why. That report clearly shows that we were targeting the individuals that were driving violence in the city and the hot spots.""

Evans insisted his department's report did not indicate racial bias in police stops.

Matthew Segal, legal director of the state's ACLU chapter, hailed the court's ""powerful ruling.""

""The state’s highest court, in talking about people of color, it’s saying that their lives matter and under the law, their views matter,"" Segal said. ""The reason that’s significant is that all the time in police-civilian encounters there are disputes about what is suspicious and what is not suspicious. So this is an opinion that looks at those encounters through the eyes of a black man who might justifiably be concerned that he will be the victim of profiling.""

724603564946010112,unverified,Twenty-Five Stories Proving Target’s Pro-Trans Bathroom Policy Is Dangerous https://t.co/sYrvTdDACj,http://trib.al/ugBDwan,True,Top Twenty-Five Stories Proving Target’s Pro-Transgender Bathroom Policy Is Dangerous to Women and Children,"As the boycott of Target stores over its pro-transgender bathroom policy grows, the question of just who such a policy puts in danger is a natural one to ask. As these policies proliferate across the country, the number of stories of predators threatening women and children in public restrooms is also growing by the day.

The Target department store chain drew the ire of millions of Americans after it announced it was opening its bathrooms to transgender shoppers and employees and allowing them to choose whatever bathroom they feel like using at any given time.

Days later a #BoycottTarget petition effort launched that drew over 200,000 signatures in a day and over 300,000 by the weekend.

The current imbroglio should not be a surprise, as for years Target has been a big purveyor and supporter of gay-friendly policies and causes. So, this current bathroom policy issue is not the first time the chain waded into left-wing issues.

On its corporate website, for instance, there are many posts and announcements celebrating the LGBT lifestyle.

Furthermore, last year, Target was a corporate sponsor of the “Out & Equal” conference, a summit aimed at forcing corporations into adopting gay-friendly workplace policies.

The company was also praised by gay groups for its “It Gets Better” campaign meant to boost the status of homosexuality in the U.S.

In addition, Target raised the ire of many with its decision to re-engineer its kids’ sections, when in August of 2015 the chain announced it was eliminating “gender specific” labels and store signage for kids’ clothing and toy sections.

The radical homosexual agenda is not the only liberal issue Target has taken on. Two years ago the company demanded that customers “not bring firearms” into stores, despite legal concealed-carry laws saying gun owners may do so.

The company also has a long list of political causes and candidates it has donated to over the years.

Still, in defense of such polices, liberals ask what harm could come to anyone if bathrooms are opened up to men dressed as women, or others who claim to be transgender? On the other hand, those who reject these policies ask why the nation should put women and children in danger by allowing predators to more easily enter and install video cameras in bathrooms and changing rooms or otherwise threaten and harass people using the restroom?

Target itself has had incidents of predators threatening children in its bathrooms. Only weeks ago such an incident occurred in a Cedar Park, Texas store.

But there are dozens of such stories over the last 16 months or so highlighting the problem with setting policies that would make access to public restrooms easier for predators.

First up are five incidents in which predatory men were discovered committing criminal actions in public restrooms. Some of these men were arrested while dressed as women; others claimed to be transgender women.

Man in women’s locker room cites gender rule Seattle Parks and Recreation is facing a first-of-a-kind challenge to gender bathroom rules. A man undressed in a women’s locker room, citing a new state rule that allows people to choose a bathroom based on gender identity. Man Dressed as Woman Arrested for Spying Into Mall Bathroom Stall, Police Say A man dressed as a woman was arrested in Virginia on Monday after police say he was caught peeping into restroom stalls three times in the past year. Richard Rodriguez, 30, filmed a woman in a bathroom stall at the Potomac Mills Mall, Prince William County Police said on Tuesday. A 35-year-old woman was in the stall when she saw a bag moved toward her under the stall divider. Rodriguez apparently had been filming her, police said. Palmdale man arrested for videotaping in women’s bathroom PALMDALE – A 33-year-old Palmdale man who allegedly dressed as a woman while secretly videotaping females using a department store bathroom was charged with several misdemeanor counts Tuesday, authorities said. Jason Pomare was charged with six counts of unlawful use of a concealed camera for the purposes of sexual gratification, according to Sergeant Brian Hudson of the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau. Sexual predator jailed after claiming to be ‘transgender’ to assault women in shelter A biological man claiming to be ‘transgender’ so as to gain access to and prey on women at two Toronto shelters was jailed “indefinitely” last week after being declared by a judge a “dangerous offender.” Pro-family leaders are pointing out that this is exactly the type of incident they warned of as the Ontario government passed its “gender identity” bill, dubbed the “bathroom bill,” in 2012. University of Toronto Dumps Transgender Bathrooms After Peeping Incidents The administration at the University of Toronto was recently enlightened on why two separate washrooms are generally established for men and women sharing co-ed residencies.

Here are nineteen more stories of predators using public bathrooms to criminally victimize women and children:

With all these stories, it is also apropos to ask just how many Americans these transgender polices would affect. By even the most generous estimations only .3 percent of the nation claims to be transgender. So, in the end, these extreme policies of bending over backwards for people who claim to be transgender are designed for less than half of one percent of Americans.

But officials are bracing for the possibility of a much higher tally than what blood tests have revealed so far.

""There could be many more,"" Gov. Rick Snyder told CNN, ""and we're assuming that.""

In an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on Wednesday , the state's embattled governor discussed efforts to repair damage in Flint, the investigation into how lead-poisoned water ended up in residents' homes and the class action lawsuits against the city and state.

One difficulty officials are facing, Snyder said, is that lead might no longer show up in a blood test after time has passed.

""We need to establish the right medical protocols, the public health pieces, the educational process things, to watch these kids for years that didn't have higher blood levels in terms of a blood test,"" he said. ""Because they could be affected.""

It's unclear how long it will take to replace lead pipes in Flint and throughout the state, Snyder said.

""It's too soon to tell,"" he said, ""because I can't tell you how many pipes and where they are. But as a practice now, we should be working on that, very clearly.""

In the meantime, the state government is providing bottled water and water filters for residents.

""This is about continuing to take action,"" Snyder said at a news conference earlier Wednesday.

Still, officials could not give a timeline on when people would be able to turn on their taps. Snyder said work is being done to find lead service lines, to be followed by a cost calculation for replacing them.

The short-term goal is to recoat the pipes, he said.

Michael Moore calls for governor's arrest

Calls for Snyder's resignation have been growing as criticism mounts over the government's handling of the crisis.

Filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore has been particularly vocal, saying the governor should be arrested for his role in the water crisis. A plan to save $15 million on Flint's water bills may now cost $1.5 billion to clean up, Moore said.

""He's known about this for some time. He's trying to PR this thing right now, he's trying to blame civil servants for causing this or whatever,"" Moore told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""This is squarely in his lap.""

JUST WATCHED Michael Moore: Flint water crisis 'a racial crime' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Michael Moore: Flint water crisis 'a racial crime' 01:30

And more importantly, Moore said, the governor hasn't done anything to remove lead pipes to make drinking water safe again.

""Flint doesn't need bottled water sent to them,"" Moore said. ""We need those pipes replaced, and not a single pipe has been replaced since they discovered lead in the water.""

Snyder has blamed the situation on incompetent bureaucrats, specifically citing ""a handful of quote-unquote experts that were career civil servant people that made terrible decisions.""

Already, Susan Hedman, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regional administrator for Flint, has resigned.

State Attorney General Bill Schuette said he is appointing a former prosecutor and Detroit's former FBI chief to join the investigation of the water crisis, creating a ""conflict wall"" between the state's inquiry and the lawsuits targeting the state.

The state investigation aims to determine ""whether any Michigan laws were violated in the process that created a major public health crisis for Flint residents.""

Governor appoints expert committee

Snyder announced Wednesday that he had appointed 17 health and environmental experts to a committee tasked with finding a long-term solution to the water crisis.

It's the latest of a number of task forces and investigations into the causes of the pollution and how to make things right for Flint.

Among those appointed to the committee is Virginia Tech University professor Marc Edwards, the researcher who conducted numerous tests on Flint's water system and was the first to publicly identify high levels of lead.

But some groups aren't waiting for the findings of a committee. On Wednesday, a group of organizations filed a federal lawsuit accusing the Flint and Michigan governments of violating federal laws that regulate drinking water.

Flint's state of emergency -- declared at municipal and state levels -- began years ago when the city suffered a financial crisis. The state took over the city's budget and decided to temporarily switch Flint's water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money. After the switch, residents complained their water had problems, and high levels of lead were found in the water supply.

The city switched back to the Lake Huron water supply in October, but the damage was already done to lead pipes.

The focus of the committee, the governor's office said, is to make recommendations about the health of residents exposed to lead and determine potential upgrades to infrastructure.

New lawsuit

On the same day Snyder spoke about the committee, a coalition of activists and national groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and ACLU of Michigan, filed a federal lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that city and state officials have violated the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

The suit calls for a federal court to order the city and state governments to carry out additional water testing and to replace all lead water pipes at no cost to Flint residents.",5463

In a surprise move, the Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest rate.

The benchmark rate of -0.1% means that commercial banks will be charged by the central bank for some deposits.

It is designed to encourage them to use their reserves to lend to businesses in an attempt to counter Japan's economic stagnation.

The charge does not directly apply to ordinary customers' accounts.

The country is desperate to increase spending and investment.

Desperate

One of the side effects of a moribund economy is falling prices - something that can send an economy into a downward spiral as customers hold off spending in the hope prices will fall yet lower.

Is deflation such a bad thing?

What are negative interest rates?

Why use negative interest rates?

Japan has been desperate to boost consumer spending for years. At one point it even issued shopping vouchers to stimulate demand.

The eurozone has negative interest rates, but this is a first for the third-largest economy.

It is a move that has been on the cards for Japan's stagnating economy for well over 10 years.

The decision to go negative came after a narrow 5-4 vote at the Bank of Japan's first meeting of the year on Friday.

""The BoJ will cut interest rates further into negative territory if judged as necessary,"" the Bank of Japan (BoJ) said, adding it would continue as long as needed to achieve an inflation target of 2%.

Some analysts have cast doubt over how effective the rate cut will be.

Analysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent

The Bank of Japan is imposing a negative interest rate on accounts it holds for commercial banks. It will start to charge them for looking after their cash. The European Central Bank and a few others are already doing it. But the Bank of Japan's negative rate is going to bite very gradually. The amount affected will build up over time. The move does not directly affect savers. They don't have accounts at the central bank. But certainly their banks could decide to pass on the cost they in turn will face as the impact of the negative rate accumulates. So perhaps in time savers will in effect be paying to keep their money at the bank. So they would have more of an incentive to spend.

In a press conference, the BoJ's governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the weakening growth rate of the global economy was the main factor behind the move: ""Japan's economy continues to recover moderately and the underlying price trend is improving steadily... further falls in oil prices, uncertainty over emerging economies, including China, and global market instability could hurt business confidence and delay the eradication of people's deflationary mindset.""

Earlier in the day, fresh economic data had again highlighted concerns over economic growth. The December core inflation rate was shown to be at 0.1% - far below the central bank's target.

Asian shares jumped and the yen fell across the board in reaction to the announcement. Japanese banks though saw their shares drop on the news as lenders are likely to see their margins squeezed even more.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan's export driven economy has been struggling in recent years

Mariko Oi, BBC News: 'Kuroda bazooka'

The decision to implement a negative interest rate has been dubbed ""Kuroda bazooka"" after the governor of the Bank of Japan.

Haruhiko Kuroda is well known for making surprise moves that shock investors. Only a few weeks ago, Mr Kuroda told the parliamentary budget committee that he would not introduce more stimulus for the economy.

So today's announcement caused the stock market to jump while the yen fell sharply against major currencies.

The option of lowering the cost of borrowing below zero has been on the cards for Japan's central bank since the early 2000s and it was the first in the world to consider it.

But when it comes to implementing the policy, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland were first, followed by the European Central Bank which had to do everything it could to keep the EU economy afloat after the eurozone economic crisis.

Last resort

There are doubts, however, over how well the new policy will work.

""Negative interest rates are one of the last instruments in the BoJ's tool box,"" Martin Schulz of the Fujitsu Institute in Tokyo told the BBC. ""But their impact is unlikely to be strong.""

Mr Schulz cautioned that in the eurozone, negative interest rates are being used to tackle a financial crisis, whereas Japan is in a protracted slow growth environment.

""In Japan, credit didn't expand not because banks were unwilling to lend but because businesses didn't see the investment perspective to borrow. Even with negative interest rates, this situation will not change.""

""Businesses don't need money - they need investment opportunities. And that can only be achieved by structural reforms, not by monetary policy,"" he said.

The decision comes in addition to the BoJ's massive asset-buying programme, which over the past years has failed to boost growth.

Bill Blain, of Mint Partners, said monetary authorities' moves to ever-cheaper money since the financial crisis that began in 2008 have distorted global markets - and investors were uneasy: ""Investors are worried that the only place we've seen any inflation has been in financial assets, things like stocks, property and bonds. And as a result everyone is suddenly worried they are sitting on nightmares.""",5433

GREEN BAY, Wisconsin — After saying on Wednesday that he believes there should be punishment for women who undergo abortions if the procedure was outlawed, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walked back the comment hours later.

In an exclusive interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, the GOP front-runner described himself multiple times as “pro-life” but struggled to define what the legal ramifications of that position should be. When continually pressed for what the answer is regarding punishing women who would break any theoretical ban, Trump said the “answer is that there has to be some form of punishment, yeah.”

Later in the day, his campaign released a statement refocusing who would be punished should abortion become illegal. “If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,” the statement said. “The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.”

When asked what kind of punishment he had in mind, Trump lacked specifics and said that he has “not determined what the punishment would be.” Trump noted that he does “take positions on everything else, but this is a very complicated position.""

“If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law,” Matthews stated, making the pivot from the moral position of being pro-life to the practical implications of implementing that position in the law.

Trump asked Matthews, “are you going to say, well wait, are you going to say put them in jail? Is that the punishment you’re talking about?”

Matthews responded that that’s the question he was asking the front-runner himself. Trump responded that he was pro-life.

The MSNBC host followed up wondering if a man should bear responsibility for abortions as well, to which Trump said “no,” he didn’t think so.

Trump asked repeatedly about the Catholic church’s position on abortion, at multiple points trying to turn the questions on the interviewer himself in relation to how he squared the moral position of the church with the real life implications.

Should the United States change the law of the land on abortion as set by the landmark SCOTUS ruling Roe vs Wade Trump said, “you’ll go back to a position like they had where people will, perhaps, go to illegal places.” Still, he maintains “you have to ban it.”

Ohio Republican John Kasich, who participated in an MSNBC town hall moderated by NBC's Chuck Todd earlier in the day, was asked if he agreed with Trump on the prospect of punishing women for abortion. ""Absolutely not,"" Kasich responded. ""I do have exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother but of course women shouldn’t be punished,"" he added.

In Wednesday's town hall meeting, Trump also continued the defense of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, saying that he didn’t think an initial apology from his campaign manager would’ve changed the current situation.

“I think if he called up to apologize I think we’d be in the exact same place,” he told Matthews, wondering if Lewandowski may have even apologized in the moment. “They’re destroying a very good person…over nothing” Trump said. “He’s a good person with a wonderful family.""

Trump called the incident in question “so minor"" before continuing to discredit former Brietbart reporter Michelle Fields by attacking the premise of her story. “What’s contact?” he hedged, noting that her facial expression didn’t change despite saying she was almost pulled to the ground by Lewandowski. Trump later added that he was “skeptical” about her.

Related: Trump on Campaign Manager -- ""I Can't Destroy a Man.""

The GOP front-runner says “nobody respects women” more than he does. That respect, however, doesn’t necessarily translate to Fields. “I would say I don’t have great respect for her,” Trump told Matthews. He also dodged when asked why he didn’t have sympathy for Fields, instead pointing out that the tape being used by the police investigation was his tape and saying that there are more pressing issues at play, like ISIS and foreign threats.

As he’s said before, Trump alleged that Fields touched him twice and questioned if he should even go so far as to press charges against her. He once again posited that she was breaking the rules as the press conference was over and she was still trying to ask questions by dogging him as he left the room.

Trump also called out the Jupiter Police, saying that “what they’ve done is, I think, outrageous.",5432
692287441168900097,non-rumor,Appeal Court judges rule so-called bedroom tax is discriminatory in two cases brought against UK government https://t.co/Y4k4r2robi,http://bbc.in/1SatqJ4,True,'Bedroom tax': Government loses Court of Appeal cases,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""I could cry with happiness,"" said grandparent Paul Rutherford

The Court of Appeal has ruled that the so-called bedroom tax discriminates against a domestic violence victim and the family of a disabled teenager.

The ruling followed legal challenges by a woman who has a panic room in her home, and the grandparents of a 15-year-old who requires overnight care.

The removal in 2013 of what the government calls the spare room subsidy cuts benefits for social housing tenants with a ""spare"" room.

Ministers have said they will appeal.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) argued that it had given councils money to make discretionary payments to people facing hardship because of the policy change.

The case is now due to be decided in the Supreme Court.

What is the 'bedroom tax'?

Family: 'Somebody had to do something'

Prime Minister David Cameron said the government would ""look very carefully"" at the judgement. ""But our fundamental position is, it is unfair to subsidise spare rooms in the social sector if we don't subsidise them in the private sector.""

One of the cases - brought by a woman identified as ""A"" - concerned the effect of the policy on women living in properties adapted because of risks to their lives. Her home was equipped with a panic room.

The second case - brought by Pembrokeshire couple Paul and Susan Rutherford and their 15-year-old grandson Warren - focused on the impact of the policy on disabled children needing overnight care.

The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the ruling would affect only people within these two specific groups - severely disabled children needing overnight care and victims of domestic violence living in specially adapted accommodation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron defended the so-called 'bedroom tax' at PMQs

There are believed to be about 300 such victims of domestic violence and thousands of severely disabled children in this situation.

The Court of Appeal ruling comes after a judicial review brought by the Rutherfords was dismissed in the High Court in 2014.

Housing benefit changes - dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by Labour - were introduced in April 2013. Since then families claiming housing benefits have been assessed for the number of bedrooms they actually need.

Families deemed by their local authorities to have too much living space have received reduced benefits, with payments being cut by 14% if they have one spare bedroom.

Both ""A"" and the Rutherfords claimed that the policy change discriminated against them unlawfully.

'Not justified'

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Vos ruled in their favour, saying the ""admitted discrimination"" in each case ""has not been justified by the Secretary of State"".

Mr Rutherford said he was ""absolutely delighted"" with the ruling, adding: ""I couldn't have had a better start to the day.""

""It was so unfair that somebody had to do something to get the law changed.""

Business minister Anna Soubry told BBC Radio 4 that she ""very much hoped"" the government would look again at this issue.

Michael Spencer, from the Child Poverty Action Group, said the ruling meant families ""can stay in their homes safe in the knowledge that their disabled children can get the care they need"".

Rebekah Carrier, a solicitor acting for ""A"", said: ""Our client's life is at risk and she is terrified. The anxiety caused by the bedroom tax and the uncertainty about this case has been huge.""

Analysis

By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent

Today's judgement is another example of the power of judicial review.

The spare room subsidy, more commonly known as the bedroom tax, could hardly be a more politically contentious policy.

The victories for the two families at the heart of these cases show once again that there is virtually no area of government decision making that cannot be scrutinised by the independent judiciary.

Judges are at pains not to make political decisions, but will step in where there is illegality.

A judicial review can be brought by anyone and allows the court to rule on whether the government (or any other public body) has acted lawfully.

Governments may find them frustrating, but they remain a critical part of our constitutional arrangements in holding public bodies to account.

A spokesman for the DWP said the government ""fundamentally"" disagreed with the court's ruling.

""We have already been granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. We know there will be people who need extra support.

""That is why we are giving local authorities over £870m in extra funding over the next five years to help ensure people in difficult situations like these don't lose out.""

Shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said the ruling provided ""a glimmer of hope for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been hit by this cruel policy"".

""Surely the time has now come for the Tories to discover a conscience, listen to the courts as well as the public, and scrap the hated bedroom tax.""

The government - which rejects the term ""bedroom tax"" - says the regulations remove what is in fact a spare room subsidy.

It says it aims to encourage people to move to smaller properties, potentially saving about £480m a year from the housing benefit bill.",5373

While the SJW crowd cheered the decision, realists around the country signaled their collective displeasure with a boycott of the store spearheaded by The American Family Association. In a relatively short time, more than one million people had signed on to the protest. (Fox News)

More than one million people have decided they will no longer buy their Nutter Butters or Wet Wipes at Target. The American Family Association launched a boycott of the nation’s second largest retailer a week ago – over Target’s corporate policy allowing men who identify as women to use the bathrooms and fitting rooms of their choosing. “We believe that everyone – every team member, every guest, and every community – deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally,” the company wrote in a statement. “Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.”

Is the boycott having any sort of effect in such a short period of time? These things are often hard to gauge, but in this case there seems to be a strong hint provided in the fact that the company’s stock has taken a precipitous drop during the same period. (Daily Caller)

On Friday, the shares of Target Corporation Common Stock (TGT) fell 2.52 percent in one day, according to recent reports. In addition since April 19th, the day they announced the new policy, the stock went from a share value of $84.14 to $79.27 per share. That’s a drop of 5.8 percent in 10 days. The Family Policy institute says they estimate that to be a loss to the company of $2.5 billion dollars… As previously reported, in addition to signing the “boycott pledge” the group is encouraging people to post on Target’s Facebook page that they are upset about the new policy.

While I’m not generally a fan of boycotts as a means of enacting political change, this one is understandable and, as I said above, predictable. I also find the focus of the protest message to be a bit off the mark as well, while understanding the concerns being raised. Opponents of this misguided policy at Target continue to stress the danger of sexual predators using the open bathroom access as an invitation to perpetrate assaults. While I suppose it’s possible, it also seems unlikely that a determined predator would allow a gender designation sign on a door stop them from pursuing their victims, and incidents of such attacks seem to be rare. These scenarios are less disconcerting than cases where women are forced to share locker rooms and showers with men, opening the door to creepy voyeurs breaking out their cell phone cameras and worse.

Running the debate immediately to these worst case scenarios overshadows the underlying argument to be made. What about the simple concept of propriety and privacy which any civilized person should accept? Women should not be forced to use the bathroom, change in a locker room or take a shower in front of a strange man. Is that really so difficult to understand or express in a public policy statement?

This isn’t the first time Target has dipped a toe into the troubled “gender identity” waters. Last summer we talked about the store’s new policy of “de-gendering” the toys and clothing aisles so as not to offend anyone. The sad part of all this is that this stupid, pointless battle (which was clearly going to affect the company’s sales no matter which way they went on it) was completely unnecessary. Just as with public, government facilities, there is a simple (if still costly) solution, assuming one believes that a solution is required. In fact San Francisco (of all places) hit on the idea very early in the national debate. If a company or public facility truly feels that they must jump into this entire “degendering” fiasco, then in addition to traditional facilities for each gender, simply add on a third, gender neutral bathroom or other facility. Then anyone going in can be informed that there is no gender requirement for occupancy and, likewise, the owner/management offers no guarantee as to the gender of the other patrons you may encounter in there. Alternately, when new facilities are constructed, put in multiple, single user facilities and just label them as “shower” or “bathroom” or “changing room.”

Problem solved. Then, if someone wants to insist that they must be allowed in public facilities with people of the opposite gender, their true agenda is exposed. (You will be made to not only care, but to participate.) This is an important aspect of the conversation which the SJW all to often succeeds in suppressing. We aren’t having a conversation here about discrimination or the suppression of anyone else’s rights. Dress however you wish. And for that matter, the vast majority of us aren’t going to care one way or the other what you call yourself despite the obvious denial of basic genetics and science on display. The real motivation of the SJW is to force such twisted claims on everyone else and mandate their participation even when it comes at the expense of the rights of the majority.",5338

Greece has ""seriously neglected"" its obligations to control the external frontier of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone, the European Commission says in a draft report.

The assessment found failures to register, check and fingerprint migrants arriving in November.

Greece is now likely to be given three months to rectify the situation.

If it does not improve, the EU may recommend that other Schengen states reintroduce temporary border controls.

The Greek government has hit out at what it called the EU's ""blame games"", criticising the lack of ""common action"" by European countries to respond to the migrant crisis.

More than 850,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Greece last year.

A further 44,000 have reached the Greek islands since the start of 2016, mostly arriving on Lesbos, Samos and Chios from the Turkish mainland.

There is growing pressure on Athens to deal with the flow of migrants, most of whom go on to travel through Europe to countries such as Germany and Sweden.

Several EU states, including Austria and Hungary, have already introduced temporary border controls, as the principle of passport-free travel comes under increased strain.

Schengen: Controversial EU free movement deal explained

Migrants feel chill as Europe tightens frontier checks

Which countries are in the Schengen zone?

On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels that the ""draft report concludes that Greece seriously neglected its obligations"" under the Schengen agreement.

He said there were ""serious deficiencies in the carrying out of external border controls that must be overcome and dealt with by the Greek authorities"".

Spot checks by EU inspectors in November found Greece was failing to register arrivals properly, to fingerprint everyone, to see whether identity documents were genuine, and to check people against Interpol and other databases.

EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos conceded that Greece had ""started undertaking efforts towards rectifying and complying with the Schengen rules"" since then.

However, ""substantial improvements"" were needed.

Responding to the draft report, the Greek government said it was ""not constructive to isolate Greece for creating a media impression"", based on outdated information.

A spokeswoman said Greece had repeatedly asked for help from the EU's border force Frontex to boost controls, but that the response had been ""small"".

Criticising a lack of EU progress on the crisis, she said: ""Greece has done more than it could to stand to its obligations. We expect from everyone else to do the same.""

Serious warning

The report must be approved by other Schengen members before the Commission can set the three-month deadline.

But this is a serious warning to Greece to improve things, says the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels.

Otherwise, border checks to limit the movement of migrants within Europe may be instituted, preventing those in Greece from travelling north.

Timing is crucial - by the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels

The prospect of many thousands more refugees and migrants coming this summer is what's worrying the countries they head for, primarily Austria, Germany and Sweden.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel told an audience on Tuesday: ""Of course we must significantly reduce the number of refugees and we are working on that.""

So it's likely Greece will now be given until mid-May to get to grips with the influx of people to its islands.

And the timing is crucial. Mid-May could be when a summer surge of refugees reaching the EU is starting to peak.

The temporary border controls which countries like Germany have in place will be due to expire.

To prolong the controls governments will need an official assessment by the European Commission that Greece is still failing.

Is EU's Schengen border-free dream at an end?

On Monday, several EU states, which have already introduced temporary border controls, said they planned to prolong their restrictions for up to two years.

Meanwhile the EU is said to be considering helping Macedonia, which is not a member of the EU or Schengen, to tighten security at its border with Greece.

Greek Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas condemned the proposals, warning they would trap people.

""We do not intend to become a cemetery of souls,"" Mr Mouzalas told the Financial Times (behind paywall).

He also told BBC Newsnight that Belgium had told his country to ""push"" migrants ""back in the sea"" as a solution to the crisis.

However, Belgian Migration Minister Theo Francken condemned the claims, calling them ""grotesque and very regrettable"".

A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",5324

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (4th R) visits the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun to pay tribute to founding President Kim Il Sung and former leader Kim Jong Il to mark the 61st anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War, in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 27, 2014. REUTERS/KCNA

North Korea’s state media, which usually chronicles Kim’s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3, and Kim was absent from early state media coverage of a major political anniversary on Friday.

In the previous two years, Kim marked the anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s Workers’ Party with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.

Last year, that visit was covered about four hours later by the state’s KCNA news agency, and by the daily Rodong Sinmun newspaper. As of about 8 a.m. (7.00 p.m. EDT) on Friday, there was no KCNA report of an event at the mausoleum. Friday’s Rodong Sinmun could not yet be seen on its website.

Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, did not always attend the Oct. 10 memorial event when he was in power.

The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said on Thursday that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

“He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,” the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,” the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with important officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.

“Kim Jong Un is in total control,” said the source.

Kim’s absence from public view is fuelling speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle.

“The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,” said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

NOT KIM’S FIRST ABSENCE

North Korean officials have denied that Kim’s public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.

It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim’s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean television report late last month that said he was suffering from “discomfort”.

Some North Korea watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un’s health said rumors of a coup were “rubbish”.

“It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,” said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.

Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim’s name has not disappeared from state propaganda.

Thursday’s edition of the Rodong Sinmun carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked “the Marshal” for his support during the competition.

Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.

“Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,” he said.",5315

I’m not going to argue that every family should follow this rule. You are your kids’ parents. Short of real and obvious harm to them, how you bring them up is your business.

We just felt a compelling, irresistible responsibility for that little boy, that we must be the ones to respond to his (many) night-time cries, and personally introduce him to colors, touch, sound, movement, and love—just as I had done for him while he was in my womb. When he had his first heartbeat, I was there. When he had his first breath, both mom and dad were there. And we refused to leave. Yes, it hurt. Then and now, I sometimes want to quit and go back to work (snide comments from the president and everyone else certainly don’t help). But, yes, it was and is completely worth it.

That decision required my husband to keep a crappy, low-wage job far beneath his abilities because it let him work nights and weekends, meaning he could care for our child while I was at work. (My super-generous Catholic boss allowed me to work from home several afternoons a week post-baby, which made the schedules just work for us.) It required me to scrimp every bit of sick and personal leave my employer (graciously!) offered so I could stay with our son full-time after his birth for just six weeks. It required us each to rush home after work instead of enjoying networking and relaxing with colleagues over a drink or meal. It required us to stay home on weekends, and forget date nights, movies in the theater, eating out, all those little American luxuries. But we did it, and it was the right thing. We felt this was one way we chose to love our child. And it made our high-touch, heavy-nursing momma’s boy very fat and happy. He, and our subsequent two, essentially feel this way about their mother (and her cold heart needs it):



My Children and I Are Not Grist for the Global Economy

Our arrangement didn’t generate so many tax revenues for President Obama’s high-tax, big-government planned economy. Maybe that’s why he declared non-parent child-care a “must-have” in Tuesdays’ State of the Union speech: “It’s not a nice-to-have—it’s a must-have. It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.”

Let’s make sure every family has at least 2 taxpayers because tax $$$ are needed so much more than kids having mom or dad at home #SOTU — Tina Turner (@Tina46129189) January 21, 2015

Mr. President, I don’t give a damn about national economic priorities for other people. I am concerned with my family’s priorities for our children. Huge chunks of time spent with people who are not their parents makes my three little people depressed, anxious, and disruptive. Watch that turn into depressed, anxious, non-productive young adults. Watch it turn into medicated, emotionally troubled citizens. Oh, that costs society a lot of money, too? Well, I still don’t give a damn. Because I don’t care about society. I care about my children. And parents’ concern for their children first is what keeps society healthy, entirely naturally and with no costly social reconstruction programs needed. So maybe encourage instead of punch it.

Why does president’s plan for reforming tax code offer nothing to parents with a stay-at-home mom? Exclusionary & divisive. #sotuAEI — W Bradford Wilcox (@WilcoxNMP) January 21, 2015

Here Comes the Patriarchy to Narrow Female Choices

I choose to give up a nearly six-figure income in my mid-twenties, at great personal and professional inconvenience, to give my devilish, glorious children the gift of their own mommy’s hand on their owies and her own voice reading them real books, in person. The little monkeys like both very much. It satisfies their tiny souls. You can’t box me in, sir, because despite all that I’m still the family breadwinner—at home, during naps, and when my husband is home from graduate school. I fit in your government favorites category, but I don’t. How annoying to us both. It’s especially annoying to me to know that bureaucrats don’t like the way my husband and I prefer to arrange our life for our children’s comfort.

Not only that, they’re going to make me pay for it. First, economically: As the loser in a system of government preferences, I have to pay for goodies for other people that aren’t goodies for me. Second, socially: I have to hold my head high as a woman who sticks to her innate criteria for love and justice while the president of the free world takes to international television to bash me for having criteria that don’t match those of an egotistical, money-focused alpha male. How phallo-centric. And patriarchal.

All those people who want to hire me can find another capable employee. But nobody can replace my babies’ momma. And don’t you ever dare try. To pretend that it’s right to force this mom away from her children by increasing my taxes and compressing the job market to pay for other families who make different decisions is a total jerk move.",5263
365497016098369536,false,Water leaks at Fukushima could contaminate entire Pacific Ocean http://t.co/cHeAMMChDN,http://on.rt.com/50ro3u,True,Water leaks at Fukushima could contaminate entire Pacific Ocean,"Two and a half years after the Fukashima tragedy Japan does not want to admit how serious it is, but it is obvious the drastic environmental implications are to follow, Harvey Wasserman, journalist and advocate for renewable energy, told RT.

RT:Japanese officials have admitted a leak at Fukushima has been happening for two years and is worse than earlier thought. Why did it take so long to evaluate the actual repercussions of the tragedy and take decisive measures to tackle them?

HW: The Japanese authorities have been covering up the true depth of the disaster because they don’t want to embarrass themselves and the global nuclear industry and they are trying to open up another nuclear plant in Japan. When the Japanese people now find out that the accident is worse than we thought and they have been leaking many tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean for almost two and a half years, this is a catastrophe. Tokyo Electric has no idea how to control this accident. This is absolutely terrifying after two and a half years. To find out that these reactors have been out of control, now that they can’t control this they don’t know what’s going on. This is not a primitive backward country; this is Japan with advanced technology. It has very serious implications for nuclear power all over the world.

RT:Why the plant's operator failed to contain the leak?

HW: Because they don’t know what to do. This has never happened before. You have three explosions; you have four nuclear reactors that are severely compromised. No one ever planned for this. This is an apocalyptic event. This is something that could contaminate the entire Pacific Ocean. It is extremely serious. The reality is that Tokyo Electric does not know what is happening and does not know how to control what is going on. Our entire planet is at risk here. This is two and a half years after these explosions and they are still in the dark. It’s terrifying.



Prof. Christopher Busby, to the contrary, believes that ""the Pacific Ocean is big enough for this level of release not to represent the global catastrophe that some are predicting"" and provides his calculations in his article on RT.com.



RT:An estimated 300 tonnes of contaminated water is spilling daily into the ocean. How come Tepco insists the leaks still pose no big threat to the environment?

HW: They are lying; they can’t face the reality of this situation. When have very serious quantities of radiation going into the Pacific Ocean. There is no medical or epidemiological or scientific basis for estimating how much damage this will cost. We are on entirely new ground here and this cannot go by without a serious impact on the entire human race. This is a terrible tragedy.



RT:The clean-up was previously on Tepco alone. Why didn't the government step in earlier? Rectifying an accident like the one at Fukushima needs a comprehensive approach, doesn't it?

HW: The problem is that the company does not want to admit how serious this is and the government of Japan doesn’t want to admit how serious this is. And even if the government of Japan steps in, they don’t know what to do. This particular administration in Japan wants to open the other nuclear plants. 50 nuclear plants have been shut in Japan since the accident and they want to reopen them. This is very political, because if they admit to how bad the things are in Fukushima the public is not going to stand for them re opening other nuclear plants, including some that are owned by Tokyo Electric Power. How do you have a huge utility company on one hand saying that we can’t control all these 300 tons of radioactive liquid going into the Pacific Ocean every day, and on the other hand we want you to let us open these other nuclear reactors? This is a catastrophe for them and that’s why they have been lying about it because they want to open other nuclear plants but they don’t want the public to know how serious the damage is in Fukushima.

RT:According to some estimates it will take 40 years to clean-up the contaminated area. Why so long?

HW: That is not long enough. It will never be cleaned up. We have materials there that are radioactive, that are harmful, and that are dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. They can talk about cleaning it up in 40 years but it will never be cleaned up. You will never be able to go back on that site. The radioactivity will be in the waters forever.

RT:What long-term impact of the radiation leak on Japan and its neighbouring countries we should expect in the future?

HW: There are serious health impacts. People will be harmed. We are seeing 40% rate of thyroid damage among children in the area and this is a huge impact and it will go up, not down. More and more radiation is escaping from the water and tritium into the atmosphere. And radiation to the thyroid is very serious, especially among small children and we are already seeing a 40% rate. People will be suffering for hundreds of years. I interviewed people in central Pennsylvania a year after the accident and discovered tremendous health impacts among the people there. We know that Chernobyl did tremendous damage to people in Belarus and Ukraine and now we are going to see it again in Fukushima.",5255

Three to four million people could be infected with Zika virus in the Americas this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts.

Most will not develop symptoms, but the virus, spread by mosquitoes, has been linked to brain defects in babies.

Meanwhile, the US says it hopes to begin human vaccine trials by the end of 2016.

The head of the International Olympic Committee says steps are being taken to protect the Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Thomas Bach said the IOC would issue advice this week on how to keep athletes and visitors safe in Brazil, the worst affected country.

WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said Zika had gone ""from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions"".

She has set up a Zika ""emergency team"" after the ""explosive"" spread of the virus.

It will meet on Monday to decide whether Zika should be treated as a global emergency.

The last time an international emergency was declared was for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people.

Zika: What you need to know

Zika was first detected in Uganda in 1947, but has never caused an outbreak on this scale.

Brazil reported the first cases of Zika in South America in May 2015.

Most cases result in no symptoms and it is hard to test for, but WHO officials said between 500,000 and 1.5 million people had been infected in the country.

The virus has since spread to more than 20 countries in the region.

At the same time there has been a steep rise in levels of microcephaly - babies born with abnormally small heads - and the rare nervous system disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome.

The link between the virus and these disorders has not been confirmed, but Dr Chan said it was ""strongly suspected"" and was ""deeply alarming"".

And she warned the situation could yet deteriorate as ""this year's El Nino weather patterns are expected to increase mosquito populations greatly in many areas"".

The BBC's David Shukman, reporting from Recife in north-east Brazil, said doctors were ""overwhelmed"" by cases of microcephaly.

One hospital in the city had gone from dealing with an average of five cases a year to 300 in the past six months.

Emergency team

Earlier, doctors writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association said Zika had ""explosive pandemic potential"" and said the WHO's failure to act swiftly on Ebola probably cost thousands of lives.

In a statement to the executive board meeting of the WHO, Dr Chan said: ""The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty.

""Questions abound - we need to get some answers quickly.

""For all these reasons, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee.

""I am asking the Committee for advice on the appropriate level of international concern and for recommended measures that should be undertaken in affected countries and elsewhere.""

Vaccine

Officials from the US National Institute of Health said they had two potential Zika vaccines in development.

One that is based on an experimental West Nile vaccine could be repurposed for Zika and enter clinical trials by the end of 2016, Dr Anthony Fauci from NIH said.

He said talks were already taking place with pharmaceutical companies, but a vaccine would not be widely available for several years.

Meanwhile Dr Anne Schuchat, from the Centers for Disease Control confirmed there had been 31 cases of Zika in the country - all linked to travel to the affected areas.

At a news conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the country's response to the virus so far had been ""consistent with the kind of threat that could be out there"".

""At this point, here in the United States, the risk of a disease spread by mosquitoes is quite low, the January temperatures in North America are quite inhospitable to the mosquito populations.""

""But, obviously that's going to change,"" he added.

Dr Carissa Etienne, the regional-director for the WHO Pan American Health Organization, said the link between the abnormalities and Zika had not been confirmed.

But she added: ""We cannot tolerate the prospect of more babies being born with neurological and other malformations and more people facing the threat of paralysis.""

What is the Zika virus:

Spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which also carries dengue fever and yellow fever

mosquito, which also carries dengue fever and yellow fever First discovered in Africa in the 1940s but is now spreading in Latin America

Scientists say there is growing evidence of a link to microcephaly, that leads to babies being born with small heads

Can lead to fever and a rash but most people show no symptoms, and there is no known cure

Only way to fight Zika is to clear stagnant water where mosquitoes breed, and protect against mosquito bites

People in the Western World need to know what’s happening here in West Africa. THEY ARE LYING!!! “Ebola” as a virus does NOT Exist and is NOT “Spread”. The Red Cross has brought a disease to 4 specific countries for 4 specific reasons and it is only contracted by those who receive treatments and injections from the Red Cross. That is why Liberians and Nigerians have begun kicking the Red Cross out of their countries and reporting in the news the truth. Now bear with me:

REASONS:

Most people jump to “depopulation” which is no doubt always on the mind of the West when it comes to Africa. But I assure you Africa can NEVER be depopulated by killing 160 people a day when thousands are born per day. So the real reasons are much more tangible.

Reason 1: This vaccine implemented sickness being “called” Ebola was introduced into West Africa for the end goal of getting troops on the ground in Nigeria, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. If you remember America was just trying to get into Nigeria for “Boko Haram” #BULLSHIT but that fell apart when Nigerians started telling the truth. There ARE NO GIRLS MISSING. Global support fell through the floor, and a new reason was needed to get troops into Nigeria and steal the new oil reserves they have discovered.

Reason 2: Sierra Leone is the World’s Largest Supplier of Diamonds. For the past 4 months they have been on strike, refusing to provide diamonds due to horrible working conditions and slave pay. The West will not pay a fair wage for the resources because the idea is to keep these people surviving on rice bags and foreign aid so that they remain a source of cheap slave labor forever. A reason was also needed to get troops on the ground in Sierra Leone to force an end to the diamond miners strikes. This is not the first time this has been done. When miners refuse to work troops are sent in and even if they have to kill and replace them all, the only desire is to get diamonds back flowing out of the country.

Of course to launch multiple campaigns to invade these countries separately would be way too fishy. But something like “Ebola” allows access to an entire area simultaneously…

Reason 3: In addition to stealing Nigerian oil, and forcing Sierra Leone back to mining, troops have also been sent in to FORCE vaccinations (Deadly “Ebola” Poison) onto those Africans who are not foolish enough to take them willingly.

3000 troops are being sent in to make sure that this “poison” continues to spread, because again it is only spread through vaccination. As more and more news articles are released as they have been in Liberia, informing the populous of the US lies and manipulation, more and more Africans are refusing to visit the Red Cross. Troops will force these vaccinations upon the people to ensure the visible appearance of an Ebola pandemic. In addition to this they will protect the Red Cross from the Liberians and Nigerians who have been rightfully ejecting them from their countries.

Reason 4: Last but not least, the APPEARANCE of this Ebola “pandemic” (should Americans not catch on) will be used to scare the countless millions into taking an “Ebola vaccine” which in reality is the pandemic. Already they have started with stories of how it has been brought to the U.S. and has appeared in Dallas, how white doctors were cured but black infected are not being allowed to be treated, etc.

ALL that will do is make blacks STRIVE to get the vaccine, because it appears that the “cure” is being held back from blacks. They will run out in droves to get it and then there will be serious problems. With all we have seen revealed about vaccines this year you would think we learned our lesson. All I can do is hope so, Because they rely on our ignorance to complete their agendas.

Ask yourself: If Ebola really was spread from person to person, instead of controlled spread through vaccination – then WHY would the CDC and the US Government continue to allow flights in and out of these countries with absolutely no regulation, Or At All? We have got to start thinking and sharing information globally because they do not give the true perspective of the people who live here in West Africa. They are lying for their own benefit and there aren’t enough voices out there with a platform to help share our reality. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, paralyzed and disabled by these and other “new” vaccines all over the world and we are finally becoming aware of it. Now what will we do with all this information?

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

Islamic State militants have released footage claiming to show the beheading of British hostage David Haines.

The aid worker, 44, was captured by ISIS in Syria in March 2013.

The plight of the dad-of-two was revealed when he appeared at the end of a video showing the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month.

ISIS had threatened to kill Mr Haines if world leaders do not bow to their demands.

Tonight, the extremists posted a new video lasting 2minutes and 30 seconds which appears to show the beheading of David Haines.

The Prime Minister rushed back to Downing Street from a society wedding in Hampshire and will chair an emergency meeting of COBRA on Sunday morning.

He condemned the murder of David Haines as ""an act of pure evil"".

The Prime Minister said: ""This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil.

""My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""

He was joined by the the leader of the opposition Ed Miliband who said: ""I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.""

President Barack Obama also condemned the murder and promised the United States would ""destroy"" ISIS.

President Obama said in a statement: ""The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL (ISIS).

""Our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

""The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve.

""We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.""

The new execution video begins with a news clip of David Cameron talking about Britain's policy towards ""this appalling organisation"".

This fades out before text appears which reads: ""A message to the allies of America"".

The video then shows a man, believed to be David Haines, on his knees in an orange jumpsuit with his hands handcuffed behind his back.

An Islamic militant - believed to be the infamous Jihadi John - stands behind him holding a knife.

The man believed to be David Haines speaks first, saying: ""My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.

""You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did following a trend amongst our British Prime Minsters who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans'

""Unfortunately it is we the British public who will pay the price for our parliament's selfish decisions.""

The man believed to be Jihadi John then says: ""This British man has to the pay the price for your promise Cameron to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State ironically he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

""Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction and playing the role of the obedient lapdog Cameron will only drag you and your people into another bloody and un-winable war.

The footage then shows what is believed to be the dead body of Mr Haines.

Another British hostage is then paraded to the camera.

Jihadi John says: ""If you, Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State then you like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands.""

Before tonight's video, ISIS militants had not responded to attempts made by David Haines' family to make contact.

Mr Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He has a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana who described him as a ""fantastic man and father"".

Mr Haines was taken while working for ACTED, having previously helped people in Libya and South Sudan.

Militants from IS have beheaded two American journalists, Jim Foley and Sotloff, posting the evidence online in gruesome videos featuring a masked jihadist with a British accent.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said the FCO will be doing ""everything"" they could to protect Mr Haines.

Educated at Perth Academy secondary school, he has worked for aid agencies in some of the world's worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world.",5229

On Thursday morning, gunfire was allegedly heard near Charles-de-Gaulle Airport in Paris, according to an unconfirmed report from the Air News agency. Other reports add that police have closed in on the suspects some eight miles from the airport. The airport has been partially closed while police conduct attempt to apprehend the terror suspects.

Two of four runways have been closed at the airport as the operation to neutralize the Paris shooting suspects is underway, reported the media. Planes cross the Dammartin-en-Goele commune while approaching CDG airport.

The suspects are holding one hostage, police sources told AFP.

The Charles de Gaulle School in Dammartin-en-Goele is under lockdown as police have surrounded the town. Pupils were instructed to stay away from windows, said a high school student in Figaro.

""Some students are crying,"" said another, adding that her friend was ""terrified.""

France's interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve confirmed an operation to detain suspects was underway northeast of Paris. Security teams are being mobilized in Dammartin-en-Goele, he added.

We have indications that the terrorists are within our perimeter,” said Cazeneuve. ""The national police and the gendarmerie are working to locate them.”

""Police forces are in place and the operation is being conducted minute by minute, led by the director general of the gendarmerie and the national police, the counter terror authorities and the Interior Ministry,” he added.

Several schools, located close to the printing house where the suspects have been surrounded, have been evacuated, French media reported.

The Henri Dunant primary school is only 300 meters from the printing facility.

At least four French Air Force helicopters have landed nearby, reports say.

Cazeneuve confirmed that the kidnappers are the Kouachi brothers, who are said to be heavily armed, RTL reported from the scene.The brothers are holding one female hostage, reported iTele.

Yves Albarello , the deputy of Seine-et-Marne department, said the Kouachis ""are ready to die as martyrs,” Le Figaro cites.

Despite the threat, French PM Manuel Valls stressed that his country is ""at war against terrorism, not against religion.”

After some 90,000 thousand security forces were mobilized nationwide, the manhunt to capture the suspects in the worst terrorist attack to strike France in a generation may be coming to a head.

Reports have flooded French media about shots being fired in a number of localities, including the Seine-et-Marne area in northeastern France. Earlier on Thursday, the suspects had reportedly stolen a Peugeot in the morning in the town of Montagny, which is about 50 kilometers northeast of Paris.

RTL reports that at least two people have been seriously injured in the course of events, though it remains unclear if it happened during or before the hostage-taking in Dammartin-en-Goele, a commune located 22 miles northeast of Paris.

“I am [in] Dammartin-en-Goêle,” wrote one Twitter user. “All the exits to the village are blocked. The police brigades are here. And 5 helicopters.”

The Paris prosecutor’s office, however, has denied reports by several French media outlets that there were casualties in the shootout in northeast Paris.

The hospitals in Dammartin-en-Goele are on high alert, and they are ready to receive patients in case any causalities result from the police operation.

The suspects are later reported to have taken hostages at Création Tendance Découverte, a small company of about five employees, the city mayor said at a press conference. Police would later pursue the suspects down the N2 highway, which passes near the airport.

Cherif and Said Kouachi, are accused of killing 12 people in Wednesday's attack on the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo. The magazine had repeatedly lampooned religious and political figures, including the Prophet Mohammed. The shooting was France's deadliest attack in over 50 years.

692046121250586624,non-rumor,Wind and solar could power most of the U.S. by 2030 without raising electricity prices https://t.co/lVnfJ20yZd https://t.co/Q3rGBo6YaI,http://bit.ly/1Qq2sJP,True,Switch to Clean Energy Can Be Fast and Cheap,"Wind and sunshine could power most of the United States by 2030 without raising electricity prices, according to a new study from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Even when optimizing to cut costs and limiting themselves to existing technology, scientists showed that renewables can meet energy demands and slash carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector by 80 percent below 1990 levels.

The study, published yesterday in the journal Nature Climate Change, factors in energy demand, costs and, crucially, the role of weather.

Co-author Alexander MacDonald, outgoing head of the American Meteorological Society and recently retired from NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory, said the study sprang from discussions he had at the 2009 U.N. climate change summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.

“Basically, it was really clear that nobody has really looked at the importance of weather for wind and solar energy,” he said.

When clouds float overhead, gales slow to a breeze or both, solar panels and wind turbines slow their electricity production, forcing other generators to step up to meet demand.

However, MacDonald reasoned that over larger geographic regions, weather tends to average out, so spreading out renewables and channeling electricity accordingly could better smooth over peaks and valleys in electricity output.

“You really want to get an area big enough that, when wind isn’t blowing in part of it, it’s blowing in another part,” MacDonald said.

Pennies per kilowatt-hour

To answer the question of whether renewables could be a cost-effective energy solution, NOAA and University of Colorado scientists played to their strengths in weather analysis.

“NOAA has some of the best weather data around the world to look at this problem,” said Christopher Clack, a co-lead author and research scientist at the University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences.

MacDonald, Clack and their collaborators developed a simulation called the National Electricity With Weather System (NEWS). The model incorporates weather and electricity demand in 60-minute increments over 13-kilometer blocks in the 48 contiguous states.

The model held nuclear and hydropower at 2012 levels, included land-use restrictions and demand growth, and projected energy production costs out to 2030, including production and transmission.

With an objective of reducing costs, researchers found that onshore wind and solar power could meet electricity demands at a levelized cost of energy comparable to 2012 levels, roughly 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.

In a scenario where renewables were more expensive than current projections, the model created an energy system in 2030 that cut emissions 33 percent below 1990 levels while producing electricity at 8.6 cents per kWh.

A scenario where renewable energy prices dropped and natural gas prices rose created a system producing electricity at 10 cents per kWh and cutting emissions by 78 percent.

As renewable energy takes up a larger share of the generation mix, large-scale weather effects end up reducing intermittency.

This challenges assumptions that more renewables on the grid would require more dispatchable generators like natural-gas-fired turbines or energy storage, both costly options for utilities.

Not waiting for a breakthrough

The NEWS model found that energy storage would not be cost-effective at current prices.

However, the Department of Energy earlier this month cast a ballot in favor of the conventional wisdom, issuing $18 million in funding for solar energy and storage research for utilities (ClimateWire, Jan. 20).

Representatives from the Edison Electric Institute and Electric Power Research Institute did not respond to requests for comment, citing weather-related office closures.

MacDonald and Clack said the key enabler for their high renewable energy penetration scenarios is high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission. Photovoltaics and wind turbines often generate direct-current electricity, so transmitting in direct current removes a conversion step that costs money and saps power.

HVDC transmission lines also have fewer losses over long distances than alternating-current transmission. The authors envision an HVDC network across the United States akin to the interstate highway system, shunting power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed in a national electricity market.

In the model, transmission made up 4 percent of final electricity costs.

The study joins a growing suite of work finding that high renewable energy penetration is feasible in the United States (ClimateWire, June 10, 2015). Other studies have also found that energy storage isn’t the gatekeeper for drastically more wind and solar power on the grid (ClimateWire, Sept. 28, 2015).

MacDonald said this study is unique because it isn’t betting on a technology breakthrough and it sets its sights on 2030, while other studies set 2050 as the finish line.

“We’ll have doubled the CO 2 by then in the air,” he said.

364589696573124609,false,FUKUSHIMA: HIGHLY RADIOACTIVE WATER SEEPING INTO THE OCEAN http://t.co/KrOuYaq4Go,http://reut.rs/16w6oCO,True,Exclusive: Japan nuclear body says radioactive water at Fukushima an 'emergency',"TOKYO (Reuters) - Highly radioactive water seeping into the ocean from Japan’s crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is creating an “emergency” that the operator is struggling to contain, an official from the country’s nuclear watchdog said on Monday.

This contaminated groundwater has breached an underground barrier, is rising toward the surface and is exceeding legal limits of radioactive discharge, Shinji Kinjo, head of a Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) task force, told Reuters.

Countermeasures planned by Tokyo Electric Power Co are only a temporary solution, he said.

Tepco’s “sense of crisis is weak,” Kinjo said. “This is why you can’t just leave it up to Tepco alone” to grapple with the ongoing disaster.

“Right now, we have an emergency,” he said.

Tepco has been widely castigated for its failure to prepare for the massive 2011 tsunami and earthquake that devastated its Fukushima plant and lambasted for its inept response to the reactor meltdowns. It has also been accused of covering up shortcomings.

It was not immediately clear how much of a threat the contaminated groundwater could pose. In the early weeks of the disaster, the Japanese government allowed Tepco to dump tens of thousands of metric tons of contaminated water into the Pacific in an emergency move.

The toxic water release was however heavily criticized by neighboring countries as well as local fishermen and the utility has since promised it would not dump irradiated water without the consent of local townships.

“Until we know the exact density and volume of the water that’s flowing out, I honestly can’t speculate on the impact on the sea,” said Mitsuo Uematsu from the Center for International Collaboration, Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at the University of Tokyo.

“We also should check what the levels are like in the sea water. If it’s only inside the port and it’s not flowing out into the sea, it may not spread as widely as some fear.”

NO OTHER OUTLET FOR WATER

Tepco said it is taking various measures to prevent contaminated water from leaking into the bay near the plant. In an e-mailed statement to Reuters, a company spokesman said Tepco deeply apologized to residents in Fukushima prefecture, the surrounding region and the larger public for causing inconveniences, worries and trouble.

The utility pumps out some 400 metric tons a day of groundwater flowing from the hills above the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the basements of the destroyed buildings, which mixes with highly irradiated water that is used to cool the reactors in a stable state below 100 degrees Celsius.

Tepco is trying to prevent groundwater from reaching the plant by building a “bypass” but recent spikes of radioactive elements in sea water has prompted the utility to reverse months of denials and finally admit that tainted water is reaching the sea.

In a bid to prevent more leaks into the bay of the Pacific Ocean, plant workers created the underground barrier by injecting chemicals to harden the ground along the shoreline of the No. 1 reactor building. But that barrier is only effective in solidifying the ground at least 1.8 meters below the surface.

By breaching the barrier, the water can seep through the shallow areas of earth into the nearby sea. More seriously, it is rising toward the surface - a break of which would accelerate the outflow.

“If you build a wall, of course the water is going to accumulate there. And there is no other way for the water to go but up or sideways and eventually lead to the ocean,” said Masashi Goto, a retired Toshiba Corp nuclear engineer who worked on several Tepco plants. “So now, the question is how long do we have?”

Contaminated water could rise to the ground’s surface within three weeks, the Asahi Shimbun said on Saturday. Kinjo said the three-week timeline was not based on NRA’s calculations but acknowledged that if the water reaches the surface, “it would flow extremely fast.”

A Tepco official said on Monday the company plans to start pumping out a further 100 metric tons of groundwater a day around the end of the week.

The regulatory task force overseeing accident measures of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, which met Friday, “concluded that new measures are needed to stop the water from flowing into the sea that way,” Kinjo said.

Tepco said on Friday that a cumulative 20 trillion to 40 trillion becquerels of radioactive tritium had probably leaked into the sea since the disaster. The company said this was within legal limits.

Tritium is far less harmful than cesium and strontium, which have also been released from the plant. Tepco is scheduled to test strontium levels next.

The admission on the long-term tritium leaks, as well as renewed criticism from the regulator, show the precarious state of the $11 billion cleanup and Tepco’s challenge to fix a fundamental problem: How to prevent water, tainted with radioactive elements like cesium, from flowing into the ocean.

Omar Mateen pictured when he was a freshman at high school in 2001. Former elementary school classmates have revealed he once threatened to go on a shooting spree at the school

Orlando gunman Omar Mateen threatened to bring a gun into his elementary school and kill everyone when he was just 10 years old, a former classmate has claimed.

Mateen, 29, was shot dead in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Sunday morning after opening fire inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more.

Now classmates who attended the same school as the shooter in Port Lucie have claimed that teachers often had to deal with his unruly behavior and threats of violence against other pupils.

The claims come just a day after classmates at his high school said that Mateen openly cheered on 9/11 as they watched in horror as two hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York.

Lesley Hall, who was a 5th grade classmate of Mateen at Marisopa Elementary School in Florida told TMZ she recalls one occasion where he threatened to go on a shooting spree.

She explained that he told a group of children that he planned to bring a weapon into the school and open fire, killing everyone.

Ms Hall added that when students told teachers at the school about the threats, they were taken extremely seriously and Mateen was suspended for two weeks.

The former classmate also claimed she lived in constant fear of Mateen due to his relentless bullying of her, and even in middle school, he threw chair and spat at teachers.

The school district have so far refused to comment on the claims.

They come after reports that while Mateen was a sophomore in high school, attending a Spectrum Alternative School, a school for students with poor grades or behavioral issues, he cheered during the 9/11 attacks.

According to the Washington Post, Mateen's class was watching broadcast video of the first plane hitting one of the towers that morning when the second plane hit on live TV.

After the second plane hit, a former classmate recalls that Mateen 'stood up in class and...started jumping up-and-down cheering on the terrorist'.

Classmates say Mateen threatened to bring a gun and shoot everyone while attending Marisopa Elementary School in Port Lucie, Florida

'Mateen was smiling. It was almost like surreal how happy he was about what happened to us,' the student recalls.

The former student, who spoke anonymously to the Post for fear of his business clients learning that he attended an alternative school, said Mateen also claimed that Osama bin Laden was his uncle.

Another former classmate told the Post that Mateen started misbehaving after the two towers were hit, and that he was sent to the dean's office.

'I was sleeping in class and woke up to see people jumping off buildings, so I started swearing and they sent me up,' the former student said. 'But Omar was saying some really rude stuff. Stuff like, ""That's what America deserves."" That kind of thing. It wasn't right.'

Robert Zirkle, who was a freshman at Martin County High School at the time but who rode the same bus as the shooter, says that Mateen began taunting other students on the ride by making plane noises.

Mateen, 29, was shot dead in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Sunday morning after opening fire inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and injuring dozens more

Zirkle says he believes Mateen was suspended or expelled from his school shortly after 9/11.

On the day of 9/11 itself, another student recalls seeing Mateen's father pick him up from school and slap him across the face in public.

'They had to escort him out of the school,' Zirkle said. 'Other kids were trying to fight him. A couple days after, they had to take him off the bus.'

'A few of my friends wanted to fight him because he kept doing it and saying crazy things,' he added. 'It's weird. He was totally cool before 9/11, and then something changed.'

Mateen's lasting fascination with terrorists was obvious when he called 911 from inside the Pulse nightclub on Sunday.

FBI Director James Comey said in a statement on Monday that the shooter was involved in precisely three calls to a 911 dispatcher at approximately 2:30am.

Comey said: 'He (Mateen) called and hung up. He called again and spoke with the dispatcher and hung up.

'And the dispatcher called him back and they spoke briefly.

'During the calls he said he was doing this for the leader of ISIS, who he named, and pledged loyalty to.

'But he also appeared to claim solidarity with the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombings and solidarity with the Florida man who died as a suicideb bomber in Syria for Al-Nusra Front - a group in conflict with the so-called Islamic State.",5177

Vickers, 58, a native of Miramichi, N.B., was reportedly in the House of Commons when a gunman entered sometime after 9:52 a.m.

Two sources told The Canadian Press that Vickers shot the assailant inside the Hall of Honour, the main entrance to the Centre Block beneath the Peace Tower.

Officials have not confirmed that Vickers fired at the suspect, but multiple MPs credited Vickers on Twitter with helping to stop the attacker.

MPs tweet thanks

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives:

""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms."" —New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe."" —Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino.

""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes."" —Justice Minister Peter MacKay.

""Kevin Vickers is such a fine man. His actions today are no surprise. Proud to call him a friend."" —Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.

Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security that included protecting foreign dignitaries and members of the Royal Family.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick. Before his appointment as sergeant-of-arms, Vickers was director of security operations for the House of Commons.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament Buildings.

'You don't want to mess with him'

Vickers's brother John, who lives in Victoria, told CBC News Wednesday that his brother called their mother, Monica, at her New Brunswick home shortly after the incident to tell her he is safe.

""I just couldn't be prouder of him right now,"" John said, adding that his brother has ""always been committed to service, people and country.""

When asked about Vickers’s reported heroics, his cousin Keith said “It’s Kevin being Kevin.”

“He’s a very intelligent and responsible person. He’s a people person-type fellow, too, but you don’t want to mess with him,” said Keith. “All the boys, the local guys, they’ll be quite proud to hear he did what he did.”

According to Keith, Vickers’s son is currently a police officer with the local force in Miramichi.

Dan Bussières, the current sergeant-at-arms in the New Brunswick Legislature and Vickers’s colleague in the RCMP for many years, called him “a true gentleman who is very responsible.”

“He’s the perfect man to be the sergeant-at-arms in Ottawa right now. I can assure you of that,” Bussières said.

Prior to his appointment in the House of Commons, Vickers worked as an aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's former lieutenant-governor, Marilyn Trenholme Counsell.

Vickers served under Trenholme Counsell for four years starting in 1999. She watched closely Wednesday as reports came in about the shootings in Ottawa and news that Vickers may have played a central role in the events.

Trenholme Counsell said she was not surprised to learn of his possible involvement.

""Not at all, it's so much in his character to take charge of something and do what has to be done,"" she said from her home as TV news reports played in the background.

""He is fearless in the face of a challenge. It didn't surprise me that he acted.""

As an RCMP officer, Vickers was responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

He is a recipient of the Queen's Jubilee medal, the Canada 125 medal and the RCMP Long Service medal.

Former RCMP deputy commissioner Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who has also served as a security chief on Parliament Hill, called Vickers a ""natural planner"" and said his former RCMP colleague has always ""had a contingency plan.""

""He actually did mock-up scenarios for the personnel ... very much like what happened today,"" Bourdas said. ""Knowing Kevin the way I do, he is very troubled by this chain of events.""

Sergeant-at-arms 1st line of safety

Although sergeants-at-arms often operate outside of the public spotlight, the events on Parliament Hill are not the first time they have been instrumental in preventing bloodshed in Canadian history.

When army supply clerk Denis Lortie opened fire in Quebec's National Assembly in 1984, the legislature's sergeant-at-arms went into the chamber and tried to calm him.

Rene Jalbert, a retired major in the army, offered Lortie a cigarette and eventually persuaded him to release about a dozen hostages who were cowering in the chamber.

The legislature was minutes away from convening when Lortie entered the building through a side door carrying two submachine guns, and at one point sat in the Speaker's chair firing wildly. He killed three people and wounded 13 others.

""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe."" —Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino.

""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes."" —Justice Minister Peter MacKay.

""Kevin Vickers is such a fine man. His actions today are no surprise. Proud to call him a friend."" —Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.

Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security that included protecting foreign dignitaries and members of the Royal Family.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick. Before his appointment as sergeant-of-arms, Vickers was director of security operations for the House of Commons.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament Buildings.

'You don't want to mess with him'

Vickers's brother John, who lives in Victoria, told CBC News Wednesday that his brother called their mother, Monica, at her New Brunswick home shortly after the incident to tell her he is safe.

""I just couldn't be prouder of him right now,"" John said, adding that his brother has ""always been committed to service, people and country.""

When asked about Vickers’s reported heroics, his cousin Keith said “It’s Kevin being Kevin.”

“He’s a very intelligent and responsible person. He’s a people person-type fellow, too, but you don’t want to mess with him,” said Keith. “All the boys, the local guys, they’ll be quite proud to hear he did what he did.”

According to Keith, Vickers’s son is currently a police officer with the local force in Miramichi.

Dan Bussières, the current sergeant-at-arms in the New Brunswick Legislature and Vickers’s colleague in the RCMP for many years, called him “a true gentleman who is very responsible.”

“He’s the perfect man to be the sergeant-at-arms in Ottawa right now. I can assure you of that,” Bussières said.

Prior to his appointment in the House of Commons, Vickers worked as an aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's former lieutenant-governor, Marilyn Trenholme Counsell.

Vickers served under Trenholme Counsell for four years starting in 1999. She watched closely Wednesday as reports came in about the shootings in Ottawa and news that Vickers may have played a central role in the events.

Trenholme Counsell said she was not surprised to learn of his possible involvement.

""Not at all, it's so much in his character to take charge of something and do what has to be done,"" she said from her home as TV news reports played in the background.

""He is fearless in the face of a challenge. It didn't surprise me that he acted.""

As an RCMP officer, Vickers was responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

He is a recipient of the Queen's Jubilee medal, the Canada 125 medal and the RCMP Long Service medal.

Former RCMP deputy commissioner Pierre-Yves Bourduas, who has also served as a security chief on Parliament Hill, called Vickers a ""natural planner"" and said his former RCMP colleague has always ""had a contingency plan.""

""He actually did mock-up scenarios for the personnel ... very much like what happened today,"" Bourdas said. ""Knowing Kevin the way I do, he is very troubled by this chain of events.""

Sergeant-at-arms 1st line of safety

Although sergeants-at-arms often operate outside of the public spotlight, the events on Parliament Hill are not the first time they have been instrumental in preventing bloodshed in Canadian history.

When army supply clerk Denis Lortie opened fire in Quebec's National Assembly in 1984, the legislature's sergeant-at-arms went into the chamber and tried to calm him.

Rene Jalbert, a retired major in the army, offered Lortie a cigarette and eventually persuaded him to release about a dozen hostages who were cowering in the chamber.

The legislature was minutes away from convening when Lortie entered the building through a side door carrying two submachine guns, and at one point sat in the Speaker's chair firing wildly. He killed three people and wounded 13 others.

When a celebrity dies, the online community divides into two distinct camps: the oversharing, sincere mourners and the blatantly insensitive amateur comedians. The first camp doesn’t even need to be intimately familiar with the deceased. A tweet or post could simply say, “I watched him or her in some of my favorite films, TV shows, and YouTube videos, and I will miss his or her singular contribution to my life.” The second camp makes some crass joke to prove how edgy they are, while also revealing they are incapable of the simple human emotion of empathy. These jokes can come from anyone, but usually come from short, bald, ugly men who’d chop their own dicks off for a retweet from Howard Stern.

When news hit yesterday that Fast & Furious star Paul Walker had passed away in a car accident, the cycle of acceptance and annoyance began yet again. Here's a sampling of the reaction, both heartfelt and genuinely stupid.

I understand people should care about the driver that died also, but he was the DRIVER of the car that LOST CONTROL and killed PAUL WALKER — Mike Wyatt (@HashtagMikeDubz) December 1, 2013

That last one is my favorite of the bunch, because it's in direct opposition to a movement that coalesced rather quickly around the man who was identified as the driver of the car that Paul perished in, Roger Rodas. It's become a meme in and of itself to attempt to draw attention to the lesser-known person in the car.

RiP Roger Rodas. Aka the guy driving the car with Paul Walker in the passenger seat. The guy who isn't recognized because he wasn't famous. — Unsober Girl (@unsobergirl) December 1, 2013

It seems like kind of a stretch to say no one cares about Roger Rodas, since his friends and family probably care quite a bit. You can't really blame the media for not running a story with the headline, “Custom Car Company CEO Dies in Car Accident with Celebrity in Passenger Seat.” If I died in a plane crash and Jaden Smith was sitting next to me, I would totally understand if Jaden got all the press coverage. Misplaced righteous indignation like this is pretty bad, but unsubtle insults are a lot worse.

Paul Walker may have been an average actor, but he was one of the most charitable guys in real life and should not be forgotten. — UWMadisonConfessions (@UWConfessions) December 1, 2013

The first rule of the internet is to never pass up an opportunity to mock a dead person for his or her perceived shortcomings. When Dane Cook dies, will someone say, “He was a terrible comedian, and I couldn't stand to hear his voice, but he had a really firm handshake and for that, we should be sad?”

RIP to #Virgo Paul Walker! He was born on September 12. At his best, he was encouraging, fearless, optimistic. — The12Signs (@The12Signs) December 1, 2013

Did you know that Paul Walker was a Virgo? Does it fucking matter? I feel like this Twitter account is only a few stiff drinks away from saying, “If Paul Walker had checked his horoscope yesterday, he'd still be here, so be sure to come back here often... OR ELSE.”

Paul walker was too hot to die — Parin ❁ॐ❁ (@parin_r) December 1, 2013

And finally, we get to the crux of the matter. Some people are just too beautiful for this world and should be spared the harsh inevitability of mortality.

The internet allows the world to have a massive funeral for those that we've welcomed into our lives through popular culture. Of course, every funeral I've been to has turned into the sort of cringe-inducing shit-show that you find online. People say inappropriate things, use the occassion for their own benefit, and sometimes forget the real reason why they're there in the first place. In the middle of all that is legitimate grief though, and while we sift through the bad taste, it's important to remember that this famous guy was a very real person, and there are people that are still living that wish they could hear their friend's voice one last time.",5158
532928419051622400,unverified,Islamic State releases audio it says is of leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi days after reports he was killed or injured  http://t.co/EyWb7ZYL8M,http://bbc.in/1Bh2krx,True,Islamic State: 'Baghdadi message' issued by jihadists,"Image copyright AP Image caption Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has rarely appeared in public

Islamic State has released an audiotape it says was recorded by its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, days after reports that he had been killed or injured.

In the recording, released via social media, the speaker says IS fighters will never stop fighting ""even if only one soldier remains"".

Correspondents say the recording appears authentic and recent.

BBC analysts say the message is probably also intended to counter the claim that Baghdadi has been killed.

The IS leader was said to have been caught in a US-led air strike near the Iraqi city of Mosul last week.

Thursday's 17-minute recording makes no direct reference to that air strike, but does mention some developments that have occurred since then.

An English transcript of the recording was also released.

Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the US-led coalition fighting IS was making progress, but must ""prepare for a long and difficult struggle"".

Image copyright AP Image caption Islamic State has a reputation for brutality in the territory it controls

The IS audiotape mentions US President Barack's Obama decision to deploy an extra 1,500 troops to Iraq - a move announced shortly after the air strike on Mosul.

BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says the tone of the recording is characteristically defiant and incendiary, and the cadences and language do sound like those of the Islamic State leader.

The recording calls on IS supporters to ""erupt volcanoes of jihad"" across the world.

He disparages opponents of IS as ""Jews, Crusaders, apostates... [and] devils"", and says the US and its allies ""are terrified, weak and powerless"".

The recording also calls for attacks in Saudi Arabia - describing Saudi leaders as ""the head of the snake"" - and says that the US-led military campaign in Syria and Iraq is failing.

Gulf state rulers, who have joined the US-led coalition against IS, are described as ""treacherous"".

Analysis: BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner

All week rumours have swirled around the status of Islamic State's elusive leader. Within hours of new, unsubstantiated claims on Thursday that he had died, an audio message emerged purporting to be from him, promising an expansion of IS's campaign into new countries. It calls for attacks on the ""'Land of the Two Holy Mosques"", meaning Saudi Arabia, listing Shia Muslims as the top target.

It mentions new oaths of allegiance from jihadists in Egypt, Algeria and Libya and mocks the announcement of 1,500 additional US military advisers in Iraq, saying US-led air strikes had failed to stop the advance of Islamic State.

In fact the airstrikes have done exactly that in military terms, driving IS fighters off key dams, but there is no denying the spread of IS's popularity among violent extremists across the Middle East and even in Europe.

What is Islamic State?

Profile: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

The recording also refers to new pledges of allegiance from jihadist groups in Libya, Egypt and Yemen that occurred in recent days.

""O soldiers of the Islamic State... erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. Light the earth with fire against all dictators,"" the voice on the recording says.

In Washington on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress that there had been ""steady and sustainable progress"" against IS.

In contrast to the audio messaging disparaging the coalition efforts, Mr Hagel said US-led air strikes had helped in ""degrading and destroying Isil's [IS] war fighting capacity and in denying safe haven to its fighters"".

""Directly and through support of Iraqi forces, coalition air strikes have hit Isil's command and control, its leadership, its revenue sources... and impaired its ability to amass forces,"" he added.

'IS coins'

The self-styled Islamic State - a jihadist group also known as Isis, or Isil - has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq since June, declaring a caliphate over territory it controls.

It emerged on Thursday that the group has reportedly announced plans to mint its own gold, silver and copper coins.

A statement posted on jihadist sites, which could not be independently verified, said the coins were to be used in IS-controlled areas.

The statement said this would counter ""the tyrannical currency system that was imposed on the Muslims"" - thought to be a reference to the US dollar.

Mass killings

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself is a shadowy figure who only showed himself publicly for the first time in a video released in July, when he delivered a sermon in Mosul, Iraq.

He claims lineage from the family and tribe of the Prophet Muhammad.

Although currently limited to Iraq and Syria, IS has promised to ""break the borders"" of Jordan and Lebanon and to ""free Palestine"".

The group has attracted support from extremists around the world and demands that all swear allegiance to its leader.

Its brutal tactics - including mass killings and the beheadings of soldiers and journalists - have sparked fear and outrage across the world, including from Muslim groups.

Nigeria's military says it has agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram - and that the schoolgirls the group has abducted will be released.

Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Alex Badeh, announced the truce. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group has been fighting an insurgency since 2009, with some 2,000 civilians reportedly killed this year.

Boko Haram sparked global outrage six months ago by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls.

The girls were seized in the north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state, and their continued captivity has led to criticism of the Nigerian government's efforts to secure their release.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign said in a tweet on Friday: ""We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.""

'Cautiously optimistic'

Air Chief Marshal Badeh revealed the truce at the close of a three-day security meeting between Nigeria and Cameroon. He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement.

Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad.

As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group.

Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" he said. ""I am cautiously optimistic.""

He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena.

The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja.

Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make.

""We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,"" he said.

Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos

Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development.

If this turns out to be true it will be some of the best news Nigerians have heard for decades.

Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement, especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists.

Some question whether the announcement was in any way timed to coincide with the imminent announcement that President Goodluck Jonathan is going to run for re-election.

The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground.

So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it ""haram"", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture.

Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014.

Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon.

Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying.

In July, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger agreed to form a 2,800-strong regional force to tackle Boko Haram militants.",5126

(2:08)

Detroit Lions star receiver Calvin Johnson told his family and a close circle of friends before the past season that 2015-16 would be his final season in the NFL. He delivered the same message to coach Jim Caldwell the day after the regular season ended, sources told ESPN.

Caldwell told Johnson not to rush his decision and to take his time, sources told ESPN. Out of respect to Caldwell, Johnson agreed to do just that, according to sources.

The Lions have not given up hope that Johnson will change his mind, but one person who knows Johnson well said, ""He's pretty content with his decision.""

After nine seasons in the NFL, Johnson's body is beaten down. The five-time Pro Bowler has battled lingering ankle injuries and general body soreness to the point that it would be difficult for him to return for another season, during which he would turn 31 years old.

Johnson's body has been so sore and his conviction so strong that he shared his decision to retire after the 2015 season with only two teammates -- quarterback Matthew Stafford and linebacker Stephen Tulloch -- with the request that they keep it confidential, according to sources.

Editor's Picks Rothstein: If Megatron gone, Jeffery possible? If Calvin Johnson follows through on his talk of retirement, Alshon Jeffery might be one of the free agents the Lions target, Michael Rothstein writes.

Verlander, Peterson tweet regards to Megatron Justin Verlander and Patrick Peterson were just two of the Calvin Johnson fans who took time to send regards after news broke that Megatron was telling people that 2015 would be his last season, Michael Rothstein writes. 1 Related

Stafford and Tulloch honored the request, and the rest of the Lions organization did not learn of Johnson's plans to retire until after this season, according to sources. At that time, the Lions issued a statement from Johnson that said, ""Like many players at this stage of their career, I am currently evaluating options for my future. I would expect to have a decision regarding this matter in the not-too-distant future.""

The Lions, in turn, said they have ""profound respect for Calvin and certainly understand and appreciate his decision to give proper thought and consideration to his football future.""

The Lions released another statement Sunday night that said, ""Regarding today's ESPN report, we stand by our statement issued on Jan. 6 regarding Calvin.""

But unless Johnson has the change of heart the Lions still hope for (but not many expect), one of the greatest players in Detroit franchise history is likely to walk away from the game.

Lions defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, speaking after Sunday's Pro Bowl in Hawaii, said he hopes Johnson returns for one more year.

""I would love to see him back, but it's his decision to make,"" Ansah said. ""He's a great guy who has a lot of respect for the game. ... He's a professional, and he's somebody that I look up to.

""Whatever decision he's gonna make, I'm gonna support him, and I'm glad to call him my teammate.""

Some of Johnson's teammates used their social media accounts to salute him Sunday.

Johnson played in all 16 games this past season and hauled in 88 receptions for 1,214 yards and nine touchdowns. It was his sixth consecutive 1,000-yard season and the seventh of his career.

The No. 2 overall pick in the 2007 draft, Johnson had his best year in 2012, when he set the NFL single-season record with 1,964 receiving yards. He is the Lions' all-time franchise leader in receptions (731) and receiving yards (11,619).

The Lions have made the playoffs twice during Johnson's nine-year career but have posted losing records in the other seven seasons, including their 7-9 mark in 2015.

""He's a winner,"" Vikings running back Adrian Peterson said after the Pro Bowl. ""When he goes out there and plays, he's putting everything on the line and giving his best effort.

""I don't know how many times they've been in the playoffs since he's been in the league, and whether or not that factors in [his decision]. But I know he has a lot of football left in him.""

Raiders rookie Pro Bowl receiver Amari Cooper, who was 13 years old during Johnson's rookie season in 2007, said he was ""kind of sad"" when he heard about Johnson's potential retirement.

""You never want to see the greats leave the game,"" Cooper said. ""You feel like they're going to be making plays forever. You want to be like them growing up, and you still want to see them make plays.""",5109

Security forces have ended a gun and bomb attack on a university in north-west Pakistan in which 19 people were killed and 17 injured.

Four suspected attackers also died in a battle that lasted nearly three hours at Bacha Khan University in Charsadda.

One Pakistani Taliban commander said the group had carried out the assault, but its main spokesman denied this.

The group killed 130 students at a school in the city of Peshawar, 50km (30 miles) from Charsadda, in 2014.

Survivor recalls 'horrible and wild attack'

How the attack unfolded

Why can't Pakistan stop the militants?

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in a statement: ""We are determined and resolved in our commitment to wipe out the menace of terrorism from our homeland.""

'Teacher shot back'

The attackers struck at about 09:30 local time (04:30 GMT), apparently climbing over a back wall under cover of the thick winter fog.

Intense gunfire and explosions were heard as security guards fought the attackers.

Students and staff ran to find cover in toilets and examination halls.

One student told television reporters he was in class when he heard gunshots: ""We saw three terrorists shouting, 'God is great!' and rushing towards the stairs of our department.

""One student jumped out of the classroom through the window. We never saw him get up.""

Reports say a chemistry lecturer, named by media as Syed Hamid Husain, shot back at the gunmen to allow his students to flee, before he was killed.

Geology student Zahoor Ahmed said the teacher had warned him not to leave the building after the first shots were fired.

""He was holding a pistol in his hand,"" he was quoted by AFP news agency as saying.

""Then I saw a bullet hit him. I saw two militants were firing. I ran inside and then managed to flee by jumping over the back wall.""

The victims - mostly male students - were shot in the head or chest. Seventeen people were injured. At least one security guard also died.

It could have been much worse - M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad

There have been conflicting claims about who could be involved in the attack, a sign of the kaleidoscopic mix of militant networks evolving along the Pakistan-Afghan border region in the north.

The attack comes amid a sudden spike in militant violence in Pakistan, after a year of relative peace and quiet largely attributed to a 2014 military operation against militant sanctuaries in Waziristan. Questions are now being raised over whether that operation really destroyed the ability of militants to regroup and strike at will.

The attack is reminiscent of the December 2014 attack on a school in Peshawar in which more than 150 people, mostly schoolboys, were killed. But damage to life and property this time has been much less, mainly due to swift action by the local police, but also because of the fact that the university had its own team of more than 50 trained security guards on duty who first confronted the attackers.

A dense fog that reduced visibility to less than 10m may also have been a factor, as one police officer explained, because it put the attackers at a disadvantage against the university guards who knew the premises better.

A senior Taliban commander, Umar Mansoor, told the media the attack was in response to a military offensive against militant strongholds. He said four suicide attackers had carried out the attack.

However, the group's main spokesman, Mohammad Khurasani, later told the BBC the Taliban had not been involved. He condemned the attack as ""un-Islamic"".

About 3,000 students are enrolled at Bacha Khan, but hundreds of visitors were also expected on Wednesday for a poetry event.

There is a symbolic value attached to Bacha Khan University as it is named after a Pashtun nationalist leader who believed in non-violent struggle, says BBC Urdu's Asad Ali Chaudry.

The title of Wednesday's poetry programme in his honour was ""peace"", he adds.

Just days ago, some schools in Peshawar were closed by the authorities amid reports that militants were planning an attack.

365056836476481537,false,Estimated 300 tons of contaminated water leaking into Pacific Ocean per day from wrecked #Fukushima nuclear plant http://t.co/fG8BSCizKB,http://on.rt.com/ubpmdj,True,"Fukushima leaking radioactive water for ‘2 years, 300 tons flowing into Pacific daily’","The rate at which contaminated water has been pouring into the Pacific Ocean from the disabled Fukushima nuclear plant is worse than thought before, an Industry Ministry official said as PM Shinzo Abe pledged to step up efforts to halt the crisis.

""We think that the volume of water is about 300 tons a day,"" said Yushi Yoneyama, an official with the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO).



Abe put the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry in charge of the situation, while demanding that the plant's operator, TEPCO take the necessary steps to deal with the cleanup, which is anticipated to take more than 40 years at a cost of US$11 billion.

On Wednesday TEPCO confirmed the leak but refused to confirm the quantity being emitted from the plant.



""We are not currently able to say clearly how much groundwater is actually flowing into the ocean,"" Tokyo Electric Power spokesman Noriyuki Imaizumi told Reuters when asked for an estimate.

Japanese authorities are working in crisis mode, attempting to assure the public both at home and abroad that the situation will not further deteriorate into a widespread environmental catastrophe.

Yoneyama said the government plans to reduce the leakage amount to 60 tons per day by as early as December, but given the Japanese government’s progress in the cleanup to date that goal may be difficult to achieve. Removing 300 tonnes of groundwater, however, would not necessarily halt leakage into the sea, he said.



The nuclear plant was severely damaged in an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011. About 90,000 people within a 20km radius of the plant were forced to evacuate their homes due to the possibility of a full-scale nuclear meltdown.

Nearing boiling point?

Earlier, TEPCO said it detected 2.35 billion becquerels of cesium per liter in water that is now leaking into the groundwater through cracks in the plant’s drainage system. This radiation level is roughly the same as that measured in April 2011.

The normal level is 150 becquerels of cesium per liter of water.

For the past two years, TEPCO has claimed that it managed to siphon off the excess water into specially-constructed storage tanks. However, the company was forced to admit late last month that radioactive water was still escaping into the Pacific Ocean. These consistent failures are testing the patience of Japanese authorities.

“You can't just leave it [disposing of radioactive waste at the plant] up to TEPCO,"" Shinji Kinjo, head of a Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) told Reuters. ""Right now, we have an emergency.""

Earlier this month, TEPCO was forced to go on the defensive after a scathing first-page article appeared in The Asahi Shimbun daily criticizing the company’s cleanup efforts.

“TEPCO did nothing for more than two years despite having pledged to seal a leaking hole between a turbine building [the leakage source] and an underground pit [a trench] in April 2011 when water contaminated with radioactive materials…was found to have leaked into the ocean; and the company only began preparing for shielding tests this summer after contaminated water was found to be leaking into the sea this time,” the newspaper stated on August 1, 2013.

TEPCO fired back with its own version of events, saying that despite “technical difficulties and a severe work environment” the company has been working to implement a plan “in order to further reduce the risk of having outflow of contaminated water beyond the trench.”

Although TEPCO engineers have constructed a barrier between the destroyed facility and the ocean, it only extends 1.8 meters below the ground, thus water continues to accumulate inside the plant vaults.

""If you build a wall, of course the water is going to accumulate there. And there is no other way for the water to go but up or sideways and eventually lead to the ocean,"" Masashi Goto, a nuclear engineer who has worked at several TEPCO plants, told Reuters. ""So now, the question is how long do we have?""

TEPCO has pledged to begin pumping enough radioactive seepage to stop the water level from rising. But the company faces limitations, as its storage tanks are 85 percent full.

“New measures are needed to stop the water from flowing into the sea,"" emphasized Kinjo, who accused TEPCO of failing to implement long-term solutions for a crisis that has been continuing for more than two years.

Not only is TEPCO running up against technical problems associated with the cleanup efforts, it must also deal with the unpredictable force of nature, specifically in the form of earthquakes.

On Sunday, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Miyagi prefecture, the same northeastern region of the island country that was devastated by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in 15,000 people killed and more than 3,200 missing.

""We think that the volume of water is about 300 tons a day,"" said Yushi Yoneyama, an official with the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO).



Abe put the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry in charge of the situation, while demanding that the plant's operator, TEPCO take the necessary steps to deal with the cleanup, which is anticipated to take more than 40 years at a cost of US$11 billion.

On Wednesday TEPCO confirmed the leak but refused to confirm the quantity being emitted from the plant.



""We are not currently able to say clearly how much groundwater is actually flowing into the ocean,"" Tokyo Electric Power spokesman Noriyuki Imaizumi told Reuters when asked for an estimate.

Japanese authorities are working in crisis mode, attempting to assure the public both at home and abroad that the situation will not further deteriorate into a widespread environmental catastrophe.

Yoneyama said the government plans to reduce the leakage amount to 60 tons per day by as early as December, but given the Japanese government’s progress in the cleanup to date that goal may be difficult to achieve. Removing 300 tonnes of groundwater, however, would not necessarily halt leakage into the sea, he said.



The nuclear plant was severely damaged in an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011. About 90,000 people within a 20km radius of the plant were forced to evacuate their homes due to the possibility of a full-scale nuclear meltdown.

Nearing boiling point?

Earlier, TEPCO said it detected 2.35 billion becquerels of cesium per liter in water that is now leaking into the groundwater through cracks in the plant’s drainage system. This radiation level is roughly the same as that measured in April 2011.

The normal level is 150 becquerels of cesium per liter of water.

For the past two years, TEPCO has claimed that it managed to siphon off the excess water into specially-constructed storage tanks. However, the company was forced to admit late last month that radioactive water was still escaping into the Pacific Ocean. These consistent failures are testing the patience of Japanese authorities.

International sanctions on Iran have been lifted after a watchdog confirmed it had complied with a deal designed to prevent it developing nuclear weapons.

The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the deal would contribute to improved regional and international peace and security.

The landmark deal between Iran and world powers was agreed last July.

Lifting the sanctions will unfreeze billions of dollars of assets and allow Iran's oil to be sold internationally.

The international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, said its inspectors had verified that Tehran had taken the required steps.

As part of the deal, Iran had to drastically reduce its number of centrifuges and dismantle a heavy-water reactor near the town of Arak, both of which could be used in creating nuclear weapons.

Iran has always maintained its nuclear programme is peaceful, but opponents of the deal - such as some US Republicans - say it does not do enough to ensure the country cannot develop a nuclear bomb.

The US Secretary of State John Kerry has ordered that US nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran be lifted.

Speaking in Vienna where he had been holding talks with his Iranian counterpart, Mr Kerry said Iran had ""undertaken significant steps"" which many people ""doubted would ever come to pass"".

Earlier on Saturday it emerged that Iran had released Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-American prisoners in an apparent prisoner swap with the United States.

Rezaian, 39, was jailed on charges, including espionage, last November.

The US said it was offering clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violation.

Mr Kerry said said he was ""very happy to say that as we speak five Americans have been released from custody and they should be on their way home to their families shortly"".

A fifth American, Matthew Trevithick, was also released on Saturday.

President Barack Obama would give more details of the releases later, Mr Kerry said.

The IAEA said it had installed a device at the Natanz plant to monitor Iran's uranium enrichment activities in real time, in order to verify that uranium enrichment levels were kept at up to 3.67% as agreed in the deal with world powers.

The organisation's head, Yukiya Amano, is to visit Tehran on Sunday for meetings with President Rouhani and other officials.

What is the nuclear deal?

In July 2015, Iran agreed a landmark nuclear deal with six world powers to limit its sensitive nuclear activities for more than a decade in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. The US is confident the agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy - and stresses that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.

What does Iran stand to gain?

The sanctions have cost Iran more than more than $160bn (£102bn) in oil revenue since 2012 alone. Once they are lifted, the country will be able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. Iran has the fourth largest oil reserves in the world and the energy industry is braced for lower prices. Iran will also be able to access more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas.

Anton Gerashchenko said the aircraft, which other sources said was a Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, came down near the city of Donetsk, a stronghold of pro-Russian rebels, adding that it was hit by a ground-to-air missile.

European flight safety body Eurocontrol said Thursday that Ukrainian authorities have closed the airspace over the east of the country following the crash.

“We do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the Ukraine Armed Forces did not fire at any targets in the sky,” Poroshenko said.

Russia's U.N. envoy denied involvement in the crash.



“We didn't do it,” Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.

Malaysia Airlines earlier said it had ""lost contact"" with MH-17 whose last known position was over Ukraine.



""Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam,"" the airline, still reeling from the disappearance of flight MH370, said on its Twitter account.

The plane was due to travel from Amsterdam on an overnight flight to Kuala Lumpur. (Daily Mail)



""The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace,"" it said, adding that it would provide more details soon.



Interfax-Ukraine quoted another Ukrainian official as saying the plane disappeared from radar when it was flying at 10,000 meters (33,000 feet), a typical cruising altitude for airliners.



It came down at Torez, near Shakhtersk, some 40 km (25 miles) from the Russia border. The area has been the scene of fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels.

Dozens of bodies were scattered around the smouldering wreckage of a passenger jet that crashed in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, a Reuters reporter said, while both Reuters and Agence France-Presse reported seeing no survivors. At least four French nationals were on board.

As plumes of black smoke rose up near a rebel-held village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine, an Associated Press journalist counted at least 22 bodies at the crash site 40 kilometers from the Russian border.

The plane appeared to have broken up before impact and the burning wreckage - including body parts and the belongings of passengers - was scattered over a wide area.

Wreckage and bodies found

An emergency services rescue worker said at least 100 bodies had so far been found at the scene, near the village of Grabovo, and that debris from the wreckage was scattered across an area up to about 15 km (nine miles) in diameter.

Broken pieces of the wings were marked with blue and red paint - the same colours as the emblem of the Malaysian airline which earlier this year lost track of a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was carrying almost 300 people.

Ukraine has accused Russia of taking an active role in the four-month-old conflict in recent days.

On Wednesday evening, a Ukrainian fighter jet was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane, Ukrainian authorities said, according to Associated Press.

Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko said the pilot of the Sukhoi-25 jet hit by the air-to-air missile was forced to bail after his jet was shot down.



Pro-Russia rebels, meanwhile, claimed responsibility for strikes Wednesday on two Ukrainian Sukhoi-25 jets. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the second jet was hit by a portable surface-to-air missile, but added the pilot was unscathed and managed to land his plane safely



Moscow denies Western charges that is supporting the separatists or sowing unrest in its neighbor.



Earlier this week, Ukraine said a military transport plane was shot down Monday by a missile fired from Russian territory.



The rebels are known to possess portable anti-aircraft rocket launchers, but Ukrainian officials say that kind of weapon would have been unable to reach Monday's plane at the altitude at which it was flying Monday.

Aviation experts, however, have questioned whether the stricken transport plane was flying at the altitude Ukrainian officials had claimed.

“We have confirmed that Ahmed Godane, the co-founder of al Shabaab, has been killed,” Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said in a statement.

Since taking charge of al Shabaab in 2008, Godane had restyled the group as a global player in the al Qaeda network, carrying out bombings and suicide attacks in Somalia and elsewhere in the region, including the Sept. 21, 2013, attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, that killed 67 people.

Godane publicly claimed responsibility for the Westgate attack, saying it was revenge for Kenyan and Western involvement in Somalia and noting its proximity to the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

His death leaves a gap in al Shabaab’s leadership and was seen as posing the biggest challenge to the group’s unity since it emerged as a fighting force eight years ago.

Abdi Ayante, director of the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, said Godane’s death would be “a game changer in many ways for al Shabaab.”

“What is likely to happen is a struggle for power,” he said a day before the Pentagon confirmed Godane’s death. Ayante said fragmentation was also possible in the absence of a leader with Godane’s experience and ruthless approach to dissent.

“He was a strong leader of al Shabaab .. and had basically taken care of rivals pretty effectively,” said Matthew Olsen, director of the U.S. government’s National Counterterrorism Center.

Al Shabaab is a “very fractious” group, and “there are a number of potential candidates” to succeed Godane, Olsen told reporters.

U.S. forces struck Godane’s encampment in south-central Somalia with Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions on Monday, but the Pentagon did not confirm his death until Friday, saying it was still assessing the results of the airstrike.

U.S. President Barack Obama, attending a NATO summit in Wales, mentioned the confirmation to reporters, saying: “We released today the fact that we have killed the leader of al Shabaab in Somalia.”

He also noted the United States has worked persistently to degrade the group’s operations.

AMNESTY

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud confirmed Godane’s killing, saying U.S. forces conducted the airstrike with the full knowledge and agreement of Somalia’s government.

In a statement, Mohamud said that while an extreme hard core may fight over the leadership of al Shabaab, his government was willing to offer a 45-day amnesty to al Shabaab members who renounce their links to the Islamist group and to al Qaeda.

“Those who choose to remain know their fate. Al Shabaab is collapsing,” the Somali president said, adding: “I say to the members of al Shabaab: Godane is dead and now is the chance for members of al Shabaab to embrace peace.”

Somalia’s government, with support from African peacekeepers and Western intelligence, has battled to curb al Shabaab’s influence and drive the group from areas it has continued to control since it was expelled from Mogadishu in 2011.

In the Pentagon’s statement, Kirby said that “removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al Shabaab.”

A separate statement from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the operation that killed Godane was the result of “years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals.”

The Obama administration would continue to use financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military tools to address the threat posed by al Shabaab, Earnest said.

But Theo Dolan of the Washington-based, government-funded U.S. Institute of Peace said Godane’s killing could bring more violence.

“For Kenya, this means the very real threat of reprisal attacks by local al Shabaab offshoot groups and the potential for more coordinated violence in the longer term,” Dolan said. Unlike the Westgate mall attacks, which targeted foreigners and wealthy Kenyans, recent violence has hit everyday Kenyans, Dolan said. The U.S. State Department declared al Shabaab a foreign terrorist organization in 2008.

The Pentagon did not say from where it launched the attack on Godane, but United States and France have stationed some military operations at a base in Djibouti, to the northwest of Somalia.

Foreign military personnel from the base were targeted by two al Shabaab suicide bombers earlier this year. The attack killed a Turkish national and wounded several Western military personnel. No U.S. troops were hurt.",4939
692127290998784001,non-rumor,Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns https://t.co/dJoXksfNlg https://t.co/g0YSJMi5Mo,http://onion.com/1PQUma8,True,Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns,"BAY LAKE, FL—Touting the new property’s wide variety of unique and imaginative attractions, representatives from the Walt Disney World Resort announced Monday the opening of Ordeal Kingdom, a new theme park specifically designed for full-scale family meltdowns.

Situated between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom, the 350-acre property reportedly incorporates many of the most aggravating elements of Disney’s other parks and expands them into a creative and fully immersive world of irritation, which is said to include the longest lines in the entire resort, a convoluted layout that is only depicted in indecipherable cartoon maps that are not to scale, and 150 percent higher prices. According to park director Jacob Bartlett, Ordeal Kingdom’s specialized combination of features will ensure a slowly building resentment among visiting families, eventually resulting in a dramatic public outburst followed by a silent walk back to the car.

“We’ve considered every detail to ensure parents and their kids have the heated argument of a lifetime,” said Bartlett, explaining that the park was split into five themed “lands,” including Fatigue Island and Hunger Lagoon, each of which can be reached by Mickey’s Congestion Junction Railway. “Whether it’s the sheer distance between rides or the unspecified bathroom locations, every aspect of the experience is guaranteed to ratchet up the tension until you and your family are screaming at each other and saying you should never have come in the first place.”

“No trip to Disney is complete without everyone in your party losing all emotional self-control,” Bartlett continued. “And at Ordeal Kingdom, we promise that all your wildest family blowups will come to life!”

According to Bartlett, considerable effort was devoted to crafting the park’s overall aesthetic, which emphasizes open, unshaded stretches of asphalt without any benches for resting. Additionally, no lockers have been provided anywhere on the grounds, encouraging guests to carry their bags and souvenirs around with them all day, often over stretches of quaint, uneven cobblestone.

Bartlett went on to add that the Disney FastPass service will be available in the new park, giving irritable visitors the opportunity to squabble over whether they wasted their no-wait ride selection too early in the day.



One of Ordeal Kingdom’s most popular attractions is expected to be Tarzan Adventure, a kid-friendly obstacle course that provides dozens of opportunities for parents to lose track of their children among twists and turns as they struggle to make their voices heard over loud jungle sound effects. Park officials explained that the design is intended to sow seeds of resentment toward whichever parent insisted that the attraction’s deliberately vague age requirements could be ignored, contributing to the eventual fiery altercation that officials expect to boil over at an understocked gift shop or a snack stand selling $11 soft pretzels.

“We provide the rides, games, and entertainment, and you do the rest—whether you opt to loudly belittle your spouse on the teacups ride or wait until you’re in your hotel room later that night to call your 8-year-old son an ungrateful little shit, Ordeal Kingdom is perfect for families of all kinds,” said Bartlett, raising his voice over the park’s theme song, which blares on a continuous loop from loudspeakers throughout the entire property. “Who knows? Maybe your family will have that special Disney shouting match as soon as you enter the park, right after you shell out 75 bucks for your daughter’s ticket only to have her scream right in your face that she hates you.”

Officials noted that Ordeal Kingdom also features live shows on five different stages, each one tailored to appeal exclusively to one gender and age group, with all shows occurring simultaneously once per day during lunchtime. In addition, the property hosts a number of three-hour-long parades throughout the day that can be viewed from designated obstructed viewpoints.

Furthermore, sources confirmed that numerous Disney characters, all from the 1985 movie The Black Cauldron, would be wandering the park for visitors to meet and take photos with.

“We want your family to have a one-of-a-kind experience while you’re here, which is why Disney employees will be on hand throughout the park to wish you ‘a magical day,’” said Bartlett, referring to the greeting that will begin to sound more and more like a taunt as the afternoon wears on. “Plus, as one final treat, you’ll find the parking lots completely unmarked, providing one last special opportunity for family members to cry, yell, and pitch a hysterical fit—regardless of how young or old they are—when it takes more than an hour to find the car!”

Read about his legacy and contribution to hip hop: http://t.co/gW7F6dRX3Y,http://rol.st/1B3HgEU,True,Sugarhill Gang Rapper Big Bank Hank Dead at 58,"Big Bank Hank, one third of pioneering rap group the Sugarhill Gang, has passed away from cancer at the age of 58. David Mallie, manager of the group's other members Wonder Mike and Master Gee, confirmed the rapper's death to Rolling Stone, saying the two surviving members were informed of his death on Tuesday morning.

Hank, born Henry Jackson, was best known as the splashiest and most colorful voice on 1979's ""Rapper's Delight,"" the runaway 12-inch that served as rap's musical ambassador and the record that almost single-handedly brought hip hop culture from the crumbling streets of the South Bronx to the rest of America and beyond.

""So sad to hear about our brothers passing,"" his bandmates Wonder Mike and Master Gee said in a statement to Rolling Stone. ""The three of us created musical history together with the release of 'Rapper's Delight.' We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace, Big Bank.""

Thirty-five years later, there still remains some debate as to whether the timeless, 14-minute rhyme spree was technically the first recorded hip-hop song; and controversy still shadows it, as the Sugarhill Gang were mostly New Jersey interlopers borrowing directly from Bronx-born Grandmaster Caz's rhyme book. But there is no question that the vivid, hilarious tales of dinnertime manners and cuckolded superheroes of ""Rapper's Delight"" was suburbia America's first experience with the nascent culture. It reportedly sold millions upon millions of copies, though Sugar Hill Records, notoriously close to their own accounting, never had it officially certified.

Jackson had lived in the Bronx during hip-hop's inception, attending high school with pioneers like Kool Herc and Coke La Rock and briefly having a managerial role with Caz himself. By 1979, rap music had spent a half-decade as live-performance party music, powered by street lights and youthful energy. However, it had never made it to vinyl until record producer Sylvia Robinson and her son Joey recruited Hank from an Englewood, New Jersey pizza parlor, where he was saving up money after getting a degree in oceanography from Bronx Community College.

Covered in pizza dough, he auditioned in the back of Joey's Oldsmobile 98, causing enough commotion to bring both Master Gee and Wonder Mike over. A late night cipher in Sylvia Robinson's home on a Friday night formed a group that started recording that Monday. The session, little more than a take or two of the three men rapping over the studio band playing Chic's ""Good Times,"" made music history almost instantly.

""I mean one minute you're walking down the street,"" Hank said in the book Yes Yes Y'all, ""The next minute you've got bodyguards and being chased down the street.""

Though the ""hotel, motel"" rhyme was originally floating in the hip-hop atmosphere from Coke La Rock, Hank's impassioned performance of it on ""Rapper's Delight"" marked its first appearance on wax. It's ultimately been transmuted, via American folk tradition, into a Number Three hit for Chingy (""Holidae In""), a Number Eight hit for Pitbull (""Hotel Room Service"") and bars for everyone from Wu-Tang Clan and 50 Cent to De La Soul and TLC.

The Sugarhill Gang had their share of success throughout the early Eighties with 1980's giddy ""8th Wonder"" and 1981's crowd-starting ""Apache,"" still a staple of sporting events the world over. But once Run-D.M.C.'s drum-machine-pummel and shouted delivery exploded in 1983, their disco-inflected sound instantly became dated. The 2011 documentary I Want My Name Back alleges that the Robinsons wouldn't let the crew evolve with the times.

Since they originally disbanded in 1985, Jackson had been estranged from the other two members of the group. He continued using the Sugarhill Gang name alongside Joey Robinson performing as ""Master Gee."" This iteration performed at the 2004 BET Awards, the inaugural VH-1 Hip-Hop Honors and Justin Timberlake's Old School Jam in 2011. Though Wonder Mike himself performed with this version for 11 years, the Robinson-led Sugarhill Gang ultimately invoked years of legal wrangling.

But no matter who was on stage, the music of the Sugarhill Gang remained musical bedrock. ""Rapper's Delight"" made a memorable appearance in the 1998 film The Wedding Singer and was turned into a high-energy single by Spanish quirk-pop trio Las Ketchup that went Number One in more than 20 countries. Hank's cry of ""Woo-Hah! Got them all in check"" also became a hit chorus for Busta Rhymes in 1996.

""I see groups that are hot one minute and next time you see them they’re asking if you want a soda with that Happy Meal,"" Hank told Maryland's Herald-Mail in 2013. ""We’ve had the ability to transcend generations and that’s a gift. That’s a blessing and I’m grateful for that.""",4897

The Turkish coastguard said that in Saturday's incident the migrants had been trying to reach the Greek island of Lesbos when their boat capsized.

Lesbos is one of the most popular European arrival points for asylum seekers.

The deputy governor of Turkey's Canakkale province, Saim Eskioglu, said the 17m (56ft) boat ""hit rocks soon after it left the coast"".

""We believe there are more dead bodies inside the boat,'' he told CNN-Turk TV.

Many of those rescued are being treated in hospital for hypothermia.

A Turkish man suspected of being the people smuggler who organised the trip has been arrested, according to Turkey's Dogan news agency.

However, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Turkey says those caught are typically middle-men rather than the main criminals behind the people smuggling.

Those on board were from Afghanistan, Syria and Myanmar, Turkey's Anadolu news agency said.

Last year more than one million migrants, many fleeing war, poverty and oppression, arrived in Europe, causing a political crisis among EU states.

The mass movement of refugees is largely fuelled by the war in Syria and talks have opened in Geneva to try to find a solution to the violence.

Last week, a draft European Commission report said Greece had ""seriously neglected"" its obligations to control the external frontier of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone.

The Greek government accused the commission of playing ""blame games"".

Late last year, the Turkish government signed a deal with the EU to receive about €3bn (£2.2bn; $3.3bn) in return for stemming the flow of asylum seekers. But the proposals have reportedly stalled amid objections from Italy.

Turkey is home to nearly three million refugees, most of them from Syria.

Many of them pay smugglers thousands of dollars to make the crossing to Greece. They then head north, with most trying to reach Germany, Austria and Scandinavia.

Where Europe is failing on migrants

The 28 member states have not agreed on an EU-wide mechanism for relocating migrants, meant to ease the burden on Greece and Italy. Only small groups have been relocated so far - and several states in Central and Eastern Europe refuse to accept migrants

The Schengen agreement on freedom of movement is in jeopardy - Hungary fenced off its borders with Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia; some other Schengen countries have re-imposed border controls: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, France and Belgium

The Dublin regulation is not working effectively. Countries are no longer sending back migrants to their first point of entry to the EU

Thousands of migrants - many of them Syrian war refugees - still arrive daily from Turkey

Processing of asylum applications is slow and there is a big backlog - so reception centres are overcrowded

Germany - the main destination for migrants - is rethinking its open-door policy, partly because of outrage over assaults on women in Cologne at New Year

A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",4889
550038665653542913,false,The President of Argentina Adopted a Jewish Teenager to Stop Him from Becoming a Werewolf http://t.co/YVDh1ioMjB http://t.co/mGjCqUTlng,http://bit.ly/1zudnXN,True,Adopting Potential Werewolves Is Routine Business for Argentine Presidents,"Photo via Flickr user Cristina Kirchner

Last week, President Cristina Kirchner adopted a Jewish teenager named Yair Tawil and posted pictures of the event on her Twitter feed. Outlets around the world ran with the story, explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore, only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite, but in Argentina, the story's a little different: the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore, seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus, the need for presidential action is pretty clear.

""The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions,"" Oscar Chamosa, a folklorist at the University of Georgia, told me. ""The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco—or the were-jaguar—which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf."" Chamosa says he's not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys.

But even if someone who's devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can't explain it, the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century, and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children, that the myth became a public policy problem. After all, terrified parents were (according to legend, at least) regularly committing infanticide.

""In order to counteract the myth, Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family,"" Chamosa explains, adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. ""The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh-male birth position would bring with it.""

This idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies, so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it's surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago, it's downright bizarre that they're still entertaining the notion of it today.

As per a decree that came out in 1973, adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children, because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non-Catholics. As the Independent noted, Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock, it's also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America.

The boy's parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993, but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchner's account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils, quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent.

Jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event, and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted—even symbolically—by a non-Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. (In Jewish folklore, people don't turn into werewolves, and whatever they were before beasthood is never really discussed.)

But most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like, for instance, that's it's kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies.

Stories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves, which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own country's recent memory believed they were chosen by God, Chamosa describes Argentina's Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who's a ""progressive left-wing president—more like a Marxist and a secular person in general."" Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year, this is an Argentine ritual that's basically a national inside joke.

Chamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason, anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same-sex children is rewarded with the prize.

Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon.

""Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory, especially—but not only—in rural areas,"" Chamosa says. ""I would say that only old people still believe [in el lobison]. But you really don't know.""

ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Las Vegas Sands chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson wants to build a $1 billion domed stadium on the UNLV campus and is meeting with the owner of the Oakland Raiders, company officials confirmed Thursday.

The Sands Corp. announced that it was lending its support behind a public-private partnership to build a 65,000-seat, domed stadium on a vacant 42 acres of land recently purchased by UNLV near the corner of Tropicana Avenue and Koval Lane across from McCarran International Airport.

Adelson has scheduled a Friday meeting in Las Vegas with Raiders owner Mark Davis. Sands spokesman Ron Reese didn't elaborate on the nature of their discussions, and the Raiders declined to directly address the meeting.

""In typical Raider fashion,"" Davis said with a laugh over the phone from the Bay Area, ""I can neither confirm nor deny.""

UNLV president Len Jessup wrote in a confidential memo leaked earlier Thursday that representatives of the Raiders will be in Las Vegas on Friday to check out potential stadium sites.

""Correspondingly, the Sands leadership team let us know that officials from the Oakland Raiders are scheduled to travel to Las Vegas and tour locations around the valley for a potential new home, and they have asked us to meet them at our 42-acre site on Friday morning to answer questions about that site,"" Jessup wrote in the memo, which was reported earlier by Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston.

UNLV is looking for a new home for its football program, which has played at 35,500-seat Sam Boyd Stadium some nine miles from campus on the eastern edge of the city since 1971.

According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles-based Majestic Realty Co. and UNLV are involved in the conceptual plans, and Las Vegas Sands senior vice president of government relations and community development Andy Abboud said the project would be a ""public-private"" partnership, with the Sands or the Adelson family contributing a large portion of the financing.

""He said the casino company, which operates the Venetian and Palazzo [casinos], as well as casinos in Macau, Singapore and Pennsylvania, could also raise financing for the project,"" the Review-Journal reported.

Tony Sanchez, UNLV's football coach, said ""having an on-campus, state-of-the-art stadium would be huge.""

""We have a nice stadium now; the location is just a little further out,"" said Sanchez, who grew up a die-hard Raiders fan in the Bay Area. ""To have something on campus, right in the heart of Las Vegas, would change the entire game-day atmosphere. We're right near the Strip. People can walk or take public transportation. It would be a great addition for the city.""

Davis has long stated that remaining in Oakland is his primary goal, but after being rebuffed in an attempt to move to Los Angeles and join the Chargers in a joint-stadium project in nearby Carson, the Raiders do not have a lease for a home stadium for the 2016 season. They do have the option to join the Rams in Inglewood should the Chargers decline.

It is expected that the Raiders will play at least the 2016 season in Oakland. They also have been linked to San Diego, should the Chargers go to Los Angeles, for the following years as well as to San Antonio.

The NFL has had a hard line against Las Vegas, and it is hard to see the league signing off on allowing a team to relocate to the gambling capital of the country. The NFL did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Las Vegas has chased a major league franchise for almost two decades, including MLB and NBA teams. The city appears close to getting an NHL team in under-construction T-Mobile Arena between the New York-New York and Monte Carlo casinos. The ambitious 20,000-seat T-Mobile Arena, set to open in April, was privately funded by casino company MGM, a Las Vegas Sands competitor.

And while Las Vegas might be a relatively small media market at No. 41 nationally, it is bigger than four other current NFL markets in Jacksonville (No. 48), New Orleans (No. 51), Buffalo (No. 52) and Green Bay (No. 68), per last year's Nielsen data.

Support from Adelson, who has consistently ranked as one of the world's richest people, could mean a better fate for the latest proposal.

""Projects like this need a lot of very, very strong leadership, a lot of conviction, a lot of focus and great resources,'' said Craig Cavileer of Majestic Realty, the project's development partner. ""Certainly, Sheldon and his team have proved time and time again that they produce great projects.""

693711272014155776,non-rumor,Zika fever: A newly emerging disease is threatening the Americas https://t.co/edy0wThso8 https://t.co/NGBjQhYlOM,http://econ.st/1m1uj8e,True,Virus chequers,"ZIKA, a mosquito-borne virus that arrived in Brazil last May, is an avid traveller—and an increasingly feared guest. It has since found its way into 17 other countries in the Americas. Until October, Zika was not thought much of a threat: only a fifth of infected people fall ill, usually with just mild fever, rash, joint aches and red eyes. Since then, though, evidence has been piling up that it may cause birth defects in children and neurological problems in adults. On January 15th America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised pregnant women not to travel to countries where Zika is circulating.

The virus was first isolated in 1947, from a monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda. Since then it has caused small and sporadic outbreaks in parts of Africa and South-East Asia. In Brazil, for reasons yet unclear, it quickly flared into an epidemic after its arrival—by official estimates infecting as many as 1.5m people.

Alarm bells started ringing in October, when doctors in Pernambuco, one of Brazil’s north-eastern states, saw a huge increase in babies born with microcephaly: an abnormally small head, often with consequent brain damage. In the next four months more than 3,500 cases of microcephaly were reported in Brazil. That compared with fewer than 200 a year in the five years before 2015. None of the known causes of the condition—which include genetic abnormalities, drugs, alcohol, rubella infection and exposure to some chemicals during pregnancy—seemed a plausible culprit.

Last week, CDC scientists announced the best evidence so far that Zika can pass from mother to fetus: they found the virus in four Brazilian babies with microcephaly who had died in the womb or shortly after birth. Previously, Brazilian researchers had found Zika in the amniotic fluid of women carrying fetuses with microcephaly.

There is another fear. After Zika arrived in Brazil, and also in El Salvador, both saw a sharp increase in severe neurological and autoimmune problems, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can lead to paralysis. These also surged in French Polynesia after Zika broke out there in 2013.

Working out the extent to which Zika, alone or combined with other things, is to blame for any of this is tricky. Dengue and chikungunya—mosquito-borne viruses with similar symptoms—are common where Zika is making the rounds. According to Scott Weaver of the University of Texas, tests that spot Zika work only during its infectious phase, which lasts just a few days. After that, they are often useless if the patient has had dengue or been vaccinated against yellow fever. And only laboratories that can do sophisticated molecular tests are in the game in the first place. All of which means that most cases of Zika are missed, and many are misdiagnosed.

Bearing these caveats in mind, researchers are mining the available surveillance data for answers. More solid results will come from prospective studies, set up recently, which are tracking pregnant women in Brazil, looking at whether those who catch Zika are more likely to have babies with birth defects.

Researchers in America and other countries have begun work on a vaccine. Unlike the one for Ebola, though, which had been in the pipeline for a decade when the epidemic in West Africa began, a Zika vaccine is “at ground zero”, says Alan Barrett, also of the University of Texas. That is where potential antiviral drugs are, too.

The spread of Zika makes attacking disease-carrying mosquitoes all the more important. Mostly, Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti, which is also the vector of dengue and yellow fever. This insect lives in tropical climes, but Aedes albopictus, found as far north as New York and Chicago, and in parts of southern Europe, can also do the job, though it is not clear how efficiently. A paper published last week in the Lancet shows where Zika could become endemic (see map). But places where air-conditioning, screened windows and mosquito control are the norm are unlikely to see outbreaks flare up.

In December, Brazil decreed a national public-health emergency. This has removed bureaucratic hurdles to the purchase of insecticides for mosquito larvae, equipment for health workers and the like—and prompted speculation about whether this bureaucracy was necessary in the first place. It also enabled the deployment of the army to help 310,000 health workers in the mosquito-eradication drive. Brazil was declared free of A. aegypti in 1958, after a campaign that included regular fumigation and visits to ensure households got rid of standing water, where mosquitoes like to breed. Since then, the insect has bounced back. Might the fear of Zika help finish the job properly this time?",4831
701975210044497921,unverified,Study concluded that the Clinton camp has “no statistical basis” to back claims that it won Latino vote in NV. https://t.co/UTXQCQBX2y,http://fusion.net/story/271686/bernie-sanders-latino-voters-nevada/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialshare&utm_content=theme_top,True,Did Bernie Sanders really win the Latino vote in Nevada?,"The Sanders campaign is sticking to its guns and insisting that it won the Latino vote in Nevada—a claim contested by the Clinton camp following the former Secretary of State’s win in that state’s democratic primary last Saturday.

An analysis of publicly available voter data distributed to the press by the Sanders campaign concluded that the Clinton camp has “no statistical basis” to back claims that it won most of the Latino vote in Nevada. It maintains that support from young voters helped Sanders win “the Latino vote.”

Both campaigns are hungry to prove their proposals are resonating with Latino and other nonwhite voters. Though Sanders lost Nevada, it was the first battleground state where Latino voters played a significant role. Claiming victory with Latino voters there could boost either candidate’s chances of solidifying Latino support in other key states.

Soon after caucuses closed in Nevada on Saturday, the Bernie Sanders campaign sent a statement to journalists declaring Sanders had won the state’s Latino vote.

Ultimately Hillary Clinton carried the state by 5.3%, but the Sanders campaign stressed the vote returns show their campaign is gaining traction with Latinos and other non-white voters.

“What we learned today is that Hillary Clinton’s firewall with Latino voters is a myth,” Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for the Sanders campaign, wrote in the statement sent to the press.

“According to entrance polls Sanders won among Latino voters by 8 points,” read the email. But those numbers may not add up.

Clinton won about 60% of delegates in areas with a heavy Latino population, according to The New York Times, a figure that raises questions about the credibility of the entrance polls cited by the Sanders campaign.

UPDATE: In Nevada's Latino-majority precincts, Clinton won 207 delegates and Sanders won just 130. Proves entrance polls were wrong. — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) February 21, 2016

The Times cited a report, issued by a leading research group that focuses on Latinos, showing that “Mrs. Clinton was victorious in the majority of the 40 precincts in Nevada that have more than 50 percent Latino registrants.” Given that dominance, the entrance polls cited by Sanders “do not add up,” according to the report from Latino Decisions for the Clinton campaign.

The Sanders campaign is discrediting the methodology used by Latino Decisions.

“The methodology of using heavily Latino or ‘barrio’ precincts to represent Latino voting behavior has been considered ineffective and discarded for more than 30 years due to non-barrio residential patterns common among Latino voters since the 1980’s,” said Antonio González, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute (WCVI), a nonpartisan Hispanic research and public policy organization in San Antonio.

“Simply put there is no relevant statistical inconsistency between Edison’s Entry Poll results for Latinos, Whites, and Blacks and the overall election results. Based on this fact WCVI concludes that there is no statistical basis to question the Latino vote breakdown between Secretary Clinton and Sen. Sanders.”

The Sanders campaign says its findings are consistent with Latino voter patterns in other states.

“It is not surprising that we received the support of the Latino community in Nevada, especially since the majority of those that turned out were young Latinos,” said Erika Andiola, a Sanders spokeswoman. “We have consistently seen that the under-35 age group overwhelmingly supports Sen. Sanders, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. It’s also important to remember that young Latinos live all across Nevada and not just in Clark County.”

The median age of all Latinos in Nevada is 26 years old, compared with a median age of 44 for whites and 33 for blacks, according to Census data.

Here’s what we do know: Nevada doesn’t track voter registration or results by race, so both campaigns are making claims based on their best guesses. There isn’t much evidence that Clinton won Latino voters by a landslide either.

We also know that entrance polls are notoriously unreliable. In Iowa, for example, entrance polls projected a six-point margin of victory for Clinton when in fact she squeaked by on less than 1%. The entrance poll cited in the Sanders email had a margin of error of plus or minus seven points, according to The Washington Post.

The Clinton campaign has been active in Nevada much longer than the Sanders campaign, with Clinton unveiling a glimpse into her immigration policy at a Las Vegas high school in May 2015.

Zack Dobson and younger brother Zaevion were 2,700 miles away from Eugene, but had a huge Ducks flag hanging in their shared bedroom in Knoxville, Tennessee.

""I love their football crowd energy,"" 17-year-old Zack said. ""Also the uniforms. Zae liked Bama too, but Oregon was the school we talked about.""

That all changed on the night of Dec. 17.

You've probably heard the story by now. The one about the 15-year-old high school football player who was killed as he shielded three girls from gunfire when several men went on a shooting spree. Neither the football player nor the girls were targeted, police say. Just a horribly tragic case of wrong place, wrong time as they hung out outside an apartment in the Dobsons' North Knoxville neighborhood.

Zack and Zaevion Dobson, brothers and teammates for life. Courtesy of Zack Dobson

That selfless football player was mourned across the country as the story spread. It even reached the White House, where President Obama called him a ""hero at 15"" for the ultimate sacrifice he made in defense of others.

That football player? That hero? His name was Zaevion Dobson. And he had a family. He had a brother. A brother who -- now that the initial outpouring of support from across the world has subsided for the most part -- is having to cope without his little bro. Without his football teammate at Fulton High School. Without the person he shared a room and a dream with.

Insert Brandon Marshall.

The six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, currently of the New York Jets, was so moved by Zaevion's act of heroism that he's putting together a mini-documentary on it that will air on CBS on Super Bowl Sunday.

Marshall hasn't been shy about tackling issues that are close to his heart. Among those are his public revelation about a lifelong battle with depression and borderline personality disorder, along with a strong stance on the domestic violence issue that has reared its ugly head in the NFL in recent years and was a part of Marshall's rough upbringing in Pittsburgh and Florida.

""I grew up in a house, better yet an environment, a neighborhood where it was volatile,"" Marshall told the Chicago Tribune in 2014.

So Marshall knows a thing or two about overcoming tragedy. About rising above things that are out of his control.

In other words, the perfect person to talk to Zack Dobson.

And so he did.

Shoutout to @BMarshall for coming thru 💯 awesome guy ❗️❗️ pic.twitter.com/8xaQ0Rumzb — Zack Dobson (@stn__zack) January 28, 2016

On Thursday, Marshall came to the Dobson's neighborhood and chatted with Zae's big brother for two hours. They're both receivers -- Zack also plays defensive back and is a state-champion track athlete -- with incredible athletic ability. Zack even made SportsCenter back in the fall for this incredible backflip catch. But this wasn't really a football talk. This was a life talk.

""We talked a lot about him growing up in the same environment as I do and how he had overcome a lot of things to be successful in life,"" Zack said. ""He also told me to play for my brother every time I'm on the field.""

For someone who has had to start the second semester of his junior year at Fulton under the most trying of circumstances, it was just what he needed to hear.

Hearing it from a guy who has reached the level that Zack strives for made it extra special of course, but he said all of the letters and tweets and messages of support that have poured in from all corners of the country has also been moving.

""I'm honored to know that the world cares about what happened on 12/17/15,"" Zack said. ""It shocked me Obama talked about Zae like that. I would love to meet him and thank him one day.""

As for now, the Dobsons are ""hanging in there day by day,"" Zack said. ""We're just staying prayed up and thinking of all the good memories we did have with Zae.""

Zack, who received a football scholarship offer from Austin Peay State University just the other day, is also thinking about his future. It's what 17-year-olds with big dreams do.

Courtesy Zack Dobson

That big Oregon flag still hangs in the bedroom. It's on Zae's side of the room, right next to his still-made-up bed and a collection of footballs, a helmet and a poster commemorating Fulton's third straight state title in 2014.

The Ducks are still the goal. Zack is only 5-foot-8, but runs a 4.4 40. The triple-jump state champion said he ""really loves the track program"" at UO and, in an ideal world, would be a two-sport athlete in Eugene.

And there's no doubt where the inspiration will come from.

""All the hard work is for him,"" said Zack, who changed his Instagram handle to @longlivezae_ not long after his brother's death. ""Hopefully I can live out all the dreams me and Zae talked about.""",4797

Iraq's Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating.

A senior Iraqi official has said a key aide to al-Baghdadi, named Abdur Rahman al-Athaee, or Abu Sajar, was killed in the strike, the Guardian reported.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province. The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strike wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Both officials said the operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces. Neither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi's apparent injuries.

Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential material. State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.

Earlier on Sunday, a Tweeter account attributed to Islamic State spokesman Mohammed al-Adnani also implied that al-Baghdadi was wounded.

""Do you think the Caliphate would end with the Caliph's death? We announce leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is in well, and wish him a speedy recovery.""

وهل تظنون بأن الخلافة تنتهي باسشهاد الخليفة؟ نطمئن الأمة بأن أميرها أبو بكر البغدادي بخير ولله الحمد ادعوا له بالشفاء العاجل #دعاء

But others in the Tweetersphere questioned the report, casting doubt on the account's authenticity.

""ISIL sources tell me this a fake account run by Jordanian intelligence and the news on Baghdadi injury is a hoax....,"" Al Jazeera reporter Imran Khan tweeted.

Foreign Policy editor David Kenner also put in his two cents, citing researcher Romain Caillet as saying the account is fake, and the report on al-Baghdadi's injury was a hoax.

FYI, researchers like @RomainCaillet say acct claiming to be ISIS spox is fake. Said Baghdadi injured in airstrike. https://t.co/7Od2OrDCId

The reclusive leader is purported to have made only one public appearance, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. Al-Baghdadi's purported appearance in Mosul came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.

Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as a ruler and not just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group now administers courts, fixes roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology.

A U.S.-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive. The Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray.

On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce. The plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100. There now are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, out of the 1,600 previously authorized.",4796

This blood sucker might not be your best friend, but it loves you.

The mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is causing widespread fear in Brazil where it is spreading the Zika virus that has been linked to thousands of babies being born with birth defects.

So what do we know about it?

It loves our cities

This is not some jungle-dwelling insect that rarely comes into contact with people.

It is one of those animals, like cockroaches, pigeons and urban foxes, that thrives in built-up areas.

It does not need natural water sources to breed as it can lay eggs in the small and plentiful pools of stagnant water, such as gutters or flower pots, found in cities .

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mosquito larvae thrive in stagnant water

Cities like Singapore have big problems with the mosquito.

Prof Uriel Kitron, from Emory University, said: ""Aegypti is really adapted well for urban areas.

""It is becoming more and more of an urbanised world and aegypti thrives - Brazil is an extreme example going from 20% to 80% urban in 70 years.""

There's also plenty of food - us.

They harbour a bunch of diseases

Image copyright SPL Image caption Dengue fever is also spread by mosquitoes

Zika is currently getting all the attention, but Aedes aegypti has long been known as the yellow fever mosquito.

Yellow fever is a viral disease that can cause jaundice, bleeding and multiple organ failure in some cases.

And 390 million people are infected with the dengue virus each year, largely as a result of bites from Aedes aegypti.

Chikungunya, another virus causing alarm as it expands around the world, is also spread by the insects.

They do it by biting someone who is infected and then biting someone else.

More on the Zika crisis:

Up to four million Zika cases predicted

What you need to know

Zika 'could become pandemic'

Video - WHO: 'Level of concern is high'

Video - How mums-to-be are tackling Zika

Only the females bite and they love human blood

Both the male and female mosquitoes feed off plant nectar. However, the females need a blood meal in order to produce eggs.

Two traits make them especially good at spreading disease.

First they feed almost exclusively on humans, so if they pick up a disease from one person, they are likely to pass it on with their next bite.

Other mosquitoes are less efficient spreaders as they feed off a variety of animals.

These particular blood suckers also drink little and often.

Rather than gorge their entire meal from one person and running the risk of being swatted they graze from multiple people making it easier to spread disease.

They are also active during the day so bed nets are less effective.

It's a lazy hitch-hiker

Image copyright SPL

""They're amazing hitch-hikers, but they're lousy flyers,"" argues Prof Kitron.

The mosquitoes that carry malaria can fly for miles, but Aedes aegypti is pretty lazy by comparison.

It stays close to the area where it was born and 100m is a long way for it to fly.

Prof Kitron says: ""But they're good at catching rides, their whole life cycle can take place in the water in a boat.""

So despite its short flying distances it has managed to conquer the world.

It has a cousin that could bring Zika to Europe

Aedes aegypti lives in tropical and subtropical climates - it is why experts are worried Zika could spread across the Americas, a huge swathe of Africa as well as India and China.

However, the similar Aedes albopictus - or Asian Tiger mosquito - likes cooler more temperate areas.

It has been linked to outbreaks of chikungunya virus in Italy and France.

There are suspicions that it could also spread Zika virus, but it is not yet clear.

Out of Africa

Aedes aegypti exists in two forms or sub-species.

Aedes aegypti formosus is the original type found in Africa, which does not often come into contact with people and is not a major spreader of disease.

Aedes aegypti aegypti is the form that has spread around the world.

It probably arrived in the Americas from Africa after being transported around the ocean in the ships of European colonisers.

""Yellow fever outbreaks were known in Africa from around 1400 and the first confirmed cases, from the Yucatan, were documented in 1648,"" Dr Michael Bonsall from Oxford University said.

It is now found throughout tropical and subtropical regions around the globe.

Killed off once before

Image copyright SPL

Eradication campaigns were successful in the Americas with 18 countries getting rid of the insect by 1962.

But insecticide resistance plus a lack of political will led to the mosquito rebounding.

But now far more people live in its preferred urban home and a similar achievement would require a huge effort.

688441130271289350,non-rumor,From the BB vault: Donald Trump's dad arrested in KKK brawl with cops https://t.co/fpSE9nAMaE https://t.co/Ux3astp9KM,https://boingboing.net/2015/09/09/1927-news-report-donald-trump.html,True,1927 news report: Donald Trump's dad arrested in KKK brawl with cops,"1927 news report: Donald Trump's dad arrested in KKK brawl with cops

According to a New York Times article published in June 1927, a man with the name and address of Donald Trump's father was arraigned after Klan members attacked cops in Queens, N.Y.

In an article subtitled ""Klan assails policeman"", Fred Trump is named in among those taken in during a late May ""battle"" in which ""1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all."" At least two officers were hurt during the event, after which the Klan's activities were denounced by the city's Police Commissioner, Joseph A. Warren.

“The Klan not only wore gowns, but had hoods over their faces almost completely hiding their identity,” Warren was quoted as saying in the article, which goes on to identify seven men “arrested in the near-riot of the parade.”

Named alongside Trump are John E Kapp and John Marcy (charged with felonious assault in the attack on Patrolman William O'Neill and Sgt. William Lockyear), Fred Lyons, Thomas Caroll, Thomas Erwin, and Harry J Free. They were arraigned in Jamaica, N.Y. All seven were represented by the same lawyers, according to the article.

The final entry on the list reads: “Fred Trump of 175-24 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, was discharged.”

In 1927, Donald Trump's father would have been 21 years old, and not yet a well-known figure. Multiple sources report his residence at the time—and throughout his life—at the same address.

To be clear, this is not proof that Trump senior—who would later go on to become a millionaire real estate developer—was a member of the Ku Klux Klan or even in attendance at the event. Despite sharing lawyers with the other men, it's conceivable that he may have been an innocent bystander, falsely named, or otherwise the victim of mistaken identity during or following a chaotic event.

The name of Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Drumpf, was anglicized to Frederick Trump, but he died several years before the report.

A person answering calls at the N.Y.C. Police Department's Records Section said that arrest reports dating that far back were not available in any form. We've sent a formal request in writing and will update if and when we receive a response. We've also left a message with the Trump Campaign requesting a callback.

The article, published on June 1, 1927, describes police frustration at rowdy parades, the Klan's use of masks, and its growing presence in New York City. The Klan, originally founded in the 19th century, was reborn in 1915 as a violent supremacist organization associated with lynchings, white nationalism, and the distinctive white robes and hoods used by Klansmen to conceal their identity at parades and other events. At its mid-1920s peak, it had up to 6m members, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Fred Trump, who died in 1999, was a New York real estate developer and the father of mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump. Born in the Bronx to German immigrants, Fred became a real estate developer in his teens; at about the time of his apparent arrest, he was constructing single-family houses in Queens, according to his obituary in the Times. At his death, his net worth was estimated at between $250m and $300m. A savvy businessman and real estate developer, his wealth enabled the junior Trump to start big.

If the man arrested at the riotous Klan parade was indeed Donald's father, it would not be his last tangle with the law over issues concerning minorities. A 1979 article, published by Village Voice, reported on a civil rights suit that alleged that the Trumps refused to rent to black home-seekers, and quotes a rental agent who said Fred Trump instructed him not to rent to blacks and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. The case was settled in a 1975 consent degree described as ""one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated,"" but the Justice Department subsequently complained that continuing ""racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity.""

Donald Trump has made nativism a pillar of his campaign, describing Mexican immigrants as rapists and two Boston men who beat a homeless immigrant as ""passionate"" fans.

The events described in the Times' article took place 22 years before Donald Trump was even born, and he’s not responsible for any youthful sins his father may have committed. But given the racially-charged tone of the younger Trump's campaign, it raises questions about the values he was taught by the man whose fortune he inherited.

490136764619948032,false,The fact that Malaysia Airlines #MH17 was shot down may hinder insurance payouts http://t.co/ZaRpwrSoaa http://t.co/o0xnrXi5N9,http://on.mash.to/WhVlvQ,True,Shooting of Malaysia Airlines Plane May Hinder Insurance Payouts,"Soon after the news broke of the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the question emerged in boardrooms from New York to Kuala Lumpur: Who will pay for the loss of the plane and its nearly 300 passengers and crew, given that the commercial airliner was ""blown out of the sky""? Who will be left with the bill that could run into the billions of dollars?

To the rest of us, it might seem an insensitive debate — especially so quickly after the plane went down.

But for insurance brokers, airline executives and government officials, it's a pertinent — if tricky — question that hinges on the interpretation of ""wartime exclusions"" and hotly contested facts on the ground in the border region between Ukraine and Russia.

The key issue is whether the shoot-down of a civilian airliner over an area where there is a conflict but no official declaration of war will trigger aviation insurance policies' ""wartime exclusion"" clauses. Such clauses are written into almost every insurance policy of a costly, high-tech airliner such as the 777-200, and they mandate that the insurance companies underwriting the aircraft won't be liable if an act of war or terrorism destroys the plane.

Some experts say the clause would likely apply in this case, although others aren't so sure. No war has been declared between Ukraine and Russia, let alone between Ukraine and Malaysia or Russia and Malaysia.

So, what was it in the eyes of insurers and international law?

Bill Coffin, group editorial director for the insurance industry publication National Underwriter, says the wartime clause would probably apply to Flight 17, and this would mean the airline itself, and therefore the Malaysian government, would be liable both for the loss of the plane itself and for any liability claims from passengers' families. This could add up to $1 billion or more.

The Malaysian government could try to seek compensation from whomever shot the plane down. But, he said, if it was a rebel group with ties to Moscow, “good luck in trying to negotiate with them to try to give you some compensation,” Coffin said.

Bob Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, told Mashable that “It will take a while before the details emerge as to what specifically the types of coverage Malaysia Airlines had in place.” For example, Hartwig says the airline might have taken out additional insurance coverage in case the wartime exclusion would some day come into play.

Yet Rick Roberts, vice president of the Risk and Insurance Management Society (RIMS), said there is no insurance product out there that can protect an airline against an act of war to get around that exclusion. “I’m not aware that there’s any coverage for an act of war, anywhere around the world,” he said.

In this case, the lack of a war declaration means the exclusion wouldn't apply, and Malaysia Airlines would receive an insurance payout. For it to be terrorism, Roberts said, “Someone has to certify that the act that occurred wasn’t a mistake — that it was a malicious act.”

“There hasn’t been a war declared, and that knocks down the exclusion,” Roberts said. “Unless Russia has declared war on Malaysia, that would knock out the exclusion.”

“Based on the real early facts it falls out of both of those categories.”

Depending on how insurance policies were written, and whether there will be any lawsuits from victims, it's possible that the Malaysian government, which owns Malaysia Airlines, will seek damages from the Russian or Ukrainian governments, and take one or both of those countries to an international court.

After all, the liability questions could determine the viability of Malaysia Airlines itself, which is government-owned but hasn't been profitable since 2010.

According to aviation insurance experts, this is not a clear-cut case where it is almost assured that the multiple insurers protecting the $500 million Boeing 777 would compensate Malaysia Airlines for the loss of the plane, known as the ""hull loss,"" and for liability for passengers' deaths.

The liability costs tend to vary depending on victims' nationalities, since countries provide their citizens with differing ways to sue airlines for damages. In this case, the vast majority of victims came from the Netherlands.

Mashable confirmed that the insurance broker for this Boeing 777 was Willis Insurance of New York City, though the company would not disclose the lead underwriter.

With the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 earlier this year, the lead insurer was Allianz.",4672

|| By FITSNEWS || A discussion over a pending criminal domestic violence (CDV) bill took a bizarre turn this week when S.C. Senator Thomas Corbin – a “Republican” from Travelers Rest, S.C. – offered some bizarrely sexist commentary on the role of women in the political process.

Corbin’s comments – made at a legislative dinner held in downtown Columbia, S.C. – were reportedly directed at S.C. Senator Katrina Shealy, the only female member of the 46-person State Senate.

According to multiple witnesses who attended the dinner – held at Cowboy Brazilian Steakhouse on Main Street (a few blocks from the S.C. State House) -Senate judiciary committee members were discussing the CDV issue, which has been a source of several previous headaches for the GOP.

That’s when Corbin – no stranger to making bizarre statements – is said to have begun needling his lone female colleague regarding her gender.

“I see it only took me two years to get you wearing shoes,” Corbin told Shealy, who was elected in 2012 as a petition candidate.

Wait … what?

By way of explanation, lawmakers and legislative staffers have previously told FITS about statements made by Corbin – statements reflecting his belief that women do not belong in the S.C. General Assembly and should instead be “at home baking cookies” or “barefoot and pregnant.”

“He makes comments like that all the time to everybody – including Senator Shealy,” one Senate staffer told FITS.

Corbin’s latest comments took his sexism to a whole new level, though.

At one point in the conversation – which quickly escalated into a confrontation – Shealy is said to have angrily asked Corbin where he “got off” attacking women.

His response – overheard by numerous lobbyists and fellow lawmakers – was one for the ages.

“Well, you know God created man first,” Corbin said, reportedly smirking at Shealy. “Then he took the rib out of man to make woman. And you know, a rib is a lesser cut of meat.”

Ummmm … wow.

Calls to Corbin’s office were not immediately returned, but sources close to the 50-year-old lawmaker tell FITS his comments were part of a “running joke” between him and Shealy.

“He’s just needling her – he don’t mean nothing by it,” the source said.

Shealy declined to discuss the matter with FITS – citing its irrelevance to the legislative matter under discussion – but sources at the event tell FITS Corbin did not appear to be joking. Furthermore, they added that if there really was a “running joke,” Shealy clearly wasn’t in on it.

“She got in his face,” one lobbyist who attended the event said of Shealy’s reaction, adding that at one point “we thought we were going to have to hold her back.”

Wow … good for her.

Shealy has been an incredibly substantive, consistently pro-free market reformer ever since she defeated former S.C. Sen. Jakie Knotts – a fiscally liberal, “Republican” – in 2012. She’s taken principled stands for taxpayers – and even taken on her former ally governor Nikki Haley when she thought it was right.

We like her … not because she’s a woman, but because she’s a solid Senator who is strong on the issues that ought to matter to Palmetto State citizens.

As for Corbin? He’s got a decent voting record, but the first-term lawmaker continues to marginalize himself by saying ridiculous things in public.

Maybe he’s joking, maybe he isn’t … and he’s obviously got a right to speak his mind like the rest of us … but Corbin needs to recognize right quickly that the fight for expanded individual liberty and economic prosperity is (and always should be) blind to questions of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other determining characteristic that’s got nothing to do with a person’s views on the issues.

Otherwise he will continue to be nothing but a sideshow at the S.C. State House … one with a serious problem heading into the 2016 election cycle.

Shealy declined to discuss the matter with FITS – citing its irrelevance to the legislative matter under discussion – but sources at the event tell FITS Corbin did not appear to be joking. Furthermore, they added that if there really was a “running joke,” Shealy clearly wasn’t in on it.

“She got in his face,” one lobbyist who attended the event said of Shealy’s reaction, adding that at one point “we thought we were going to have to hold her back.”

Wow … good for her.

Shealy has been an incredibly substantive, consistently pro-free market reformer ever since she defeated former S.C. Sen. Jakie Knotts – a fiscally liberal, “Republican” – in 2012. She’s taken principled stands for taxpayers – and even taken on her former ally governor Nikki Haley when she thought it was right.

We like her … not because she’s a woman, but because she’s a solid Senator who is strong on the issues that ought to matter to Palmetto State citizens.

As for Corbin? He’s got a decent voting record, but the first-term lawmaker continues to marginalize himself by saying ridiculous things in public.

Maybe he’s joking, maybe he isn’t … and he’s obviously got a right to speak his mind like the rest of us … but Corbin needs to recognize right quickly that the fight for expanded individual liberty and economic prosperity is (and always should be) blind to questions of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other determining characteristic that’s got nothing to do with a person’s views on the issues.

Otherwise he will continue to be nothing but a sideshow at the S.C. State House … one with a serious problem heading into the 2016 election cycle.

Mashable cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the video.

The beginning of the audio, Ukraine's security services say, is between Igor Bezler, a pro-Russian rebel leader, and Vasili Geranin, a man Ukraine alleges to be a Russian intelligence agent. In the first line, Bezler allegedly says ""We have just shot down a plane."" (This line can also be translated to ""We have seen a plane shot down,"" but then both translations says ""cossacks"" —Russian volunteers—from Chernukhino road block shot it down.)

The second half of the audio is between two unidentified men, named ""Greek"" and ""Major.""

According to a transcription of the video, provided by the Kyiv Post, the rebel tells the Russian intelligence, “We have just shot down a plane.” Later in the tape, one rebel, Greek, asks if there are weapons on board. Major responds: “Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medicinal stuff, towels, toilet paper.”

“Are there any documents?” Greek asks the other. “Yes. Of an Indonesian student from Thompson University. Fuck.”

Here's the full translation of the video, provided by Kyiv Post:

Igor Bezler: We have just shot down a plane. Group Minera. It fell down beyond Yenakievo. Vasili Geranin: Pilots. Where are the pilots? IB: Gone to search for and photograph the plane. It's smoking. VG: How many minutes ago? IB: About 30 minutes ago.

After examining the site of the plane the terrorists come to the conclusion that they have shot down a civilian plane. The next part of the conversation took place about 40 minutes later.

“Major”: These are Chernukhin folks shot down the plane. From the Chernukhin check point. Those cossacks who are based in Chernukhino. “Greek”: Yes, Major. ""Major"": The plane fell apart in the air. In the area of Petropavlovskaya mine. The first “200” (code word for dead person). We have found the first “200”. A Civilian. Greek: Well, what do you have there? Major: In short, it was 100 percent a passenger (civilian) aircraft. Greek: Are many people there? Major: Holy sh*t! The debris fell right into the yards (of homes). Greek: What kind of aircraft? Major: I haven’t ascertained this. I haven’t been to the main sight. I am only surveying the scene where the first bodies fell. There are the remains of internal brackets, seats and bodies. Greek: Is there anything left of the weapon? Major: Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medicinal stuff, towels, toilet paper. Greek: Are there documents? Major: Yes, of one Indonesian student. From a university in Thompson. Fuck.

In a final phone call, included later in the recording, a rebel checks in with a Cossack commander.

Rebel: Regarding this plane that was downed in the Snizhne-Torez area. It turned out to be a passenger aircraft. It fell near Grabovo. A lot of bodies of women and children. Now the Cossacks are looking at all that.



Rebel: The TV said it was AN-26. A Ukrainian cargo plane. But Malaysia Airlines is written on it. What was it doing on Ukraine’s territory?



Cossack commander: It means they wanted to bring some spies to us. Fuck them. They should not fly, we are at war here.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing all 295 people on board. The plane was reportedly shot down in the embattled area, which for months has been the epicenter of conflict between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who's been accused of letting the months-long separatist movement grow rampant in Ukraine's east, pointed the finger at Ukraine itself on Thursday. He said the Flight 17 disaster would never have happened if Kiev hadn't renewed its anti-terrorist operation against the rebels in the country's east.

Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic in east Ukraine, told The New York Times it couldn't have been his group. “We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height,"" he said. Purgin, too, suggested the Ukrainians may have been behind the missile.

“Remember the Black Sea plane disaster,” he said, in reference to a 2001 incident in which the Ukrainian military shot down a Siberia Airlines passenger jet headed to Russia’s Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport from Tel Aviv, Israel.

524227209976745984,false,Up to 34 MILLION green cards and work permits... http://t.co/B4TPrt1QXj,http://drudge.tw/ZLF83x,True,Up to 34 MILLION blank 'green cards' and work permits to be ordered ahead of Obama illegal immigrant 'amnesty',"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services plans to seek a vendor to produce as many as 34 million blank work permits and 'green cards' – the paperwork that authorizes immigrants to live and work in the United States – as the White House prepares to issue an executive order after the Nov. 4 midterm elections.

According to a draft solicitation published online, the government agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum 4 million cards per year for five years, and 9 million in the early stages.

President Barack Obama has pledged that he will make a move on immigration reform this year. His original timetable called for a decision by the end of the summer.

Republicans have decried the plan as an 'amnesty' for millions of illegal immigrants, including hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have come across the U.S.-Mexico border this year.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE DOCUMENTS

'#Not1More': An immigration activist heckled President Barack Obama on Sunday as he spoke during a campaign event for Democratic Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown

Along with its solicitation for blank green cards and work permits, USCIS published images showing what the finished cards will look like

A draft RFP – a Request For Proposal – is typically published in advance so government contractors can prepare to submit their bids when the final version is published.

The draft came complete with photos of what the finished cards will look like.

Obama's high numbers of illegal immigration 'removals' – what used to be called 'deportation' – has earned him the nickname 'deportation president,' but most of those ejected border-crossers never get to the interior of the U.S.

Still, activists have protested his policies, including some who heckle his speeches. One yelled at him Sunday in the middle of a campaign stump speech supporting Democratic Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown.

A USCIS official told MailOnline on Monday that the draft was published 'in case the president makes the move we think he will,' but added that the agency's Document Management Division (DMD) is by no means committed to buying the materials.

A second official at the agency said the proposal was drafted as a contingency in case immigration reform legislation passes in Congress, not in anticipation of action from the White House.

Either way, the online draft explains that 'DMD requires card consumables for the production of USCIS' Permanent Resident Card (PRC) and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) cards.'

'These cards and related consumables, when assembled, become highly specialized and secure identification documents.'

And a successful bid, the draft solicitation says, will be able to support a 'potential ""surge"" in PRC and EAD card demand for up to 9M (9 million) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements.'

Advocates for Mexican and Central American immigrants have lambasted Obama for deporting illegal aliens even though the numbers are down sharply. This Sept. 8 protest in front of the White House featured a crying young boy (left) whose father was deported

Obama delayed his immigration action until after the midterm congressional election to avoid alienating law-and-order voters, but can afford to frustrate illegal imigrants – who can't legally cast ballots

Former State Department foreign service officer Jessica Vaughan, now an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart.com that the RFP 'seems to indicate that the president is contemplating an enormous executive action that is even more expansive than the plan that Congress rejected in the 'Gang of Eight' bill.'

That legislation, which passed in the U.S. Senate last year only to be stalled in the House of Representatives, was a broad reboot of American immigration policy that won support from a handful of Republicans.

In included a provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for so-called 'dreamers' – people living in the country illegally who were brought to Americans as children before June 15, 2007.

Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which he ultimately enacted without congressional support, uses the EAD cards as part of its implementation.

USCIS says it processed 862,000 EADs overall between January and June of this year.

But 'the guaranteed minimum for each ordering period is 4,000,000 cards,' according to the draft RFP.

'The estimated maximum for the entire contract is 34,000,000 cards.'",4579

Nathan Cirillo killed by gunman while guarding Canada's National War Memorial: http://t.co/hhmBnRUhnt http://t.co/fFF16rjzvK,http://abcn.ws/1zlgGGm,True,Canada PM Calls Parliament Shooting a 'Terrorist' Act,"A gunman fatally shot a Canadian soldier in an attack near the Parliament in what the prime minster called a ""terrorist"" act.

Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The gunman, who was shot and killed inside the Parliament building, has been identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian national. The slain soldier was Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, a reservist from Hamilton, Ontario.

Ottawa police first learned of the attacks after receiving multiple 911 calls at 9:52 a.m. about a shooting at the National War Memorial. Gunfire was later reported inside the Parliament building, less than 400 yards away. The Parliament building was put into lockdown as government officials hid in their offices while police searched the sprawling building.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a televised statement to the nation this evening about the incident. ""Let there be no misunderstanding, we will not be intimidated, Canada will never be intimidated,"" he said, noting this was the second attack against the country this week.

""In the days to come we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices,"" he added. Harper said the government would work to ""keep Canada safe and fight against terrorist organizations that are brutalizing so many people around the world in the hope of keeping their savagery from reaching our shores.""

Canada had already raised its national terrorism alert level today, following an incident Monday in which a Canadian soldier was killed in a hit-and-run by a man suspected to have been a radicalized jihadist.

Officials were investigating any terrorist ties to the suspect in today's shooting, but have not made any official statements. The prime minister provided no details on any such connections to the suspect.

Police initially believed that they were searching for more than one shooter, but tonight the Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said his police chief told him that there were no additional shooters.

""Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,"" Watson said.

Civic Hospital in Ottawa received four patients, including the wounded soldier who later died of his injuries.

Wayne Cuddington/Barcroft Media /Landov

""Apart from first patient, they had minor, non-life threatening injuries and remain in hospital at this time,"" hospital spokeswoman Hazel Harding told ABC News.

One of the patients was a Parliamentary Security officer who had been shot in the leg when the gunman entered the building, but the hospital said that it was an ""extremity gunshot wound"" and is ""quite stable."" Two others were brought to the hospital with unspecified injuries. All three were later released.

Witnesses told CTV they saw a man with long hair carrying a rifle at the war memorial and heard four shots fired at the soldier, who was guarding Canada's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

A witness told Canada's CBC the gunman then ran the short distance to Canada’s Parliament, jumped a wall, stopped a car at gunpoint and hijacked it. The gunman drove the car to the Centre Block on Parliament Hill where senior government leaders have their offices.

A CBC reporter inside the Canadian Parliament reported chaos there, hearing multiple gunshots. A lawmaker tweeted that more than 30 shots were heard inside Parliament's Center Block.

The gunman was shot dead by the Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers.

The gunfire prompted security forces to take Prime Minister Harper to a ""safe"" place not at Parliament Hill, his spokesperson said. Harper's usual office is in a building near the shooting site.

""The prime minister is safe and not on Parliament Hill and being briefed by security officials,"" his spokesman Jason MacDonald said.

In the initial chaos police believed that a shooting had also occurred at a nearby mall, but that proved to be false.

All military bases in Canada have been put on lock-down in response to the events in Ottawa, CTV reported. The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa followed suit.

Senior FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials told ABC News they are closely monitoring the situation. The White House said President Obama was briefed.

518620083342835712,false,Mass grave found in Mexico town where over 40 students went missing - http://t.co/s8FRYW0SU3,http://bit.ly/1vHxK4s,True,Governor says human remains found in Mexico mass grave had been burned,"Six burial pits discovered on outskirts of Iguala, where violence erupted last weekend and 43 students are missing

Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city have found burned human remains in mass graves on the edge of town, a lawyer for the families of 43 missing students said on Sunday.

Attorney Vidulfo Rosales told the Associated Press said the remains were those of an undetermined number of people, and were unidentified. Relatives of 37 of the missing young people have provided DNA samples over the past several days and will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students, the attorney said.

The students have been missing since last week in violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.

The governor of Guerrero, Ángel Aguirre, said on Saturday that the victims had been “savagely slaughtered”.

A group of protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo on Sunday demanding justice in the case. “You took them alive, we want them returned alive,” read a huge planner across the road that links Mexico City with Acapulco.

The father of one of the missing students expressed doubt that the remains belonged to the young people. He spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety.

Another father, Acapulco street vendor Jesús López, whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, on Sunday was getting ready to participate in a protest in the Pacific coast resort and said he hoped the remains weren’t those of the students.

Other relatives “told us that [the remains] were burned, and that they couldn’t be the kids,” López said. “But we’re really nervous.”

Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded on Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.

The Guerrero state prosecutor Iñaky Blanco did not say on Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.

“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal attorney general’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.

About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200km) south of Mexico City.

Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.

The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.

He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organised crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.

Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organised crime”. He also said his office was searching for the Iguala mayor, José Luis Abarca, and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.

The governor had charged earlier in the week that organised crime had infiltrated the city government.

Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.

The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests.

State prosecutors have said the first of the recent bloodshed occurred on 26 September when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a football team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.",4455
692765809425408000,non-rumor,Gerrymandering is even more infuriating when you can actually see it https://t.co/c3lOlCLssw https://t.co/wPymT8ubhM,http://bit.ly/1KHNL06,True,Gerrymandering Is Even More Infuriating When You Can Actually See It,"This story does not meet WIRED's journalistic standards as it reproduces material published elsewhere. We've chosen to keep the story online for archival purposes and the public record.

President Barack Obama spent the last chunk of his 2016 State of the Union Address talking about how to “fix our politics.” His first solution? Stop gerrymandering, the shaping of congressional districts to guarantee electoral outcomes. “We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around,” he said.

At least one geographer has heeded Obama’s call to action. Using data from the US Census Bureau, Alasdair Rae, a geographer and urban planner at Sheffield University, built maps of every congressional district—all 435 of them—to show just how screwed up they really are. When Rae maps them individually, removed from the context of their surrounding districts, you can really see the extent of the problem. “There are some shapes that are quite egregious,” Rae says.

The worst offender? “North Carolina was and is often used as the archetype,” Rae says. His map shows the state's 12th district undulating northwest to southeast like an eight-bit snake. Now, technically gerrymandering is against the law—unless topography gets in the way, districts are supposed to be contiguous regions. But the 12th...well, look at it. Its irregular blocks of land all connect, but only at their corners. Legislators call this ""point contiguity,"" and when you see it on a map, you can bet something dicey is going on.

Even crazier, though, gerrymandering used to be worse. Before the Supreme Court barred redistricting along racial lines, the shapes on the map were even more tortured. Rae's maps show this, too. North Carolina's 12th looked like a string during the 103rd Congress (1993-1995) and a collection of tangrams during the 106th (1999-2001), when it finally morphed into its present-day snake—albeit one that has grown increasingly slender at each redistricting, from the 107th Congress (2001-2003) through the 114th. “The 114th Congress, it looks ridiculous,” Rae says. “But actually, when you compare it to the one of 20 years ago, it looks relatively sane.”

Alasdair Rae

Weirdly-shaped congressional districts aren't necessarily gerrymandered. Illinois’s 4th Congressional District looks like a jagged horseshoe. Mathematically, it looks like the worst example of gerrymandering in the US. But it's actually a logical, urban Latino district. “These people belong to the same media market. They watch the same television shows, shop at the same stores, and have the same concerns with the police,” says Michael Li, a policy expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. What’s more, if you didn’t carve this winding, circular district out of its urban surroundings in Chicago, the people who lived there would find it harder to make their voices heard in politics. Despite those Supreme Court cases, sometimes cities have to take ethnicity into account.

Alasdair Rae

More data can only help. The next step for district maps could be geographic features, or the names of urban neighborhoods. “One might also want to see something like population overlaid,” says Ruth Rosenholtz, head of the Perceptual Science Group at MIT. ""I can imagine there could conceivably be benign reasons for drawing complicated boundaries if the population was really not distributed evenly.""

Rae's maps alone won't end gerrymandering. But the ease with which he made them might hint at some weapons in the fight. In Florida, for example, when the Supreme Court ordered the congressional map redrawn, the trial court ignored legislator ideas in favor of a proposal from Common Cause and the League of Women Voters. In Virginia, after the state supreme court found a district unconstitutional, the court’s special master received proposals from anyone who was interested—crowdmapping!—in coming up with a new version. Today, at least five more states have ballot initiatives calling for independent commissions to take over redistricting from political parties. “If you want to get equal and fair representation in Congress or in any legislative body,"" Rae says, ""then sometimes you’re going to have to draw some weird shapes on maps,” The fight against gerrymandering is the purplest of purple issues. It's not Republicans versus Democrats, but voters—and mapmakers—versus both.",4433

Four US Olympic gold medal swimmers who said they had been robbed in Rio de Janeiro were not victims of crime, the head of the city's civil police says.

Fernando Veloso told reporters that one or more of the men had instead vandalised part of a petrol station and then offered to pay for the damage.

The Americans paid and left after armed security guards intervened, he said.

One guard had justifiably drawn his gun after one of the swimmers began behaving erratically, Mr Veloso added.

Three of the swimmers remain in Brazil. The fourth, Ryan Lochte, returned to the US on Monday.

Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were prevented from leaving Brazil at Rio de Janeiro airport on Wednesday night and have since been questioned by police. Team-mate James Feigen has also remained in Brazil and says he is co-operating with the authorities.

Five times Lochte made a splash

The swimmers, who have repeatedly changed their accounts of what happened, could ""in theory"" face charges of giving false testimony and vandalism, Mr Veloso told reporters during a news conference at Rio police headquarters.

Mr Lochte was ""very angry because he was intoxicated"" during the incident, he said.

The people of Rio were unhappy to see the reputation of their city damaged, Mr Veloso said, adding: ""We are dealing with important public figures who influence others and should know how to comport themselves... An apology would be welcomed.""

Earlier, a Rio 2016 spokesman had tried to make light of the case.

""These kids tried to have fun, they tried to represent their country to the best of their abilities,"" Mario Andrada told reporters.

""They competed under gigantic pressure. Let's give these kids a break. Sometime you take actions that you later regret.

""They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on.""

How the story evolved

Sunday 14 August

Ryan Lochte's mother tells US media her son has been robbed in Rio de Janeiro

Mr Lochte gives an account of the events, saying he and the other swimmers were returning by taxi from a club in the early hours of the morning when they were robbed at gunpoint by men who forced the vehicle to pull over

The swimmers do not report the incident to police or to the US Olympic Committee, and police officers only get involved after seeing TV reports

Monday 15 August

Police investigating the case say there are inconsistencies in the men's accounts

Tuesday 16 August

CCTV footage emerges of the men's return to the athletes' village showing them laughing and joking, and handing over wallets and phones as they go through the security screens

Wednesday 17 August

Ryan Lochte admits there were inaccuracies in his original account of being robbed at gunpoint, but vehemently denies making the story up

Judge orders that the passports of the four men be seized before it emerges that Mr Lochte has already left for the US

Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger taken off a US-bound plane at Rio de Janeiro airport

Thursday 18 August

Brazilian police sources tell media outlets that the men invented a story about a robbery to disguise a dispute over a damaged bathroom door at a petrol station in Barra da Tijuca, 16km (10 miles) from the Olympic Park

CCTV video emerges that appears to show the athletes being detained and ordered to sit on the ground

Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger enter a Rio police station for questioning

Head of Rio's civil police emphatically denies a robbery took place, saying the case centred around an incident of vandalism and payment for damage

727116900983934976,unverified,. @target stock plunges in early days of @AmericanFamAssc boycott. https://t.co/HugeQYvFN8,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/04/29/one-million-americans-vow-to-boycott-target-over-transgender-bathrooms.html,True,One million Americans vow to boycott Target over transgender bathrooms,"More than one million people have decided they will no longer buy their Nutter Butters or Wet Wipes at Target.

The American Family Association launched a boycott of the nation’s second largest retailer a week ago – over Target’s corporate policy allowing men who identify as women to use the bathrooms and fitting rooms of their choosing.

Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!

“We believe that everyone – every team member, every guest, and every community – deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally,” the company wrote in a statement. “Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.”

American Family Association, one of the most prominent and respected family advocacy groups in the nation, warned that Target’s policy puts women and children in danger.

“Nearly everyone has a mother, wife, daughter or friend who is put in jeopardy by this policy,” AFA President Tim Wildmon said. “Predators and voyeurs would take advantage of the policy to prey on those who are vulnerable.”

And it’s pretty clear that more than a million customers agree with the American Family Association.

“Everybody knows it’s wrong for men to use the same bathrooms and fitting rooms with little girls,” Wildmon told me. “Target has decided they don’t care about the vast majority. They only care about the tiny, tiny minority.”

The American Family Association stressed that their boycott has nothing to do with the transgender community.

“We want to make it very clear that AFA does not believe the transgender community poses this danger to the wider public,” Wildmon said. “Rather, this misguided and reckless policy provides a possible gateway for predators who are out there.”

I’ve never been one to tell you how to spend your hard-earned money. It’s not my place. But I don’t mind telling you that the Starnes family has joined the boycott.

Granted, Target has every right to determine its corporate policies. But I also have a right to buy my Cocoa Puffs at a place that respects common sense.

For the sake of inclusivity, would Target allow a 16-year-old who identifies as a 21-year-old to purchase a six-pack of beer? Would Target provide a senior citizen discount to a 30-year-old who identifies as a 70-year-old?

Wildmon told me the Target boycott struck a nerve with a significant section of the country. Many people have grown tired of Hollywood and Big Business trying to bully and intimidate local governments.

“Corporate America must stop bullying people who disagree with the radical Left agenda to remake society into their progressive image,” he said. “This boycott is a reaction to the bullying we’ve seen in places like North Carolina and Mississippi.”

Among the most vocal supporters of AFA’s boycott is evangelical leader Franklin Graham.

“A man shouldn’t be able to enter the women’s restroom or dressing room because he says he ‘feels like a woman today,’” Graham wrote on Facebook. “That’s ridiculous. The fact is, gender identity isn’t something we choose or feel. We are the sex God created us to be – male or female. How a person feels doesn’t change the facts.”

It’s as if an anatomical fog has rolled across the fruited plain – causing befuddlement in bathroom stalls from coast to coast.

So perhaps I can provide some clarity to the Great Latrine Wars of 2016. Those of you with man-parts should use the men’s room and those of you with lady-parts should use the ladies room.

I suspect that right about now you’re probably thinking your friendly neighborhood columnist is a bit politically incorrect. Well, it’s true – I am.

When I was growing up we just had boys and girls (him and her, not ze and zir). Our bathroom choices were limited to our God-given plumbing.

So maybe Target ought to consider going old school.

It’s pretty much a fool-proof system -- unless you happen to be at Long John Silver’s – and then the men should use the buoys room and the ladies should use the gull’s room.

And no matter if you identify as a him or her or ze or zir -- be sure to courtesy flush.

692759090469212160,non-rumor,Half A Sleeve Of Oreos Lost In House Fire https://t.co/u25tkXu6ng https://t.co/aYYBhjGPL3,http://onion.com/1nATzUx,True,Half A Sleeve Of Oreos Lost In House Fire,"NEWARK, DE—A three-alarm fire tore through a family home on Newark's East Side early Saturday morning, completely gutting the two-story residence and tragically claiming a half-sleeve of Oreo cookies that was trapped inside a cupboard.

""This was one of the fastest moving and most destructive residential fires we've seen in a very long time,"" said Newark Fire Department chief Al Pascarelli, who did not mention the partial box of chocolate sandwich cookies that perished in the intense heat and towering flames. ""By the time we arrived, the building was already completely engulfed. It just went up so fast, there wasn't anything we could do except try to contain it.""

""Given the extent of the fire, there was no hope of entering the home to perform a search and rescue,"" continued Pascarelli, tactfully avoiding the grisly details of the lost treats' final moments. ""We will continue to work with law enforcement and the county coroner to determine the exact cause of this terrible tragedy.""

Pascarelli confirmed the fire broke out around 12:20 a.m. at a Grove Street property occupied by Mike and Sheila Donlin, three young children, and as many as six perfectly good, untouched Oreo cookies, all of which were present at the time of the blaze. The rapidly spreading conflagration may have been sparked by faulty electrical wiring in the kitchen and likely trapped the tasty cookie-and-cream treats inside the pantry as the blistering-hot flames encircled the snacks and, finally, incinerated them.

At press time, it remained unknown whether the lost cookies were of the original variety, the kind dipped in fudge, Double Stuf, or a St. Patrick's day seasonal pack featuring green, mint-flavored cream filling.

The tragic demise of the name-brand snacks has left the community in shock. Numerous residents could be seen gathering beside the still-smoldering rubble Saturday to comfort one another and pay their respects to those lost, which, in addition to the Oreos, may have included a stash of Kudos-brand chocolate-chip granola bars, a mostly full bag of Rold Gold pretzel rods, and a jar of Skippy smooth peanut butter that may have been used for dipping.

""This is awful—just awful,"" said neighbor Karen Beliveau, 43, who appeared visibly shaken as she struggled with the horrifying reality that the Oreo cookies were truly gone and would never get to be munched on and enjoyed. ""My heart just breaks for that poor family. I can't even imagine the pain and heartache their loved ones must be going through.""

""My God,"" added Beliveau, pausing to compose herself. ""I don't know how you even begin to move on from something like this.""

According to experts, the Oreos likely suffered a grotesque end. Although the sleeve may have provided initial protection from the acrid smoke, the extreme temperatures—which probably exceeded 1,000 degrees—would have eventually caused the cookies' cream centers to boil from the inside out while the melting packaging entombed them in a scalding coat of liquefied plastic.

Additionally, the sweet sugar within the snack itself likely added fuel to the fire, resulting in all the cookies fusing into a single fire-blackened mass and potentially making it impossible for authorities to identify their charred remains.

Unlike his unfortunate cream-filled cookies, property owner Mike Donlin managed to survive the blaze after a neighbor reportedly dragged him from the burning house in the moments before it collapsed in flames. When contacted for comment, the now tragically Oreo-less Donlin, who is currently recovering from burns and smoke inhalation, said words ""can't even begin to express"" the level of anguish and devastation he felt.

""Everything I cared about was taken from me in an instant,"" said the profoundly distraught 37-year-old father, apparently racked with overwhelming guilt and regret at not having reached his helpless Oreos, clutched them tightly to his chest, and delivered them to safety by crawling beneath the thick smoke. ""I just can't believe my [Oreo cookies]—my own [chocolatey snack-time treats]—are gone. They were so young, they never had a chance to [be dunked in milk and eaten]. This is the worst thing any [Oreo-lover] could ever face.""

""All I can ask is why?"" Donlin added before breaking down and sobbing uncontrollably. ""Why not me instead?""",4379

One man is brain-dead and another five people are in hospital after an experimental drug was administered to 90 people in a French clinical trial.

There is no known antidote to the drug, the chief neuroscientist at the hospital in Rennes said.

Of the six men in hospital, three could have permanent brain damage, Gilles Edan added.

Reports that the drug is a cannabis-based painkiller have been denied by the health ministry.

A fifth man is suffering from neurological problems and a sixth man is being monitored but is not in a critical condition, Mr Edan said.

The trial, which involved taking the drug orally and has now been suspended, was conducted by a private laboratory in Rennes.

The experimental drug was manufactured by the Portuguese company Bial.

All those who volunteered for the trial have been recalled and the Paris prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.

Health Minister Marisol Touraine pledged to ""get to the bottom... of this tragic accident"".

""I was overwhelmed by their distress"" she told reporters. ""Their lives have been brutally turned upside down"".

Analysis

This is the bitter price of the new medicines we take for granted. Testing such experimental drugs, at the cutting edge of science, can never be completely risk-free.

The safety and effectiveness of these drugs are rigorously tested in animals. The risks are low but there must still be a leap of faith when they are tried in people for the first time.

This trial has been taking place since July without such major events being reported. Generally in Phase I trials the dose is increased slowly over time, which could be why the side-effects are appearing now.

The hospitalised men started taking the drug regularly on 7 January and began showing severe side-effects three days later.

Three of the volunteers are now facing a lifetime of disability in this ""accident of exceptional gravity"".

It is a high price to pay, but thousands of people do safely take part in similar trials each year.

The trial was conducted by Biotrial, a French-based company with an international reputation which has carried out thousands of trials since it was set up in 1989.

In a message on its website, the company said that ""serious adverse events related to the test drug"" had occurred.

The company insisted that ""international regulations and Biotrial's procedures were followed at every stage"".

According to the health ministry, the adverse effects occurred on Thursday.

Clinical trials

Trials typically have three phases to assess a new medicine for safety and effectiveness

Phase I tests for safety. A small number of people, sometimes healthy, and sometimes with a medical condition, are given a tiny dose of the drug under careful supervision, not to test if the drug works, but in order to check for any side effects

Phase II sees the drug given to people who have a medical condition to see if it does indeed help them

Phase III trials are only for medicines or devices that have already passed the first two stages, and involve them being compared to existing treatments or a placebo. The trials often last a year or more, involving several thousand patients

Has drug trial safety improved?

German medics challenge new EU clinical drug trials

Why some new drugs cost so much

The study was a Phase I clinical trial, in which healthy volunteers take the medication to evaluate the safety of its use, the ministry said.

Before any new medicine can be given to patients, detailed information about how it works and how safe it is must be collected.

Clinical trials are the key to getting that data - and without volunteers to take part in the trials, there would be no new treatments for serious diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and arthritis.

Every year around the world thousands of people take part in clinical trials but incidents like this are very rare, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris.

New EU regulations to speed up clinical drug trials and streamline testing procedures across the 28-nation bloc are due to take effect in 2018.",4376

As part of a deal signed last week in Washington DC between the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry and FEMA, Russian officials will provide “security at mass events” in the United States, a scenario that won’t sit well with Americans wary of foreign assets operating on US soil.

According to a press release by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense and Emergencies, US and Russian officials met on June 25 at the 17th Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations.

In addition to agreeing with FEMA to “exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters,” the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry will also be providing “security at mass events” in the United States.

This suggests that events designated as “National Special Security Events” by the Department of Homeland Security, which include the Super Bowl, international summits such as the G8 and presidential inaugurations, will now rely partly on Russian authorities to provide security.

The meeting last week also agreed on the conclusion that US and Russian emergency authorities will increase their co-operation, “in order to respond efficiently to all kinds of disasters.”

The use of foreign troops or other officials in a law enforcement capacity providing “security” inside the United States is illegal under Posse Comitatus. Capt. William Geddes of the U.S. Army Reserve acknowledged last year that it is against federal law to use US troops to conduct police patrols, despite the fact that such occurrences are becoming increasingly common. The use of foreign troops is an even more clear cut violation of Posse Comitatus.

Last year we reported on how Russian troops were invited to the US as part of a Fort Carson, Colorado drill focused around anti-terror training. Aside from learning how to target terrorists in America, the Russian soldiers were also out in the local community attending a baseball game in Colorado Springs.

As Mac Slavo writes, “Rumors have circulated for years about the possibility of foreign troops being deployed on U.S. soil in the event of a widespread declaration of a national emergency. For quite some time there have been anecdotal reports to support the claim that the U.N., Russia and other nations would be used in a policing capacity should some critical event befall our nation.”

“The fear should such a scenario take place has been that these soldiers would act under the banner of their own flags, ignoring the fundamental protections afforded to our citizens, leaving Americans under the jurisdiction of people who don’t speak our language or respect our fundamental rights to self defense, to be secure in our homes, and to be presumed innocent in the eyes of the law.”

Concerns about foreign troops being used on US soil have lingered ever since the release of State Department Publication 7277, which is a blueprint for the harmonization of US and Russian forces under a framework of United Nations-led global government.

Back in 2008 it was also reported that US and Canadian authorities had signed an agreement that would pave the way to using each other’s militaries on both sides of the border “during an emergency”.

Alex Jones has documented foreign troops being trained on U.S. soil to deal with “insurgents” since the late 1990’s as part of “urban warfare drills”.

Back in July 2010, our reporters covered the Operation Vigilant Guard exercises in Chicago which involved Polish troops training alongside U.S. National Guard troops in drills focused around raiding terrorists and drug dealers.

According to SFC Mark Ballard of the Illinois National Guard, the Polish forces were “integrating into some of the civil military units that are participating in this exercise” as part of Illinois’ partnership with the Republic of Poland, a relationship based around “integrative training” and blending military and civilian forces in the event of a national emergency, as well as making this process of integration with foreign troops more “visible”.

692357775859564544,non-rumor,Neurotic Woman Turns To Neurotic Friends For Support https://t.co/yhftR0Zw0u https://t.co/dRj2oSGxs4,http://onion.com/1Nzc9Rw,True,Neurotic Woman Turns To Neurotic Friends For Support,"ANNAPOLIS, MD–In times of crisis, local neurotic Beth Haller is thankful to have a support network to turn to: her group of equally neurotic friends.

""My friends are so important to me,"" said 36-year-old Haller, tearing up as she spoke. ""They're always there for me, and I do my best to be there for them.""

Haller and her three closest friends, Shannon Olbrich, Jennifer Beech, and Leslie Chevik, are in near-constant contact, sharing stories of hardship over the phone, at local coffee shops, and during intense weekly get-togethers over multiple bottles of wine–a Sunday-night ritual they refer to as their ""recharging sessions.""

""Do you think my wearing my hair like this is some sort of subconscious cry for attention?"" Haller asked the trio of fellow neurotics at a recent recharging session. ""I know I said I wanted to be happier with my self-image, but then I realized, how can I be truly comfortable with the inner me when the outer me doesn't match my image of the me I see when I form a mental picture of the person I think I truly am?""

""Oh, totally,"" Olbrich said. ""That's why I got the interior of my car reupholstered. Something just wasn't right until I did. But now I wish I would have gotten black. Do you think the tan looks stupid? At first, I really liked it, but now I think maybe it just looks cheap. You don't think so, do you?""

Haller said that close friends ""have literally saved [her] life"" on countless occasions.

""I know this isn't how it's supposed to be, and I feel guilty about it, but my friends are more like a family to me than my actual family,"" Haller said through subsequent tears. ""That's okay, right? I mean, I love my family, but Jen, Shannon, and Leslie are the ones I spend real Q.T. with.""

Though members of Haller's family care about her well-being, most maintain little contact with her.

""I just couldn't stand it anymore,"" said Haller's sister, Deborah Barkum, who lives in nearby Edgewater. ""I'd get frantic phone calls in the middle of the night about some meaningless comment her boss made. She'd drop by for dinner, and I'd spend six hours listening to her go on about how she has to find a new apartment because the landlord refuses to do anything about the dogs down the hall. I finally made a rule: I'll talk to her on weekends, but that's it.""

For years, Barkum was frustrated by her sister's emotional neediness, but most of Haller's neurotic behavior is now addressed by her cadre of neurotic friends, from whom she receives constant affirmation and reinforcement. As a bonus for Haller, her friends' own neuroses make it easier for her to view her perpetual state of anxiety as normal.

""Beth is such a special person, so complex and multi-layered,"" the Prozac-taking Chevik said. ""I'm happy to be there for her when she needs a shoulder to cry on.""

Advertisement

""It is truly amazing how she's held on after the split,"" Beech said of Haller's 1991 divorce, still a major source of pain, heartache, and confusion for her 10 years later.

Beech herself knows the pain of love lost. Six years ago, she dated a man for two months and then suddenly never heard from him again. According to Haller, the experience has made it impossible for her friend to trust any man.

""Poor Jen,"" Haller said. ""She was badly wounded by someone who said he'd call and then never did, and, as a result, she's built up this wall to protect her from ever leaving herself vulnerable like that again.""

Advertisement

Added Haller: ""It seems like some of us have our load to bear in life, and no matter what we do, it never gets any lighter.""

Haller was cryptically alluding to any one of her own crises, including: her strained relationship with her mother, caused by an offhand comment her mother made in 1979 about never having expected to have a third child; her indecision about whether to return to school to receive a Masters degree in English; her ""demeaning and demoralizing"" research-assistant job, one of the few positions in publishing that a divorced woman her age can get; her home computer's hard-drive crash, which wiped out nearly five pages of notes for the novella she intends to write someday; and her new relationship with a man who is obviously a commitment-phobe, begging the question of what is the point of even proceeding to a third date.",4337

Obama added that credible evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile from an area controlled by pro-Russia rebels and called for an investigation to determine those responsible.

--

A commercial airplane carrying almost 300 people crashed in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, just 20 miles from the border with Russia. Ukraine's Interior Ministry advisor said all passengers on board have been killed.

Hours after the crash, dozens of armed rebels patrolled the area and controlled traffic flow along a dusty village backroad leading to the crash site, where smoke fumes and the smell of aviation fuel filled the air.

""It was like ground zero, total devastation,"" a local firefighter told VICE News. ""There are no survivors.""

The Boeing 777 — the same model as the Malaysia Airlines plane that went missing earlier this year — traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was carrying 298 people. It crashed near the Ukrainian town of Grabovo, north of Torez, in the Donetsk region, shortly before it was to enter Russian airspace. Malaysia Airlines confirmed they lost contact of the plane when it was over Ukrainian airspace and that its last known location was somewhere over Donetsk.

Working side-by-side with emergency services, rebels clad in military fatigues sifted through the ash and charred plane wreckage. According to some local reports, the rebels now claim that they are in possession of the black box that contains vital information about the final moments of the flight.

Deputy Prime Minister of the Donetsk People's Republic Andrei Purgin told Russian news agency Interfax that militants were on the site and planning to hand over the recordings of the plane to Moscow. ""Of course, we most likely will give them to the Interstate Aviation Committee, to Moscow,"" Purgin said. ""High-level experts, who will be able to determine exactly the reason of the catastrophe, work there.""

Speaking to VICE News at the scene, a pro-Russia gunman named Yuri refused to confirm or deny reports that the rebels had taken control of the area. He said that they were there to ""protect"" and keep the ""order.""

All VICE News coverage of Ukraine. See it here.

According to Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Minister, and local reports, the plane was shot down by pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine, though rebels have denied involvement in the crash and have blamed it on the Ukrainian military. There were reportedly no Russian citizens aboard the flight. Gerashchenko said on his Facebook page that the rebels used a Buk anti-aircraft system to shoot down the plane, which was flying at about 32,000 feet.

A Buk anti-aircraft system is a sophisticated surface-to-air missile that rebels in eastern Ukraine acquired in June, according to Itar-Tass. US intelligence officials have confirmed that a surface-to-air missile was used, but have not determined who shot it.

Ukraine's President Petro Peroshenko said the Ukrainian military did not shoot down the plane.

""We do not exclude that this plane was shot down, and we stress that the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not take action against any airborne targets,"" he said. ""We are sure that those who are guilty in this tragedy will be held responsible.""

Peroshenko added that the incident was ""a terrorist act.""

Russia's Defense Ministry denied accusations that pro-Russia rebels were responsible for the crash, calling the claims ""absurd.""

(CNSNews.com) - The Internal Revenue Service sent 23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040 to “unauthorized” alien workers who all used the same address in Atlanta, Ga., in 2011, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).

That was not the only Atlanta address theoretically used by thousands of “unauthorized” alien workers receiving millions in federal tax refunds in 2011. In fact, according to a TIGTA audit report published last year, four of the top ten addresses to which the IRS sent thousands of tax refunds to “unauthorized” aliens were in Atlanta.

The IRS sent 11,284 refunds worth a combined $2,164,976 to unauthorized alien workers at a second Atlanta address; 3,608 worth $2,691,448 to a third; and 2,386 worth $1,232,943 to a fourth.

Other locations on the IG’s Top Ten list for singular addresses that were theoretically used simultaneously by thousands of unauthorized alien workers, included an address in Oxnard, Calif, where the IRS sent 2,507 refunds worth $10,395,874; an address in Raleigh, North Carolina, where the IRS sent 2,408 refunds worth $7,284,212; an address in Phoenix, Ariz., where the IRS sent 2,047 refunds worth $5,558,608; an address in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where the IRS sent 1,972 refunds worth $2,256,302; an address in San Jose, Calif., where the IRS sent 1,942 refunds worth $5,091,027; and an address in Arvin, Calif., where the IRS sent 1,846 refunds worth $3,298,877.

Since 1996, the IRS has issued what it calls Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to two classes of persons: 1) non-resident aliens who have a tax liability in the United States, and 2) aliens living in the United States who are “not authorized to work in the United States.”

The IRS has long known it was giving these numbers to illegal aliens, and thus facilitating their ability to work illegally in the United States. For example, the Treasury Inspector General’s Semiannual Report to Congress published on Oct. 29, 1999—nearly fourteen years ago—specifically drew attention to this problem.

“The IRS issues Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to undocumented aliens to improve nonresident alien compliance with tax laws. This IRS practice seems counter-productive to the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s (INS) mission to identify undocumented aliens and prevent unlawful alien entry,” TIGTA warned in that long-ago report.

The inspector general’s 2012 audit report on the IRS’s handling of ITINs was spurred by two IRS employees who went to members of Congress ""alleging that IRS management was requiring employees to assign Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) even when the applications were fraudulent.”

In an August 2012 press release accompanying the audit report, TIGTA said the report “validated” the complaints of the IRS employees.

“TIGTA’s audit found that IRS management has not established adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the assignment of an ITIN to individuals submitting questionable applications,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. “Even more troubling, TIGTA found an environment which discourages employees from detecting fraudulent applications.”

In addition to the 23,994 tax refunds worth a combined $46,378,040 that the IRS sent to a single address in Atlanta, the IG also discovered that the IRS had assigned 15,796 ITINs to unauthorized aliens who presumably used a single Atlanta address.

The IRS, according to TIGTA, also assigned ITINs to 15,028 unauthorized aliens presumably using a single address in Dallas, Texas, and 10,356 to unauthorized aliens presumably living at a single address in Atlantic City, N.J.

Perhaps the most remarkable act of the IRS was this: It assigned 6,411 ITINs to unauthorized aliens presumably using a single address in Morganton, North Carolina. According to the 2010 Census, there were only 16,681 people in Morganton. So, for the IRS to have been correct in issuing 6,411 ITINS to unauthorized aliens at a single address in Morganton it would have meant that 38 percent of the town’s total population were unauthorized alien workers using a single address.

TIGTA said there were 154 addresses around the country that appeared on 1,000 or more ITIN applications made to the IRS.",4333

Mixture

RATING

Mixture

WHAT'S TRUE

Target confirmed a chain-wide policy allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identity.

WHAT'S FALSE

Target made the decision due to pressure placed on the chain by President Obama or LGBT groups; Target announced ""transgender restrooms.""

ORIGIN

Public debate around transgender individuals and bathroom use hit a fever pitch in April 2016, largely due to the controversial passage of HB 2 (otherwise known as the “bathroom bill“) in North Carolina. On 19 April 2016, Target released a statement confirming a new policy about transgender customers and bathrooms:

Continuing to Stand for Inclusivity Recent debate around proposed laws in several states has reignited a national conversation around inclusivity. So earlier this week, we reiterated with our team members where Target stands and how our beliefs are brought to life in how we serve our guests. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target. It’s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day. We believe that everyone—every team member, every guest, and every community—deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination. In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.

Bathroom controversies weren’t new in April 2016, but HB2, which was by far the highest profile legislation of that nature, provoked a huge response across the country. Target was not the first large and well-known entity to clarify its policy about transgender bathroom use, and the brand responded to some feedback on Twitter:

@Kusau Everyone is welcome at Target. ❤️ — Target (@Target) April 20, 2016

Not all of the public’s response was positive. Target’s Facebook page was flooded with critical responses similar to the (heavily satirized) comments that appeared when the chain announced gender-neutral toy aisles:

Some misinformation also circulated about the development. The web site The Political Insider reported that the retailer released the statement under pressure from the President and LGBT groups:

Target just caved to pressure from the Obama administration and liberal activists. They have announced that any “transgendered” person can use the bathroom in their stores, according to the gender they associate with. Now in Target stores, men are allowed to use the restroom next to your daughter. Once called perverted, this is now a “civil right.”

No information we could find substantiated the claim that Target was pressured to institute the chain-wide policy, and no retailers of a similar size and scope have reported any organized push to enact similar policies. While HB2 is an enforceable law, Target’s bathroom policy is simply a brand’s policy decision based on its own ethics and belief structure.

It is true that Target announced on 19 April 2016 that transgender shoppers and staffers were welcome to use the bathroom that best matched their gender identities. However, neither President Obama nor any groups appeared to have forced the retailer’s hand in issuing the policy, and no “transgender bathrooms” were included in the details of the announcement.",4327
778949749156245504,unverified,"""A black man who runs from police merely might be trying to avoid the recurring indignity of being profiled"" https://t.co/6oUQMsXc2F",http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/21/494900984/black-men-may-have-cause-to-run-from-police-massachusetts-high-court-says,True,"Black Men May Have Cause To Run From Police, Massachusetts High Court Says","Black Men May Have Cause To Run From Police, Massachusetts High Court Says

A black man who runs from police shouldn't necessarily be considered suspicious — and merely might be trying to avoid ""the recurring indignity of being racially profiled,"" the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court says.

The court made that observation as it overturned the conviction of a man who was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit after he ran from a Boston police officer who, the court says in its ruling, ""lacked reasonable suspicion"" to try to stop him in the first place.

As member station WBUR reports, the court cited ""Boston police data and a 2014 report by the ACLU of Massachusetts that found blacks were disproportionately stopped by the city's police"" as it threw out the 2011 gun conviction of Jimmy Warren.

The court also cited ""a factual irony"" in how flight from police is viewed and said that in this instance, a Boston police officer decided to approach Warren and a companion despite important factors: The officer was looking for three, not two, suspects, and he had been given only vague descriptions that the suspects were wearing dark clothing and a hoodie.

Some 30 minutes after the crime was reported, Officer Luis Anjos was driving in his police cruiser when he spotted Warren and another man, rolled down the passenger-side window, and yelled, ""Hey guys, wait a minute.""

Rather than talk to the officer, the court said, ""the two men made eye contact with Anjos, turned around, and jogged down a path"" into a park. They were apprehended after Anjos called for assistance.

The court wrote:

""Where a suspect is under no obligation to respond to a police officer's inquiry, we are of the view that flight to avoid that contact should be given little, if any, weight as a factor probative of reasonable suspicion. Otherwise, our long-standing jurisprudence establishing the boundary between consensual and obligatory police encounters will be seriously undermined.""

Discussing how a person's race can also be a factor, the Massachusetts court said it's important to consider a recent Boston Police Department report ""documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston.""

Noting that black men were more likely to be targeted by Boston police for encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations, the judges wrote, ""We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop.""

But the judges went on to say that flight alone does not prove ""a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt.""

The targeting of black males by police for ""field interrogation and observation"" — FIO — changes the equation, the court said, and ""suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt.""

Some of the changes have been relatively simple, such as Evans urging officers to hand out business cards after encounters with the public. But others have been more complicated: Earlier this month, a judge sided with Evans in his dispute with the city's largest police union over the commissioner's plan to institute a police body camera program.

A black man who runs from police shouldn't necessarily be considered suspicious — and merely might be trying to avoid ""the recurring indignity of being racially profiled,"" the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court says.

The court made that observation as it overturned the conviction of a man who was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit after he ran from a Boston police officer who, the court says in its ruling, ""lacked reasonable suspicion"" to try to stop him in the first place.

As member station WBUR reports, the court cited ""Boston police data and a 2014 report by the ACLU of Massachusetts that found blacks were disproportionately stopped by the city's police"" as it threw out the 2011 gun conviction of Jimmy Warren.

The court also cited ""a factual irony"" in how flight from police is viewed and said that in this instance, a Boston police officer decided to approach Warren and a companion despite important factors: The officer was looking for three, not two, suspects, and he had been given only vague descriptions that the suspects were wearing dark clothing and a hoodie.

Some 30 minutes after the crime was reported, Officer Luis Anjos was driving in his police cruiser when he spotted Warren and another man, rolled down the passenger-side window, and yelled, ""Hey guys, wait a minute.""

Rather than talk to the officer, the court said, ""the two men made eye contact with Anjos, turned around, and jogged down a path"" into a park. They were apprehended after Anjos called for assistance.

The court wrote:

""Where a suspect is under no obligation to respond to a police officer's inquiry, we are of the view that flight to avoid that contact should be given little, if any, weight as a factor probative of reasonable suspicion. Otherwise, our long-standing jurisprudence establishing the boundary between consensual and obligatory police encounters will be seriously undermined.""

Discussing how a person's race can also be a factor, the Massachusetts court said it's important to consider a recent Boston Police Department report ""documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston.""

Noting that black men were more likely to be targeted by Boston police for encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations, the judges wrote, ""We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop.""

But the judges went on to say that flight alone does not prove ""a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt.""

The targeting of black males by police for ""field interrogation and observation"" — FIO — changes the equation, the court said, and ""suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt.""

The court wrote:

""Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity. Given this reality for black males in the city of Boston, a judge should, in appropriate cases, consider the report's findings in weighing flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.""

Kobani Kurds Report ISIS Using Chem Weapons!
http://t.co/eJRinOjbuT http://t.co/uKINEg6j3F",http://goo.gl/r2i8Om,True,Islamic State said to use chemical weapons on Kurds,"Kurdish health officials and activists in the besieged town of Kobani claim to possess evidence that Islamic State operatives have used chemical agents as a weapon on at least one occasion during clashes with Kurdish fighters along Syria’s northern border.

According to several reports, which were compiled by the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center’s Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center, the use of the toxins by the Islamic State took place on July 12 in the village of Avdiko, 10 days after the rogue Jihadi group launched an offensive on the Kobani enclave, near the Turkish border.

Nisan Ahmed, the health minister of the Kurdish authority in Kobani, said that in a number of photographs showing Kurdish fighters who had been killed during the battle in Avdiko, no visible wounds or external bleeding could be seen on the bodies, whereas severe burns and white spots were clearly visible. Ahmed asserted that the (graphic) photos, which were later obtained and posted online by the Middle East Review of International Affairs journal, suggest the fighters had died as a result of exposure to chemical toxins.

While it still remains unclear whether chemical agents were actually used by the Islamic State, Israeli experts who examined the photographs said the wounds, which included severe peeling of the skin and heavy blistering, suggested the Kurdish fighters had been exposed to mustard gas, the GLORIA Center reported. The experts added, however, that more data was needed to form a definitive conclusion.

In early July, shortly before the attack on Kobani, officials in Iraq reported that the Islamic State had taken control of a vast former chemical weapons facility northwest of Baghdad, where 2,500 chemical rockets filled with the deadly nerve agent sarin, or their remnants, were stored along with other chemical warfare agents.

Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, said in a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that “armed terrorist groups” entered the Muthanna site on June 11, detained officers and soldiers from the protection force guarding the facility and seized their weapons. The following morning, the project manager spotted the looting of some equipment through the camera surveillance system before the “terrorists” disabled it, he said.

Alhakim singled out the capture of Bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad.

The UN, however, stressed that the bunkers were bombed during the first Gulf War in February 1991, which routed Iraq from Kuwait, and said the rockets were “partially destroyed or damaged.”

The UN added that the sarin munitions were “of poor quality” and “would largely be degraded after years of storage under the conditions existing there.” It said the tabun-filled containers were all treated with a decontamination solution and likely no longer contain any agent, but “the residue of this decontamination would contain cyanides, which would still be a hazard.”

According to the report, Bunker 41 contained 2,000 empty 155-mm artillery shells contaminated with the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, 605 one-ton mustard containers with residues, and heavily contaminated construction material. It said the shells could contain mustard residues, which can’t be used for chemical warfare but “remain highly toxic.”

The Syrian Kurdish enclave of Kobani has been the scene of heavy fighting since late last month, with the better-armed Islamic State fighters determined to capture the border post.

The extremist group has carved out a vast swath of territory from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule. The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorized religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers.

A US-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against militant targets in and around Kobani for more than two weeks, and the town’s fate has emerged as a major test of whether the air campaign can obstruct the advance of the extremists in Syria.

560187970389819392,false,Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed http://t.co/x6GXK8L6XX @BreitbartNews #a4a http://t.co/GzlLVMaX4T,http://bit.ly/1wzxEcP,True,Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims ‘It’s Voluntary’,"An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”

Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”

El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.

In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.

He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system. “The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal,” El-badawi stated. “The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her.” He called it “two paths to the same result.” The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation. It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the “dower” that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid. Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq (divorce).

El-badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support, visitation, and custody. He said that in most cases, custody of children is awarded to the mother.

Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.

The website for the Islamic Tribunal states, “The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers. Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment.”

It goes on to state, “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”

In explaining Sharia law, the website states, “Stoning adulterers, cutting of the hands, polyandry and the like (all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice), are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law. In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari’ah. It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding, that is Criminal Law, to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms.”

The website lists four “judges:” Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr. El-badawi. It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes, divorce (Talaq) cases, community problems, serious family problems, and Khula.

El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.

As a result, opinion polls in Russia routinely show the public sees ""no alternative"" to Putin's leadership.

So what would happen in Russia if Putin suddenly and without warning left the political stage? Over the last few days, we have seen the anxiety that even the rumor of such an event can produce in Russia and around the world. If Putin is the guarantor of stability in Russia, then does a scenario without Putin automatically imply instability -- even violent instability?

The Constitutional Scenario

Formally, of course, Russia has a constitution and a process for handling a president's incapacity. Article 92 of the Russian Constitution states that if the president is unable to fulfill the duties of the office -- although the process for declaring him incapacitated is unclear -- the prime minister would become acting president and a new presidential election would be held within three months.

The acting president would not have the power to disband the Duma, schedule a referendum, or alter the constitution.

Under Russian election law, each party represented in the State Duma -- United Russia, the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, and A Just Russia -- would have the right to nominate a candidate. Other parties would have to scramble to assemble the required 100,000 signatures and get them approved by the Central Election Commission in such a tight time frame.

So if Putin unexpectedly left the scene and the constitution were followed to the letter, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would return to the Kremlin and a competitive election would take place in three months.

The Consensus Scenario

Of course, such a smooth and legal transition of power is unlikely in Russia.

In Soviet times, political heavyweights wrestled behind the scenes until a successor emerged through some unfathomable communist alchemy.

More recently, when President Boris Yeltsin decided to retire, political insiders reached a consensus and produced the unimaginable candidacy of Vladimir Putin as his successor. They then used a combination of their financial, administrative, and media resources to get him elected.

Yeltsin's inner circle, despite its divisions, had the benefit of time in making its decision. In addition, they also had the experience of reaching a similar crucial consensus during the period around the 1996 presidential election, when the major oligarchs agreed to work together to reelect the ailing and increasingly unpopular Yeltsin.

The Conflict Scenario

But what if consensus can't be reached?

Under Putin, the political system has become more personalized and centered around the president himself, who has balanced conflicting parties. And he has almost certainly stifled all discussion of what could or should happen in a post-Putin era.

But the divisions in Putin's inner circle, always latent, have become more manifest with the Ukraine crisis and have intensified since the February 27 assassination of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov.

""Now the conflict between the clans has become very seriously intense,"" says journalist and analyst Raf Shakirov. ""It is obvious that different groups are pushing for different paths.""

The main fault line, he says, is between ""hawks"" who have become ascendant due to the Ukraine crisis and Russia's showdown with the West and a ""liberal group"" responsible for the economy who would prefer a thaw at home and a rapprochement abroad.

The former group, Shakirov says, will probably fight fiercely in any transition to preserve their primacy. ""This group understands that for them any normalization would mean, not the end of the world, but a loss of position,"" Shakirov says. ""They cannot risk the loss of the almost unlimited power that they have now.""

Likewise, political analyst Marat Guelman sees conflict as the likely scenario. These are ""people who have tasted lawlessness, who already feel that they have the right to break the law, to kill,"" he says in reference to the Kremlin hard-liners.

But the story's juicy premise unraveled almost as quickly.

Jessica Pressler wrote the profile of Mohammed Islam, a senior at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, for a feature called ""Reasons to Love New York.""

After getting an advanced look at Pressler's piece, the New York Post put the improbable story on its Sunday front page. By Monday morning, Islam's story was one of the hottest on Facebook.

Then it fell apart. In an interview with the New York Observer published Monday night, Islam admitted that he fabricated the whole story and has never actually made a return on any investment. ""So it's total fiction?"" asked the Observer. ""Yes,"" Islam said. (updated)

Early Monday, CNBC's Josh Brown wondered if Islam was duping ""an overly eager press willing to believe.""

Pressler, who will be joining a financial investigative unit at Bloomberg News early next year, takes exception to Brown's characterization.

""I still think the piece is skeptical enough,"" she told CNNMoney early Monday afternoon. ""The story says, 'This is a rumor and draw your own conclusions.'""

In the New York Magazine story, Pressler wrote that the amount of money is ""unbelievable,"" though she also said ""as rumors go, this one seemed legit."" Later, Pressler wrote that Islam ""confirmed his net worth is in the 'high eight figures.'""

She said Islam provided a bank statement to a New York magazine fact-checker, and that the teen does have ""an obscene amount of money in his account.""

""I think that kid is the real deal,"" she said.

Pressler said the problem stemmed from the story's original headline: ""A Stuyvesant senior made $72 million trading stocks on his lunch break.""

Pressler said she didn't write it. ""I feel like the headline was pretty glib - I feel comfortable about what's in the actual piece.""

It has since been changed online to: ""Because a Stuyvesant Senior Made Millions Picking Stocks. His Hedge Fund Opens as Soon As He Turns 18.""

The idea that anybody, much less a teenager, could make $72 million trading was questionable.

Business Insider did its own reporting on Monday, eventually learning from an unnamed ""source familiar with the story"" that the figure was off the mark. Islam's high school Investment Club told Business Insider it performed ""due dilligence"" and discovered that ""these claims are false"" and had been hyped by ""the media in the interests of sensationalism.""

Islam then splashed cold water on the figure himself, telling CNBC on Monday that he doesn't even know who started the rumor. He also took issue with Pressler's write-up. ""The way we were portrayed is not who we are,"" CNBC quoted him as saying.

In a statement to CNBC, New York Magazine defended Pressler's reporting, noting the headline change and the fact that the ""story itself does not specify an amount.""

It isn't hard to see why the story initially got so much attention. Pressler followed Islam and a pair of his friends around as they dined on caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice. There's a casual reference to a ""hedge-fund guy"" who wants to give the three youngsters $150 million to invest.

They spoke in reverential terms about the Koch brothers and the ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" with Islam in the role of Jordan Belfort.

But Pressler seemed perplexed by all the scrutiny.

""Holding it to the standard of a financial publication? It's just a different thing,"" she said. ""That's not to say it isn't important if he lied.""

""If he lied, then he lied,"" she added. ""But I just want to be clear that we didn't 100% follow this lie. That's just not what happened.""

The story, in her mind, was still worth doing.

""The story is the reason to love New York,"" she said. ""And I came to love the fact that these kids are running around the city with these big dreams. It can only happen in New York, these kids eating caviar, talking about how they're going to be the new Koch bothers. It seems like a uniquely New York milieu.""

Exchanges of fire are continuing at a hotel in Burkina Faso's capital as special forces seek to break a deadly siege by suspected Islamist gunmen.

Some 30 hostages were freed overnight at Ouagadougou's luxury Splendid Hotel but there are fears that at least 20 people were killed.

Gunmen stormed the hotel and a nearby cafe after setting off bombs.

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has said it carried out the attack in the West African nation, monitors said.

French President Francois Hollande - whose forces are part of the operation against the militants - condemned the ""odious and cowardly attack"".

Remi Dandjinou, the Burkinabe communications minister, told the BBC there were between six and seven gunmen and they had been staying at the hotel.

He also said a member of the government, Minister of Public Works Clement Sawadogo, was among those freed at the hotel.

Thirty-three people were in hospital receiving treatment, he added.

French special forces and Burkinabe troops have been deployed at the hotel, which is used by UN staff and Westerners.

Hospital chief Robert Sangare quoted survivors as saying at least 20 people had died in the initial attack, before the security forces began their assault on the hotel.

Interior Minister Simon Compaore said 10 bodies had been found on the terrace of the nearby Cappuccino cafe.

The al-Murabitoun group, which reportedly merged with AQIM recently, was involved in the attack, monitors said.

Who are al-Murabitoun?

Witnesses said the gunmen had initially entered the Cappuccino cafe. One employee at the cafe told AFP news agency ""several people"" had been killed there.

Eyewitnesses reported hearing exchanges of gunfire between the men and security forces, as well as sporadic gunfire from inside the hotel, which is close to the country's international airport.

Who is the group responsible?

Image copyright AP Image caption Twenty people died in an attack by al-Murabitoun and al-Qaeda on a Mali hotel in November

The SITE monitoring group, which analyses jihadist networks, reports that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has said it was behind the attack.

The monitoring group specifically stated that those responsible were the al-Murabitoun group, which is based in the Sahara desert in northern Mali and contains fighters loyal to the veteran Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar.

Last month, the group announced it had merged with AQIM. Belmokhtar, a one-eyed commander who fought Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s, was once a member of AQIM but left after a falling-out with its leadership.

Belmokhtar has been declared dead many times, the latest by a US air strike on 14 June last year in Libya - according to Libyan authorities - but his death has not been formally confirmed.

AQIM and al-Murabitoun said they were behind an attack on a hotel in Burkina Faso's neighbour Mali in November, that left 20 people dead.

Burkina Faso had recently held its first presidential election since a coup earlier last year.

That coup toppled long-time leader Blaise Compaore, who had governed for 27 years.

""We are still in a context of political fragility, so I think the timing of this attack is meaningful,"" Cynthia Ohayon, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told the BBC from Ouagadougou.

""The country has long borders with Mali and Niger, and we know there are armed groups present on the border, so this was probably something we had coming.""

In November, an AQIM attack on a hotel in the Malian capital Bamako left 19 people dead.

During an address to the nation, Prime Minster Stephen Harper said the incident in Ottawa was a 'terrorist' act. Mr. Harper also indicated that it remains unclear whether the man shot dead on Parliament Hill Wednesday acted alone.

""Together we will remain vigilant against those at home or abroad who wish to harm us.""

The Prime Minister concluded by stating that there will be no safe haven for terrorists and expressed confidence that Canadians will pull together in the wake of this week’s events.

Federal sources have identified the suspected shooter as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a man in his early 30s who was known to Canadian authorities.

Sources told The Globe and Mail he was recently unable to secure travel documentation he was seeking, thus blocking his attempt to travel abroad. The circumstances are similar to that surrounding the case of Martin Rouleau-Couture, the Quebecker who was shot Monday after running down two Canadian Forces soldiers with his car.

Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau was born in 1982 and was the son of Bulgasem Zehaf, a Quebec businessman who appears to have fought in 2011 in Libya, and Susan Bibeau, the deputy chairperson of a division of Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board.

Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau has a record in Quebec in the early 2000s for petty crimes such as possession of drugs, credit-card forgery and robbery. He was also charged with robbery in 2011 in Vancouver.

The soldier who was killed was identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, according to his aunt. Cpl. Cirillo, who was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a regiment of Reserve Forces based in Hamilton, was training to join the Canada Border Services Agency, his aunt told The Globe and Mail.

“We’re still in the process of an active operation right now. We’re treating this very seriously with the RCMP in identifying and clearing Parliament Hill to render it safe,” Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau told a mid-afternoon media briefing.

Shortly after 8:30 p.m. (ET) Ottawa police lifted the lockdown in the city's downtown core saying that the threat to public safety no longer remained.

However, the police operation on Parliament Hill is still ongoing and remains off limits to the public.

Asked if the attack had caught police off guard, Gilles Michaud, commanding officer of the RCMP’s national division, said: “I think that from our reaction, it caught us by surprise.”

Still, he said “all available and necessary resources were activated and deployed immediately” and will remain in place as long as necessary.

Canadian Armed Forces personnel, at least in the Ottawa area, are being instructed not to wear their uniform in public unless on duty, a source said.

A Forces directive to this effect will go out shortly, the source said.

THE SHOOTING: FEDERAL BUILDINGS PUT INTO LOCKDOWN

Gunfire erupted at the National War Memorial around 9:52 a.m. (ET), then moved to Parliament Hill’s Centre Block. The Parliament Hill shooting was captured on this video by a Globe reporter. One Parliament Hill guard was shot in the leg, treated in hospital and was later released.

The outbreak of violence sent MPs into hiding and all federal government buildings into lockdown, which wasn't lifted until late on Wednesday evening.

Mr. Harper was with Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino in a caucus meeting when the gunfire began, Mr. Fantino told the Toronto Sun Wednesday. Fantino credits a sergeant-at-arms for taking down a gunman. ""All the details are not in but the sergeant-at-arms, a former Mountie, is the one that engaged the gunman, or one of them at least, and stopped this,"" Fantino said.

A Hewlett-Packard logo is seen at the company's Executive Briefing Center in Palo Alto, California January 16, 2013. REUTERS/Stephen Lam

The move, which could be announced as early as Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology’s most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.

Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.

A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.

HP’s printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter’s financial results. It is not clear how many of HP’s more than 300,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.

Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.

HP’s market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by Apple Inc’s $596 billion and Microsoft Corp’s $380 billion.

It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world’s No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP’s closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.

SPIN-OFF TREND

HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.

A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.

Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.

Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.

The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.

“I wonder what would have changed in the board’s thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now,” said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.

“PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further.”

The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.

Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.",4163

He allegedly was behind 2013's deadly siege of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall

U.S. military attack killed him this week, Pentagon says

His death is ""a major symbolic and operational loss to Al-Shabaab,"" official says

Ahmed Godane, the leader of the Somali militant group Al-Shabaab, was killed this week in a U.S. military operation, the Pentagon said Friday.

""The U.S. military undertook operations against Godane on Sept. 1, which led to his death. Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to Al-Shabaab,"" said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

On Monday, U.S. military conducted a strike in the African country targeting Godane, who had pledged allegiance to al Qaeda. He headed Al-Shabaab as it terrorized East Africa, killing Somali officials, aid workers and others in a spate of suicide bombings. Godane allegedly was behind 2013's deadly siege of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall.

Before this week's strike, the U.S. military was tipped off to what Kirby called ""actionable intelligence ... strong enough"" to suggest Godane's whereabouts.

In response, U.S. commandos flew -- aided by drones -- into an area south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, around 6:20 p.m. (11:20 a.m. ET) Monday.

Abdikadir Mohamed Nur Sidii, governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, characterized the attack near the port city of Barawe as so ferocious ""it jolted the entire region.""

JUST WATCHED A look inside Al-Shabaab Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A look inside Al-Shabaab 03:38

Sidii said, ""I never heard such a huge and deafening blast as the result of the airstrike.""

Earlier this week, Kirby didn't elaborate on how much firepower was involved, beyond the use of Hellfire and laser-guided missiles. Somali intelligence officials counted at least four such missiles.

After the attack, an Al-Shababb Twitter account said one person was killed but asserted it wasn't Godane. ""'Ahmed Abdi Godane' is alive and doing fine,"" the tweet said, calling itself an ""official mujahedin account"" in the Islamic land of Somalia.

At the time, CNN was unable to verify the authenticity of that claim on Twitter.

The man behind Al-Shabaab

Godane, who was also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, became the leader of Al-Shabaab in 2008.

Traditionally, Al-Shabaab focused on bringing Islamic rule to Somalia, attracting dozens of ethnic Somalis -- and a few Westerners -- from the United States and Europe.

But last year Godane seemed to be refocusing the group on terrorist attacks beyond Somalia -- against East African states supporting the Somali government, especially Uganda and Kenya, and against Western interests in East Africa.

The September 2013 Westgate Mall attack in Kenya's capital was Al-Shabaab's most audacious, but the massacre that left 67 people dead wasn't the group's first strike outside Somalia. In 2010, Al-Shabaab carried out suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in which more than 70 people were killed.

Still, the Westgate siege demonstrated Godane's desire to align his group more closely with al Qaeda. In a taped message afterward, he noted the attack took place ""just 10 days after the anniversary date of the blessed 9/11 operations.""

Under Godane, Al-Shabaab became a formal ally of al Qaeda. The move led to dissent in the group, which Godane dealt with ruthlessly, using his control of Al-Shabaab's intelligence wing. The American jihadist Omar Hammami was reportedly killed in September 2013 after criticizing Godane's leadership and his treatment of foreign fighters.

Godane was said to be 37 years old, and was originally from Somaliland in northern Somalia. He was slim to the point of wispy, as seen in the few photographs of him, and preferred recording audio messages to appearing in public.

A former Somali prime minister, Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, once described Godane as the cleverest of Al-Shabaab's leaders.",4136

Social and Centralized WordPress, Drupal, and the custom CMS solutions of the world are all independent, non-connected instances that each need to be updated individually. There are over 87 million instances of WordPress alone in the world, and each security upgrade, feature update, and every other single thing has to be updated for each site individually. By contrast, RebelMouse is a social, centralized platform built to keep up with the speed of the tech giants. Our updates are pushed out to all of our sites at once (and sometimes even multiple times a day) with content creation tools integrated directly into social APIs. We can get clients off of clunky CMSs and into the future in a matter of days. Many of our clients have seen page views and unique visitors grow anywhere from 50–300% literally within the first days of launch. We iterate with the times and tell you what's changing in the world, how we've reacted to it, and how it's built into the updates you get from the platform. Our creative agency team trains your teams or takes on special projects.

Easy Migrations — the Re-Platform Remastered We create growth with every re-platform. And it doesn't take months, it takes hours or days.

A Better Experience for Readers — Social UX for Media Everybody is building media sites wrong. We make it look simple. All the hard technology is at work behind the scenes. For readers, your content shines, is shareable, and your website becomes a rabbit hole that pulls users into more content that creates more sharing.

Better Social Distribution Tools — Cross-Platform Reach It isn't just about publishing. There's a new content life cycle on the internet that leads to fast organic growth at dramatically lower cost. The key is understanding how to use social to your advantage instead of being lost in the noise. RebelMouse is a contagious media company, and the software turns organic growth into an efficient, repeatable, and scalable process.

Better Authoring Tools Your writers, editors, creators, and community deserve tools that make them fast and efficient. It's also important that they follow a process that leads to best practices, so that the CMS itself is training your team with every post as they onboard. Grabbing social content, building listicles and slideshows — RebelMouse makes everything simple, clean, and easy for writers.

Analytics and Management Tools But it's also important for you to manage your writers, see their performance, enable them to learn from each other, and help them become data driven. RebelMouse analytics provide you with a clear view of who is performing, what posts are working, and where that content is gaining traction. We also have deep Google Analytics integration, so you can easily add in components, promos, third-party units, and ad units.

Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on his Facebook page that the plane was hit by a Russian surface-to-air missile known as a Buk. The type of missile can hit a target far higher than Flight 17 was flying.

The Associated Press reported earlier this week that it had seen a Buk system on the ground in a separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine.

The separatists denied responsibility. The separatists were quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax as saying that they had found the “black box” flight recorder. Other Russian reports said the rebels planned to call a three-day cease-fire to allow for an investigation.

In the chaotic early hours after the plane went down, the separatists and the Ukrainian government each said the other had shot it down.

A Ukrainian interior ministry official said that pro-Russian separatists had downed the plane, and a leader of the separatists, Aleksander Borodai, said that it was the Ukrainian air force.

Ukraine’s recently elected president, Petro Poroshenko, called it an act of terrorism. He said he had spoken to the Dutch prime minister and invited the Netherlands to join the investigation.

On national television, he said, “I would like to draw your attention that we do not call it an incident, not a disaster, but we call it a terrorist act.”

In a video statement, Poroshenko claimed the government had intercepted conversations — one of them allegedly with a Russian colonel whom he identified as Vasiliy Geranin — in which rebel commanders and fighters were ""boasting about the hit airplane."" NBC News couldn't authenticate the recordings, which the Ukrainian government posted online.

At a government meeting in Moscow late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to pin the blame on Ukraine, saying ""the state over whose territory this happened bears the responsibility for the terrible tragedy.""

""This tragedy would not have happened had there been peace in this land, if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine,"" Putin was quoted as saying by Interfax.

Images appearing to depict the crash site spread quickly on social media. NBC News could not confirm the images.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said his government was investigating. The defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that there was no confirmation that the plane had been shot down. He said on Twitter that the Malaysian military had been instructed to “get on it.”

Obama spoke on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Putin noted the reports of a downed passenger jet. Officials at the Pentagon scrambled to learn more and assess who might have had the capability to shoot down an airliner.

The conflict in Ukraine has raised tensions between Russia and the West to their highest since the end of the Cold War.

In February, protesters toppled the pro-Russian government in Kiev, and Russia answered by invading and later annexing the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine. Since then, pro-Russian separatists have fought Ukrainian security forces in the east.

Evan Kohlmann, an NBC News terrorism analyst, said that shooting down a 777 at 33,000 feet would require “access to serious military equipment.”

“The chances this was done by a conventional terrorist group like al Qaeda or something like that is almost nonexistent,” he said.

The immediate impact on relations between Russia and the West was not clear. At the request of Ukraine, Britain asked for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, a U.N. diplomat told NBC News.

Data from the website FlightAware showed that Flight 17 took off from Amsterdam at about 6:30 a.m. ET. Its last recorded position was over Ukraine, west of the Russian border, at 9:19 a.m. ET.",4098

The US Justice Department will phase out use of privately owned prisons, citing safety concerns.

Contracts with 13 private prisons will be reviewed and allowed to expire over the next five years.

""They do not save substantially on costs and ... they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said explaining the decision.

The majority of US prisoners are held in state-run prisons.

On Wall Street, the stocks of private prison companies declined sharply after the news was announced.

By Thursday afternoon, Corrections Corporation of America stock had plunged by nearly 50%.

An Inspector General's report released this month found that private prisons saw higher rates of violent incidents and rule infractions in comparison with government-run institutions.

Jonathan Burns, a spokesman for the Corrections Corporation of America, told BBC News that the report contained ""significant flaws"" and that other studies have shown their facilities ""to be equal or better with regard to safety and quality"".

David Fathi, who directs the National Prison Project for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) told BBC News that the decision could have a trickle-down effect on state and local prisons, where more than 90% of US prisoners are held.

In prison systems ""nobody ever wants to be the first"" to make changes to policy, Mr Fathi says, so the states will be watching closely to see if the change in federal policy successfully cuts back on violence - and costs.

There were 94,365 prisoners being held in private facilities overseen by states in 2010, according to the Sentencing Project group.

During the Democratic presidential primary race, Hillary Clinton's main rival Senator Bernie Sanders made a campaign promise to end the ""private, for-profit prison racket"".

Senator Sanders sponsored a bill during his campaign attempting to end the use of private prisons in September 2015 saying ""we cannot fix our criminal justice system if corporations are allowed to profit from mass incarceration"".

In a statement after the decision, Senator Sanders called the move ""an important step in the right direction"", and that it is ""an international embarrassment that we put more people behind bars than any other country on Earth... due in large part to private prisons"".

Mrs Clinton's website states that she will ""end the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons"".

Mother Jones magazine published an expose earlier this month after one of their reporters took a job as a guard at a private prison in Louisiana for four months.

The magazine found the wide scale use of violence by prisoners and guards alike.

The federal government began to rely on private prisons in the 1990's during a period of overcrowding, with the inmate population peaking in 2013.

The decline in prisoner population over the past three years contributed to the Justice Department's decision, Ms Yates said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Democratic candidates have drawn attention to private prisons during the presidential election

President Barack Obama had made criminal justice reform a priority for his administration, and in July 2015 he became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison.

The Obama administration has pushed for shorter sentences for non-violent crimes, while separately Mr Obama has regularly reduced the prison sentences of large groups of non-violent inmates.

""Mass incarceration makes our entire country worse off, and we need to do something about it,"" Mr Obama said last year.

Earlier this month, Mr Obama commuted the sentences of 214 federal inmates, meaning he has now authorised more prisoner releases than the last nine previous presidents combined, accounting to analysts.

As of December, private prisons housed 22,660 federal inmates, out of a total of nearly 200,000.",4069

LOS ANGELES (AP) — When it came to portraying the rugged western outdoorsman who helped transform a pack of filtered cigarettes into the world's most popular brand, Marlboro Man Eric Lawson was the real deal.

Ruggedly handsome, the actor could ride a horse through the wide-open spaces of the Southwest, from Texas to Colorado to Arizona or wherever else the Phillip Morris tobacco company sent him to light up while representing a true American icon, the cowboy. And he really did smoke Marlboro cigarettes, as many as three packs a day.

Lawson was still smoking in 2006 when he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He died of the disease at his home in San Luis Obispo on Jan. 10. He was 72.

For three years in the late 1970s and early '80s, Lawson portrayed one of the most iconic figures in both advertising and popular culture.

And for the past several years, Lawson had spoken out fiercely about the hazards of smoking, doing a public service announcement for the American Cancer Society in the 1990s, years before he was able to bring himself to quit.

""He tried to speak to the kids, telling them don't start smoking,"" his wife, Susan Lawson, told The Associated Press. ""He already knew cigarettes had a hold on him.""

Exactly how many rugged he-man types portrayed the Marlboro Man over the years isn't clear, although Lawson was one of dozens.

His wife said Monday he was friendly with some of the others, including Wayne McLaren, a former rodeo rider who died in 1992 of lung cancer that he blamed on his lifelong smoking habit.

Like Lawson, McLaren spent his final years advocating against smoking. So did David McLean, who died in 1995 of lung cancer that he also blamed on smoking. He was 73.

As the Marlboro Man, Lawson and the others helped turn a brand that had once been marketed as a mild women's cigarette into the ultimate symbol of American machismo.

Not every Marlboro Man was a cowboy — there were also pilots, hunters, weight lifters, miners and other macho characters. But cowboys were clearly the most popular and the most often used.

""The most powerful — and in some quarters, most hated — brand image of the century, the Marlboro Man stands worldwide as the ultimate American cowboy and masculine trademark, helping establish Marlboro as the best-selling cigarette in the world,"" the industry publication Advertising Age declared in 1999.

Part of the reason for the brand's success was that Phillip Morris' ad agency went to great pains to track down real cowboys, who not only looked rugged but could really do things like rope and ride.

""He had to go out and ride, he needed to prove himself as a cowboy,"" Lawson's wife recalled of her husband's audition to become a Marlboro Man.

By the time he got the job in 1978, cigarette advertising was no longer allowed on U.S. television, so Lawson appeared in print and billboard ads. His wife still has one from Time magazine.

The ads, often filmed in stunning, picturesque settings in the West always emphasized that it was a real man, not in any way a wimp, who smoked a Marlboro.

Lawson was perfect for the part. The veteran actor had appeared in such Western films and TV shows as ""The Shooter,"" ''Walker, Texas Ranger,"" ''Tall Tale,"" ''Bonanza: Under Attack"" and ""The A Team.""

Later, he also became a perfect role model who made a difference in the lives of the people he kept from smoking simply by pointing out what it did to him, said John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society.

""That's important,"" Seffrin said, ""because people stop and think if that happens to Eric Lawson it could happen to me.""

In addition to his wife, Lawson is survived by six children, 18 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

https://t.co/Kam2Wp4BJY",http://go.wh.gov/EqualPay,True,This Is Why Today is Equal Pay Day:,"When all people know their country is invested in their success, we are all better off. Together, we must rid our society of the injustice that is pay discrimination and restore the promise that is the right of every American: the idea that with hard work, anyone can reach for their dreams and know no limits but the scope of their aspirations. President Obama

Today -- April 12 -- is Equal Pay Day. What does that mean exactly?

In the U.S., the typical woman who is working full-time still earns just $0.79 for every 41 a man earns. That gender pay gap is even larger for women of color, and can result in the loss of hundred of thousands of dollars over a woman's lifetime.

In short, this is less a day to celebrate and more a day to recognize that work remains to make equality a reality for millions of women across the country.

Since taking office, President Obama has made equal pay a top priority. Here's a few of the steps he's taken to make progress on that goal:

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed on January 29, 2009, is the very first piece of legislation that President Obama signed into law. The law, named after a woman who discovered her employer was paying less than men doing the same job, makes it easier for women to effectively challenge unequal pay. The law amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that unfair pay complaints can be filed within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck -- and that 180 days resets after each paycheck.

The National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force

In his first official State of the Union Address, President Obama pledged to crack down on violations of equal pay laws. So he created the National Equal Pay Task Force that year to bring together the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management to help understand the full scope of the wage gap, to enforce laws already prohibiting pay discrimination, and ensure the employees and employers are educated on their rights and obligations with respect to wage discrimination.

You can read the Task Force's full report here.

An Equal Pay Executive Order

In 2014, President Obama used his own executive authority to prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees who discuss or inquire about their compensation. It provides a critical tool encourage pay transparency, so workers have a potential way of discovering violations of equal pay laws and are able to seek the appropriate remedies.

Building the Data on Equal Pay

The Obama administration is working to annually collect summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from businesses with 100 or more employees. This step will cover 63 million employees and help focus public enforcement of our equal pay laws and provide better insight into discriminatory pay practices across industries and professions.

The Paycheck Fairness Act

The President has taken a number of steps within his power to help narrow the wage gap between men and women in this country -- but he cannot accomplish this alone. That's why he's calling on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act -- commonsense legislation that updates the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to give women additional tools to fight pay discrimination.

When President John F. Kennedy signed the original Equal Pay Act into law, women were paid 59 cents for every dollar paid to men. After more than 50 years, that gap has narrowed to 79 cents. We need to close this gap for good. As President Obama said in a State of the Union Address,

It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode. This year, let’s all come together – Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall to Main Street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves. Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds.

(Photo: Bill Haber, AP)

Donna Douglas, who played hillbilly bombshell Elly May Clampett on the baby-boomer-beloved 1960s sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, has died. She was 82.

Charlene Smith, her niece-in-law, confirmed Friday to USA TODAY that she died of pancreatic cancer on New Year's Day at Baton Rouge General Hospital, near her home in Zachary, La.

The Baton Rouge paper, The Advocate and other media outlets, including local TV station WAFB, also confirmed her death, although most put her age at 81.

""She was 82,"" Smith said firmly, adding jokingly, ""She's going to haunt me for that.""

Douglas' death leaves only one member of the show's original cast still alive: Max Baer Jr., who played Elly May's cousin, Jethro. He is 77.

""She was Elly May until the day she died,"" Baer told the website RumorFix. ""When I saw her for autograph signings or other gatherings, she always dressed the same with pink or blue"" and of course those signature pigtails.""

He said he last saw Douglas in January 2013 for an autograph signing in Los Angeles. He said she had pancreatic cancer for the last months of her life.

""But she was a very private person — nothing like me."" A friend told him Donna had a message for him: ""Tell Maxie I thought I was going to get better.""

Smith described Douglas as a ""very good Christian lady. We all loved her,"" she said. ""Whenever she gave presents, they always came with (passages) from Scripture.""

Douglas, a former Miss Baton Rouge and Miss New Orleans, was born in Pride, La., and returned to live in Zachary, after her time in Hollywood, to be near her only child, son Danny Bourgeois. She is survived by him, by three grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, one brother and other extended family members, Smith said.

She was married and divorced twice, including the second time, to The Beverly Hillbillies director, Robert Leeds.

Smith said the family plans a private funeral.

Douglas grew up in Pride and attended a local Catholic high school, where she played softball and basketball, and was a member of the school's first graduating class.

But she'll always be known as Elly May — the tomboy-but-sweetly sexy blond Clampett daughter who never seemed to be aware of her effect on men, and who referred to their Beverly Hills mansion swimming pool as the ""SEE-ment pond.""

In many ways, she was Elly May, with her own real-life rags-to-riches story.

""Oh, yeah, it was just like a slice out of my life,"" she told The Advocate in an interview a few years ago."" I knew everything about Elly.""

And she didn't mind the association, either. ""So many kinds of people relate to Elly May,"" Douglas said, according to the Associated Press. ""So many people love her, and that means a lot to me.""

Douglas also will be remembered as co-starring opposite Elvis Presley in the 1966 film Frankie and Johnny, and for an especially creepy Twilight Zone episode, ""The Eye of the Beholder.""

The Beverly Hillbillies was a classic fish-out-of water comedy about a poor backwoods Ozark family transplanted to California after striking oil (""black gold"" as the banjo-inflected theme song went) on their land.

Starring Buddy Ebsen as Jed Clampett (he died in 2003) and Irene Ryan (she died in 1973) as Granny, the show ran for nine years on CBS, from 1962 to 1971. It consistently ranked in the top most-watched programs on TV during its run, even though critics didn't care for it.

After Hillbillies ended, Douglas worked in real estate, recorded country and gospel music albums and wrote a book for children that drew on biblical themes.

In 2010 she sued CBS and toymaker Mattel seeking some of the proceeds from sales of a Barbie doll that used Elly May's name and likeness. The suit was settled in 2011.

To this day, many boomers can sing the theme song by heart. But even some non-boomers expressed appreciation on Twitter at the news of Douglas' death.

Simpson has CTE: https://t.co/gV2LkGKogI https://t.co/xpFRr3wLyQ",http://es.pn/1m4Li9N,True,Dr. Bennet Omalu 'would bet my medical license' that O.J. Simpson has CTE,"Ryan Clark reacts to Dr. Bennet Omalu publically saying that he believes O.J. Simpson suffers from CTE, thus explaining his erratic behavior since his career ended. (2:27)

Dr. Bennet Omalu, the renowned neuropathologist whose discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in football players inspired the movie ""Concussion,"" is willing to ""bet [his] medical license"" that O.J. Simpson is suffering from the disease.

""O.J. Simpson is more likely than not to suffer from CTE,"" Omalu told ABC News earlier this week. ""I would bet my medical license on it.""

Editor's Picks NFL data: Diagnosed concussions way up in '15 The NFL says reported concussions rose 32 percent in regular-season games to the highest number in any of the past four years.

CTE is believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head. It has been found mostly in athletes who play contact sports, such as football. Multiple NFL players -- including Frank Gifford and Junior Seau -- have been diagnosed with CTE after their deaths.

Omalu has not examined Simpson personally, and CTE can only be diagnosed after death via an examination of brain tissue, but he told ABC News that he can identify the tell-tale signs of CTE's behavioral symptoms, which he said include explosive, impulsive behavior, impaired judgment, criminality and even mood disorders.

The strongest evidence that Simpson may have CTE, Omalu said, is that ""he was exposed to thousands of blunt force trauma of his brain"" during his playing career.

Simpson, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985, played in the NFL for 11 seasons with the Buffalo Bills, where he won the 1973 NFL MVP after becoming the first running back to gain 2,000 yards in a season, and the San Francisco 49ers. He also won the Heisman Trophy at USC.

Dr. Bennet Omalu says O.J. Simpson ""was exposed to thousands of blunt force trauma of his brain"" during his NFL and college playing career and ""is more likely than not to suffer from CTE."" Ethan Miller/Getty Images

One of the most famous running backs in football history, Simpson became infamous after he was charged with the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.

Though he was found not guilty in the much-disputed 1995 criminal case, Simpson lost a wrongful death civil suit brought against him by the families of Goldman and his ex-wife, and he was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.

In September 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas for armed robbery after attempting to steal sports memorabilia that he said belonged to him. The following year -- 13 years to the day after being acquitted in his criminal trial -- he was found guilty of robbery and kidnapping and sentenced to up to 33 years in prison.

Simpson himself once used concussions as part of a legal strategy after his conviction in the armed robbery case, but he was denied a new trial.

While Omalu stressed that CTE does not cause the criminal behavior that led to Simpson's incarceration, he wants the case to serve a reminder of the life-altering damage that can result from playing football.

""I think because of our intoxication with football, we are in some type of delusional denial,"" Omalu said. ""But that is how serious this is.""

Norman Pardo, Simpson's former business manager who has visited Simpson in prison, concurs.

""Everybody who knows him knows there's a problem there,"" Pardo told People magazine earlier this week. ""There's something wrong with his head and there has been for a long time.""

Another indicator for Omalu is the size of Simpson's head. Dave Hojnowski, who was a longtime Bills equipment manager, told NFL.com in 2011 that Simpson had ""a big huge head"" and had to wear a custom-sized 8¼ helmet as manufacturers during that time didn't make anything over 7¾.

""If you have a bigger head that means your head is heavier,"" Omalu told People. ""That means the momentum of your impact would be bigger. It's basic physics.""

Ali Daqneesh, the 10-year-old brother of Omran Daqneesh , died Saturday, according to Yousef Saddiq, the director of the Aleppo Media Center.

Ali succumbed in an Aleppo field hospital from injuries sustained in the Wednesday airstrike, Saddiq said.

""He was in critical condition for the past three days and passed away this morning,"" Saddiq said. ""His mother is still receiving medical care because she is also in critical condition.""

The family remains in Aleppo, he said.

The photos and video of Omran sitting silently in an ambulance awaiting help are grim reflections of the grinding Syrian civil war.

The image spread across social media and sparked interest in the situation in Aleppo, much like the picture of a child's body on a Turkish beach raised sympathy for refugees who fled Syria.

""Omran ... is still alive, and God willing will continue his life in better conditions than the ones he is living in now,"" said a doctor who identified himself as Dr Abu Rasoul, who treated the deceased.

""His brother, whose photo was not taken, no one mentioned him, he died and he is by God's side now.""

The doctor said Ali suffered a lot of trauma.

""Omran was pulled out of the rubble quickly to come back to life, Ali stayed under the rubble for a while,"" he said.

Death toll climbs in Aleppo

Aleppo, in northern Syria, has been besieged for years during that country's civil war. Fighting has intensified in recent weeks and the death toll is climbing.

Ali's death raised to 448 the number of people killed by fighting in and around Aleppo this month alone, reported the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. That number includes 100 children.

More than 12,500 people, including more than 4,500 children, were killed over a 22-month period by Syrian and Russian air bombardment, the SOHR reported.

Bombing and years of warfare have reduced large sections of Aleppo to rubble. The International Red Cross said the city is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.

Aleppo has strategic importance as the country's largest city and a vital economic hub. When rebels first launched their attack on the city in July 2012, it sent shock waves through government-held parts of Aleppo. Regime strongholds were no longer seen as impenetrable. Now the Syrian military, aided by Russia, is bombing the city in an attempt to win it back.

Former ambassador criticizes Russia

Activists blame the Syrian regime and Russia for the bombings in Aleppo.

For instance, 50 people were killed in April when a hospital near Aleppo was bombed . Despite accusations, Russia and Syria said they didn't drop those bombs.

Reports that ties between the United States and Russia are growing stronger and could extend to collaboration on airstrikes against targets inside Syria has drawn criticism from former US Ambassador for War Crime Issues Stephen Rapp.

In an interview with CNN's Hala Gorani on Thursday, Rapp complained of ""massive violations of humanitarian law and war crimes.""

""(If) we get involved in joint operations with people that are committing war crimes,"" he said, ""I don't think it's a smart bargain. It puts us on the wrong side. We need to continue to press for accountability and to work with people that don't have blood on their hands.""

He referred to the boy in the picture, saying: ""People say we have to unite against Deash (another term for ISIS), but how can someone who did what they did to Omran be a useful individual?""",3975

Just weeks after Congress lifted a 40-year ban on exporting oil, the first shipments of the black stuff left U.S. ports for Europe.

The first freely-traded shipments of U.S. crude are symbolic of the country's newfound role as a leading producer of oil. America's entry into the world market can also be viewed with relief by those worried about potential supply disruptions. After all, many big oil producers are located in volatile parts of the world susceptible to geopolitical shocks.

""The fact that producers have free access to the global market will make it easier for U.S. supply to respond to disruptions around the world,"" said Jason Borduff, a former energy adviser to President Obama who is currently a professor at Columbia University.

America officially banned exports in 1975. It came two years after an OPEC oil embargo that banned oil sales to the U.S. had sent gas prices skyrocketing. Newspaper photographs of long lines of cars outside of gas stations became a common and worrisome image.

Fast forward 40 years and the world has changed drastically, with booming U.S. oil production from the shale revolution creating an epic supply glut that recently sent oil prices below $30 a barrel.

Some of that American oil is now finding a home overseas. On New Year's Eve ConocoPhillips (COP) and NuStar Energy (NS) announced what they said was the first exports of U.S.-produced light crude oil since the ban was lifted. The companies shipped oil pumped from the Eagle Ford Shale of Texas.

Other shipments believed to be containing oil pumped from the U.S. have left for destinations in Europe in recent weeks as well.

Related: Is Saudi Arabia finally willing to rescue the oil markets?

In the long run, the ability to send U.S. oil overseas will help the energy industry. In the short term, the depressed oil prices are actually expected to slow U.S. oil production in 2016.

And given the current backdrop, don't expect U.S. exports to skyrocket any time soon.

""Oil oversupply is currently a global issue, and not one confined to the U.S. There is little appetite or need for our oil to flow anywhere else,"" said Anthony Starkey, manager of energy analysis at Platts Bentek.

There's also fierce competition on the global stage, with Russia, Saudi Arabia and producers in North Africa like Nigeria engaging in a battle to maintain market share.

Related: This oil-producing country may need a bailout

Just a year ago American oil would have been a hot seller on the global stage. It was trading about $12 a barrel cheaper than Brent crude, the global standard. That means European buyers would have been willing to front the heavy costs involved with shipping oil across the Atlantic.

But that's changed. U.S. oil prices are now just $1 or $2 a barrel cheaper than Brent.

""The economics don't entirely work for U.S. crude to be traded everywhere in the world,"" said Brian Scheid, a senior editor at Platts.

There are also logistical hurdles keeping U.S. oil from straying too far from home. Due to the longstanding export ban, America's Gulf Coast doesn't currently have the equipment in place needed to load the giant supertankers that other countries typically use to ship oil long distances, according to Nilofar Saidi, a crude oil market analyst at ClipperData. Smaller ships can be used on voyages to Latin America and Europe, but aren't ideal for far-flung places like East Asia.

Columbia's Bordoff thinks it will take time to fix that situation. ""Given the market situation today, there's going to be caution about large-scale infrastructure investments,"" he said.

However, U.S. refiners have spent heavily on upgrades in recent years that allow them to process the ultra-light crude being pumped from U.S. shale fields. That means it probably makes more economic sense to leave American oil at home for now.",3973

Apple has reported the slowest growth in iPhone sales since the product's 2007 launch and warned sales will fall for the first time later this year.

The US tech giant sold 74.8 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter, compared with 74.5 million a year ago.

Apple said revenue for the next quarter would be between $50bn (£34bn; €46bn) and $53bn, below the $58bn it reported for the same period a year ago.

This would mark Apple's first fall in revenues since it launched the iPhone.

Despite first-quarter iPhone sales being below the 75 million expected by analysts, it was still a record quarter for the company.

Apple revenue in the three months to 26 December was $75.9bn and net profit was $18.4bn, both of which are the highest ever recorded by the company.

Sales of iPhones accounted for 68% of the company's revenue in the period.

Any other company announcing record profits and revenues might expect a warm welcome from investors. But now that Apple has scaled so many peaks the worry is that the only way is down - and there's evidence in these figures to back up those concerns.

Sales of the iPhone, surely the single most profitable product any company has produced, were basically flat. What's more, the revenue outlook for the next three months indicates we can expect the first fall in sales since the iPhone's 2007 launch.

Then there's China - still growing but far more slowly. The iPhone is still an object of desire there, but at a time when Apple says it's seeing softness in the economy, the attractions of cheaper rivals from local firms like Xiaomi may grow.

Of course, the worries about ""peak iPhone"" have surfaced before and evaporated with the hugely successful iPhone 6. Last year's upgrade to the 6S was a minor one, and we can expect something more radical in September.

But the pressure is now mounting on Apple to deliver another blockbuster product to keep the profit engine running.

The Apple watch will not fill that role - we've still not even heard any sales figures for the product.

Perhaps the 1,000 engineers rumoured to be working on an Apple Car will come up with the exciting innovation which Apple's fans and investors await with growing impatience.

Is the mighty iPhone in decline?

Chinese 'softness not seen before'

Apple boss Tim Cook credited ""all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV"" for the performance.

But the firm's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company was operating in ""a very difficult macroeconomic environment"".

He added that ""iPhone units will decline in the quarter"" and that the company was not projecting beyond those three months.

Mr Maestri partly blamed the strong US dollar for Apple's flat sales, estimating it had knocked $5bn off the company's revenues.

Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - rose 14%, but that was much slower than the 70% increase a year ago.

Mr Maestri said the softness in China was ""something that we have not seen before"", Reuters reported.

'Mother of all balance sheets'

China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined.

The profitability of Apple's business improved, with gross margin - or how much the company makes per product - increasing to 40.1%.

Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple was ""generating industry defying margins"" and had cash of almost $216bn.

Speaking to analysts, Mr Cook said the company had ""the mother of all balance sheets"" and that its financial position had never been stronger.

Apple's shares were down 2.7% in after hours trading at $97.28.

Daniel Ives, an analyst at Capital Markets who owns shares in Apple, said given the ""white knuckles fears"" ahead of the results, he would ""characterise the overall headline performance as better than feared"".",3958

Residents of Jiangxi and Foshan were stunned when they saw what they thought to be towering sky scrapers appearing from the clouds. While many believed they had seen a parallel universes , weather experts say the phenomenon was down to an optical illusion known as a Fata Morgana

A Fata Morgana is a type of mirage that distort distance objects, and can be can be seen on land or sea.

It's caused when the sun heats up the atmosphere above the land or oceans, which creates a gradient of temperatures.

The air close to the surface is relatively cool and above that, there are layers of warmer air.

When light hits a boundary between two layers that are different temperatures – and as a result different densities – it bends and travels at a different angle .

A close up of the 'floating city' which was created by an optical illusion. Some say it was a test by Nasa to develop holographic technology

Our brain assumes that light travels in a straight paths , so when it bends, we think the object is where it would be if the light's path runs straight.

In this case, light reflected from the skyscrapers is bent downward as it passes through the colder, denser air.

WHAT IS A FATA MORGANA? A Fata Morgana is a type of mirage that distort distance objects, and can be can be seen on land or sea. It's caused when the sun heats up the atmosphere above the land or oceans, which creates a gradient of temperatures.

Our brain assumes that light travels in a straight paths , so when it bends, we think the object is where it would be if the light's path runs straight.

Because the brain puts the object where it would be if the light traveled a straight path, the distant skyscrapers appear higher than they actually are.

Despite the simple explanation, the latest sightings have got conspiracy theorists excited.

YouTube channel Paranormal Crucible said in a video report: 'The footage captured by a local resident appears to show a huge city floating in the clouds

'The apparition, which was witnessed by hundreds of shocked residents, only lasted a few minutes before completely disappearing.'

The channel speculated it could be 'the result of a project blue beam test.'

Project Blue Beam is a conspiracy theory which claims Nasa will someday simulate an alien invasion of Earth or second coming of Christ through holograms.

Serge Monast, a conspiracist from Quebecois, first predicted in the 1980s it would happen by 1983, 1996 and then 2000.

One online poster noted: 'Notice the group of buildings is repeated three times? If it isn't someone making it on their computer, it seriously could be project blue beam.'

The Paranormal Crucible video added: 'But added: 'Or a temporal vortex, a possible parallel universe material briefly into our own reality.'

'It is also possible, considering China's technological achievements that a top secret holographic technology was tested over a heavily populated area in an effort to gauge the public reaction.'

A similar phantom city was seen over China in 2011. The phenomenon is a relatively common occurrence but still gets conspiracy theorists excited",3950

Transgender Bathroom Policy
Hits ""Boiling♨️Point""❗️

Target Corp will abandon its ill-fated expansion into Canada less than two years after launch, the U.S. discount retailer said on Thursday, in a surprise retreat that will put more than 17,000 employees out of work and cost it billions. The company is shutting all of its 133 Canadian stores and said it expects to report about .4 billion in pre-tax losses for its fourth quarter, which finishes at the end of January. Losses are mostly due to the writedown of the Canadian investment, along with exit costs and operating losses.

The massive Target boycott by over a million consumers over its decision to allow customers and employees to use the bathroom of their chosen identity rather than biological sex has reportedly reached a ""boiling point,"" with customers deciding to bring their business elsewhere.

The Business Insider reported on data supplied by YouGov BrandIndex, measuring consumer perceptions of major brands, and revealed that while 42 percent of consumers considered shopping from Target before the boycott, that number has now fallen to 36 percent.

""Consumer perception of the brand has also dropped sharply. It's at its lowest point in two years,"" the report noted.

Despite the drop, more people still hold a positive view of Target rather than a negative one, it added.

""There's a very large group out there that supports Target's decision,"" said crisis-management expert Kevin Dinino, CEO of San Diego-based KCD PR.

Dinino said that close to 80 million people shop at Target's stores nationwide each month, and estimated that 1.5 percent of its total customers, or 1.2 million shoppers, have been left due to its bathroom controversy.

Target explained that it wants to be more inclusive by allowing customers and employees to use the bathrooms of their choosing, and said in a statement: ""In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.""

Concerned parents have protested at several of the chain's stores nationwide, however, while a petition by the American Family Association has gathered over 1.2 million signatures, calling on the policy to be reversed.

""Target's policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims. And with Target publicly boasting that men can enter women's bathrooms, where do you think predators are going to go?"" the AFA's petition states.

""Clearly, Target's dangerous new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters. We think many customers will agree. And we think the average Target customer is willing to pledge to boycott Target stores until it makes protecting women and children a priority.""

Consumer backlash against Target also manifested itself in plummeting stock prices earlier this month, with the Family Policy Institute of Washington observing that the company's stock fell from $84.10 per share on April 19 to roughly $79.36 in the days surrounding the AFA petition, explaining that a loss of $4.74 per share ""would represent a corporate loss of over $2.5 billion,"" if constant.

Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell responded to the backlash last week by stating that the company will not be reversing its policy, but sought to assure customers that safety is a major priority for the company.

""Our focus on safety is unwavering. And we want to make sure we provide a welcoming environment for all of our guests,"" Cornell said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week.

He added: ""What's been lost in this story is the fact that the vast majority of our stores, over 1,400 of our stores, already have a family restroom. We are committed over the next few months to make sure every one of our stores has that option.""",3948

His mother and brother described Mr. Joshua as a young man who liked to joke, worked nights stocking shelves at Walmart and dreamed of becoming a rapper. He graduated from Jennings Senior High School in 2012, according to Tiffany Anderson, the district superintendent.

He lived with his mother, brother and two younger sisters, and was still trying to figure out his way in the world, his family said. He considered joining the Army or applying to community college, but let both options slide.

His family said Mr. Joshua had never joined the marches and protests over Mr. Brown’s shooting, even though, in a twist of fate, the twin brothers were childhood friends with a crucial figure in the case, the witness who was walking with Mr. Brown when he was killed.

“It was just something that happened,” Dont’A Joshua said of the Brown shooting.

The area where Mr. Joshua and Mr. Brown died is one of the more violent corners of Ferguson, accounting for 18 percent of all serious crimes reported from 2010 to August 2012, according to an analysis of crime statistics by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Mr. Joshua never told his family that he felt threatened there, and he did not seem to have any enemies, his mother and brother said. But as Ferguson grew tense as the grand jury prepared to decide the fate of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Mr. Brown, Ms. Joshua worried about Deandre, she said.

“I kept calling him that day, to tell him to be careful with this Ferguson riots,” she said. “And I never got an answer. I couldn’t get an answer.”

That night, Ms. Joshua said, Deandre watched the grand jury announcement with his aunt and two cousins on Winkler Drive, about a mile east of where his body was found. He was happy because Walmart had canceled his shift in anticipation of unrest.

Around 2 a.m., as a dozen buildings along West Florissant Avenue were burning and gunshots were crackling through the city, Ms. Joshua said, her son left his aunt’s home to make the short drive to the apartment of a girl he had been seeing for about a month. It is unclear how he ended up in the nearby parking lot of the Northwinds Apartments.

His death became fodder for online speculation, caught in the fervor over the unrest in Ferguson. People sifting through thousands of pages of redacted grand jury testimony from the Brown case posited that Mr. Joshua was one of the unnamed witnesses.

But Mr. Joshua’s family said he had known nothing about Mr. Brown’s death and never testified before the grand jury. A former girlfriend, Chasity Jones, a student at Southern Illinois University, said she and Mr. Joshua were at a St. Louis-area beauty salon in August when they heard news of Mr. Brown’s death.

Missouri court records show that Deandre Joshua was arrested once, on a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest, in April 2013, and had completed his sentence of community service and a year’s probation. A full record of the incident was not immediately available from the St. Louis County Police.

As it waits for answers, his family has started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover his funeral and burial. The family scans the online speculation about him, but tries to look beyond it. And Ms. Joshua said she found herself driving past that ordinary-looking parking lot.

“I don’t know why I go there — I just ride by,” she said. “That was the last place he was at.”",3895

But in centuries past, naturalists and others working out in the field would consult a color dictionary—a sort of pre-Pantone reference guide—to accurately describe a specimen they were sketching. That way, even if the color of the drawing might fade, the shade from the shared nomenclature of colors would remain as a guide for illustrators recreating the image back home.

One of the most famous and widely used color guides was Patrick Syme’s Werner’s Nomenclature of Colors, first published in 1814 and recently reissued by Smithsonian Books. Abraham Gottlob Werner was a German geologist who, toward the end of his long and distinguished career, threw himself into creating a new color dictionary with which to describe the cornucopia of hues found in rocks and minerals. Scottish botanical artist Patrick Syme was entranced by Werner’s work, which had been published at the end of the 18th century, and felt he could improve it further by adding painted color swatches—Werner used only written descriptions—and examples from flora and fauna alongside the mineral comparisons.



Smithsonian Books

Not all colors received an example from each kingdom in Syme's work, but many did. For example, brownish orange was noted as existing in “the eyes of the largest flesh-fly,” the “style of the orange lily,” or in “dark Brazillian topaz.” Blueish green was recorded as existing in “egg of thrush,” “under disk of wild rose leaves,” and the mineral beryl. Ash gray was to be seen in the “breast of long-tailed Hen Titmouse,” “Fresh Wood ashes,” and “Flint."" Syme ultimately created a reference work of 110 named colors, providing a whole new language with which to portray nature.

It was Werner’s Nomenclature of Colors that Charles Darwin took on his round-the-world voyage on the HMS Beagle from 1831–36. During the trip, Darwin spent a great deal of time collecting and recording natural history specimens, many of which would be dried and pressed or pickled in vinegar for preservation—processes that often caused the true colors to fade. Darwin consulted Werner’s Nomenclature frequently, confiding in fish expert Leonard Jenyns that “a comparison was always made with the book in hand, previous to the exact color in any case being noted.” Darwin’s written descriptions of the animals and plants he encountered are littered with color terms from the book, as when he describes the shades pulsating across the body of a cuttlefish as ""varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut brown.”



A page from Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours Smithsonian Books

It was not only the specimens that Darwin described using the color dictionary, but also the ever-changing hues of the sea. On March 28, 1832 he wrote, “During this day the colour of sea varied, being sometimes black ‘Indigo blue’, in evening very green.” Numerous other naturalists, such as Arctic explorer Sir William Edward Parry, botanist Sir William Hooker, and explorer and naturalist Sir John Richardson, also used Werner’s Nomenclature to standardize their description of color, with the evocative names like Orpiment Orange, Verditer Blue, and Gallstone Yellow adding a certain poetry to an otherwise functional description.

The reissue from Smithsonian Books recreates Syme's work in CMYK printing, bringing new vibrancy to the original and sometimes-faded shades. The book provides modern readers with an exploration of color through the eyes of 19th-century naturalists, whose perception of each hue would have been informed by the natural world around them. The lyrical descriptions offer a now-almost-forgotten language for color—less useful, perhaps, than a Pantone number, but a little more evocative.",3887

That the album finally materialized on Wednesday night, a little more than three years after Rihanna's last album, Unapologetic, still seems almost impossible.

Related Rihanna Surprise-Releases Eighth Album, 'Anti' Tidal-only release follows leak on Jay Z's streaming site

Rihanna released a smattering of singles last year, none of which appear on Anti; of those songs, the circuitous ""American Oxygen"" is probably the closest to this album sonically. On this album, Rihanna's focus is turned inward — toward herself and lovers who consistently disappoint her by not showing up, both emotionally and physically. Anti's equivalent of a ""banger"" is probably the first single, ""Work,"" released Wednesday morning. Rihanna lolls about over a spare beat (courtesy of Partynextdoor and Boi-1da), alternating regretful asides about loneliness with bedroom-related demands; Drake shows up to briefly act semi-sensitive, then (wisely) cedes the floor to his hostess/fixation. There's also ""Woo,"" a grinding-gears track full of barely enunciated spite that'll probably inspire quite a few scream-alongs on its defiant ""I don't even really care about you no more"" chorus. (Rumored paramour Travi$ Scott offers up a theremin impersonation and a couple of ""yeahs."")

But for the most part, Anti is brooding and at times claustrophobic, made for those lonely stretched-out moments in the aftermath of highs and thrills. An austere Timbaland beat anchors the exhausted come-on ""Yeah I Said It""; ""Kiss It Better"" is a gorgeously juicy slow jam that calls out to a departed lover over a thick guitar solo; the downcast ""Desperado"" turns Rihanna into a reluctant Lone Ranger, searching for someone to accompany her as she rides around a blasted-to-bits landscape. A gauzy, yet faithful cover of ""New Person, Same Old Mistakes"" by the Australian indie-psych outfit Tame Impala — called ""Same Ol' Mistakes,"" with production credited to Tame Impala mastermind Kevin Parker — opens with cymbal hits that fleetingly bring to mind the opening of Rihanna's 2007 megahit ""Umbrella,"" although the song that follows trips through lovelorn doubt in ways far removed from that brashly confident track.

The end of Anti plays out like the tail end of a night, when last-call bravado fades into something more thoughtful. ""Love on the Brain"" is rooted in buttoned-down music that sounds plucked from a mid-20th-century prom band's slow-dance repertoire, although the imagery Rihanna uses to describe love — ""fist-fighting with fire just to get close to you,"" ""it beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good"" — hints at something more desperate. ""Higher,"" meanwhile, is a brief drunk-dial (""This whiskey got me feelin' pretty/So pardon if I'm impolite,"" Rihanna wails at its outset) that cuts off just as she's about to launch into a more detailed description of her wanting. ""Close to You"" winds Anti down, Rihanna subdued and wistful over a tinkling piano, hesitantly beckoning toward a reluctant other.

Much of Rihanna's pop-cultural appeal — the fuel for the GIFs, the retweets, the excitable blog posts — comes from the way she seemingly exists on her own terms. The longer-than-usual gestation period for Anti was an extension of that pay-no-mind attitude, a change-up from the brutal album-of-bangers-a-year strategy that helped her exercise domination over the charts. Anti is particularly striking in this context; the ""Rihanna"" on this album is alone and yearning for more. That she's finding too-brief highs provided by drugs, sex and seemingly having it all instead of something more lasting is so exhausting that she can't not care — and Anti serves as a sometimes-frustrating, often-fascinating documentation of that all-encompassing weariness.",3880
524185876931162112,true,Puppy-sized spider surprises scientist in rainforest @LiveScience | http://t.co/xLnDsrJC3l http://t.co/LvWeWrL47Q,http://fxn.ws/1t2ePlj,True,Goliath encounter: Puppy-sized spider surprises scientist in rainforest,"Piotr Naskrecki was taking a nighttime walk in a rainforest in Guyana, when he heard rustling as if something were creeping underfoot. When he turned on his flashlight, he expected to see a small mammal, such as a possum or a rat.

""When I turned on the light, I couldn't quite understand what I was seeing,"" said Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology.

A moment later, he realized he was looking not at a brown, furry mammal, but an enormous, puppy-size spider.

Known as the South American Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), the colossal arachnid is the world's largest spider, according to Guinness World Records. Itsleg span can reach up to a foot (30 centimeters), or about the size of ""a child's forearm,"" with a body the size of ""a large fist,"" Naskrecki told Live Science. And the spider can weigh more than 6 oz., about as much as a young puppy, the scientist wrote on his blog. [See Photos of the Goliath Birdeater Spider]

Some sources say the giant huntsman spider, which has a larger leg span, is bigger than the birdeater. But the huntsman is much more delicate than the hefty birdeater comparing the two would be ""like comparing a giraffe to an elephant,"" Naskrecki said.

The birdeater's enormity is evident from the sounds it makes. ""Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse's hooves hitting the ground,"" he wrote, but ""not as loud.""

Prickly hairs and 2-inch fangs

When Naskrecki approached the imposing creature in the rainforest, it would rub its hind legs against its abdomen. At first, the scientist thought the behavior was ""cute,"" he said, but then he realized the spider was sending out a cloud of hairs with microscopic barbs on them. When these hairs get in the eyes or other mucous membranes, they are ""extremely painful and itchy,"" and can stay there for days, he said. [Creepy-Crawly Gallery: See Spooky Photos of Spiders]

But its prickly hairs aren't the birdeater's only line of defense; it also sports a pair of 2-inch-long fangs. Although the spider's bite is venomous, it's not deadly to humans. But it would still be extremely painful, ""like driving a nail through your hand,"" Naskrecki said.

And the eight-legged beast has a third defense mechanism up its hairy sleeve. The hairs on the front of the spider's body have tiny hooks and barbs that make a hissing sound when they rub against each other, ""sort of like pulling Velcro apart,"" Naskrecki said.

Yet despite all that, the spider doesn't pose a threat to humans. Even if it bites you, ""a chicken can probably do more damage,"" Naskrecki said.

Bird eater or mostly harmless?

Despite its name, the birdeater doesn't usually eat birds, although it is certainly capable of killing small mammals. ""They will essentially attack anything that they encounter,"" Naskrecki said.

The spider hunts in leaf litter on the ground at night, so the chances of it encountering a bird are very small, he said. However, if it found a nest, it could easily kill the parents and the chicks, he said, adding that the spider species has also been known to puncture and drink bird eggs.

The spider will eat frogs and insects, but its main prey is actually earthworms, which come out at night when it's humid. ""Earthworms are very nutritious,"" Naskrecki said.

Birdeaters are not very common spiders. ""I've been working in the tropics in South America for many, many years, and in the last 10 to 15 years, I only ran across the spider three times,"" Naskrecki.

After catching the specimen he found in Guyana, which was female, Naskrecki took her back to his lab to study. She's now deposited in a museum.

693686290408181760,non-rumor,"Today’s work world requires continuous growth and learning.
Here's a process to decide what skill to work on next: https://t.co/7V90tQwwQm",http://s.hbr.org/1KL4AaB,True,How to Decide What Skill to Work On Next,"Most of us know that success in today’s work world requires continuous growth and learning. You can’t just rely on your current knowledge and expertise if you expect to keep up, let alone advance. But how do you identify the areas in which development efforts will yield the best return on your investment?

In our years coaching executives, my colleagues and I have noticed that people who improve in ways that best support their success look for the overlap between what their organization needs and what will give them the most satisfaction. We’ve discovered that using a version of Jim Collins’s “hedgehog” idea, from Good to Great, helps clients think it through. Collins found that great organizations focus on three things: what will drive their economic engine, what they can be best in the world at, and what they are most passionate about. The approach, he has noted, is just as good for figuring out how to become “great” individually. Here’s how it works:

Driving the economic engine: We encourage executives to focus on this element first. How can you grow in a way that will help the organization succeed? For example, if you’re in operations, you might identify several business-critical areas for improvement. By learning to better manage large custom client projects, you could significantly reduce cycle and delivery times. By becoming more knowledgeable about sourcing materials, you could reduce expenses. And by improving your communication skills and setting clearer direction for your employees, you could boost productivity. All three could positively impact the bottom line.

Best at: Once you’ve surfaced useful capabilities you might develop, think about whether you could become really excellent at them. One way to do that is to consider whether you’re good at doing similar things. For instance, if you’re already quite organized and sequential when you approach your tasks, that bodes well for being able to learn complex project management. And if you’re already clear in your own mind about what needs to be done and who’s best to do it, you could probably learn to more effectively share that thinking with your team. On the other hand, if you’re just OK at research, getting really good at sourcing materials might be difficult.

Passionate about: As soon as you’ve gotten a sense of where your potential strengths match up with useful areas for development, honestly assess how interested you are in those areas. Let’s say, for example, that of the two skills you believe you could get quite good at — project management and providing clearer direction — you’re much more interested in and excited about the former. As an ops person, the idea of taking a formal course on process architecture really appeals to you; working on your “soft skills” does not. So go ahead and sign up for the process seminar. But also recognize that you have more control over this element of the “hedgehog” model than any other. You can, in fact, increase your desire to learn particular skills simply by identifying the personal benefits of doing so and then envisioning a future in which you’re reaping those benefits. For example, getting better at talking to employees about goals and timelines and giving them balanced feedback might create a more positive team culture and demonstrate that you’re worthy of being promoted to a more senior management role. Picture your team proud and happy and your boss congratulating you on those accomplishments. Chances are you’ll now be more interested in working to improve those skills.

Given all the ways in which organizations and jobs are changing, figuring out which new skills to develop and when to develop them can be hard. The key is to focus on skills that will propel your organization forward, that play to your strengths, and that you feel passionate about learning.",3842
691206970074738688,non-rumor,Greek islanders to be nominated for Nobel peace prize https://t.co/m1jbhLml8N https://t.co/epibkeZVoy,http://d.gu.com/KDW4nt,True,Greek islanders to be nominated for Nobel peace prize,"International group of academics to propose those on frontline of refugee crisis be commended for their ‘empathy and self-sacrifice’

Greek islanders who have been on the frontline of the refugee crisis are to be nominated for the Nobel peace prize with the support of their national government.

Of the 900,000 refugees who entered Europe last year most were received –scared, soaked and travelling in rickety boats – by those who live on the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

The islanders, including fishermen who gave up their work to rescue people from the sea, are in line to be honoured with one of the world’s most esteemed awards. Eminent academics from the universities of Oxford, Princeton, Harvard, Cornell and Copenhagen are drafting a submission in favour of awarding the prize to the people of Lesbos, Kos, Chíos, Samos, Rhodes and Leros.

The nomination deadline is 1 February, but those behind the plan have already met the Greek minister for migration, Yiannis Mouzalas, who they say has offered his government’s full support. A petition on the website of the grassroots campaign group, Avaaz, in favour of the nomination has amassed 280,000 signatures. According to the petition: “On remote Greek islands, grandmothers have sung terrified little babies to sleep, while teachers, pensioners and students have spent months offering food, shelter, clothing and comfort to refugees who have risked their lives to flee war and terror.”

While the official nomination letter is yet to be finalised, it is understood the academics, whose identities will be revealed in the coming days, will implore the Nobel committee members to accept their nomination.

They will say that it must be noted that a people of a country already dealing with its own economic crisis responded to the unfolding tragedy of the refugee crisis with “empathy and self-sacrifice”, opening their homes to the dispossessed, risking their lives to save others and taking care of the sick and injured.

In December, the image of Antonis Deligiorgis, a 34-year-old Greek army sergeant, rescuing an Eritrean refugee from the turbulent waters off Rhodes, was singled out as a striking illustration of the valour of those in the islands.

Only individuals or organisations are eligible to win the prize so it is likely that the “solidarity networks” on the islands – groups of volunteers who organised to help the refugees – or individuals within groups will be the official nominees. A precedent was set in 1976 when Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan won the prize for their efforts in seeking peace in Northern Ireland. It was seen as a reward for all those who sought reconciliation during the most troubled years.

The volunteer networks on the Greek islands have provided accommodation, hygiene packs, food, dry clothes and help with the next steps for refugees. However, it is claimed that the instincts of the majority of islanders set the tone across Europe towards the refugees’ plight.

Spyro Limneos, an activist in Greece for Avaaz who distributed aid on the islands, said: “The people involved in the solidarity networks organised and helped the desperate when the governments weren’t even willing to recognise that the there was a crisis.

“By opening their hearts the islanders sent a powerful message that humanity is above races, above nations.

“I will never forget seeing young girls being rescued from a boat on Leros. They were smiling. They didn’t have suitcases or any possessions except their end-of-year school certificates written in Arabic. They laid those down in the sun to dry out. It was a combination of tragedy and hope.”

One of the organisers of the Solidarity Networks, Matina Katsiveli, 61, a retired judge who lives on Leros, welcomed the move but said there was “reward enough in the smiles of the people we help”.",3834

Universal and the team behind Fast & Furious 7 are facing a delay in production following the tragic death of actor Paul Walker, but sources say the movie will not be abandoned entirely.

Walker, along with the rest of the cast and crew of Fast 7, had been scheduled to return to Atlanta on Sunday to resume shooting the big-budget film, which features extensive car racing. Those plans are on hold until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest.

PHOTOS: Paul Walker and Other Notable Deaths of 2013

Director James Wan and Universal executives held a conference call Sunday morning to discuss the state of the film, whether rewrites would be necessary and how to proceed in a manner that would be respectful to Walker's death. Walker, 40, was a favorite on the set of the Fast movies, and his death has left his fellow stars, including Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, and the crew devastated.

Fast 7, which was well underway shooting in Atlanta, was on hiatus for the Thanksgiving holiday. Walker had returned to Southern California when the limited-edition Porsche he was a passenger in crashed Saturday afternoon in Valencia, bursting into flames. The driver has been identified as Roger Rodas, a well-respected financial adviser and the CEO of Walker's company Always Evolving (the duo met because of their shared passion for cars).

Walker was reprising his role as Brian O'Conner in Fast 7. The seventh film in the racing-centric action franchise is slated to hit theaters July 11. The film is on an expedited schedule in order to make that release date (Justin Lin, the director of previous installments, bowed out in part because he didn't want to work on the speedy timeline), so any delay in production could impact that release date. In addition, marketing Fast 7 could pose a challenge, considering Walker died in a crash of a flashy car similar to those used in the movies.

PHOTOS: Paul Walker's Career in Pictures

Insiders say a large part of the film had been shot, although in January, Walker and the rest of the Fast 7 team were scheduled to travel to Abu Dhabi to film additional scenes.

""All of us at Universal are heartbroken,"" a studio spokesperson said in a statement Saturday night. ""Paul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family for 14 years, and this loss is devastating to us, to everyone involved with the Fast and Furious films, and to countless fans. We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul's family.""

The studio declined to comment on the future of Fast 7.

In January 2008, director Terry Gilliam faced a similar situation when Heath Ledger died in the middle of shooting The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. The independent film suspended production temporarily. Ultimately, Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell came aboard to portray various versions of Ledger's character.

Ledger's death also came just as Warner Bros. was ramping up marketing for The Dark Knight. The studio didn't shy away from showing images of Ledger as the Joker throughout the campaign, despite the macabre nature of Ledger's character.

STORY: Hollywood Pays Tribute to Paul Walker

Two films starring Walker are awaiting release: Hurricane Katrina drama Hours, due out in December, and Brick Mansions, now in postproduction. Brick Mansions, from EuropaCorp and Relativity Media, is an English-language remake of the 2004 French action movie District B13.

Pantelion Films, a joint venture between Lionsgate and Televisa, acquired North American rights to Hours in August and is tentatively planning a dual release in theaters and on VOD.",3773

Hunter Cmelo and his family have a new minivan thanks to the local businesses in Medford, Oregon, and Grants Pass, Oregon, and a local radio host who heard his story.

The 6-year-old arrived late to Lincoln Elementary School last week because his family was having car trouble.

“[The school has] a policy where every three tardies, you get a detention,” Hunter’s mother, Nicole Garloff, 25, of Grants Pass, told ABC News. “Every tardy after that, you get a detention.”

Garloff said they knew Hunter would be getting a detention that day and that he was crying when he went in that morning. But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.

“He was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,” Garloff said.

She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn’t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.

“I was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,” said Garloff. “He wasn’t tardy so many times that he deserved that.

After Garloff posted the photo on her , the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.

“We see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,” Meyer told ABC News. “I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.”

So Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly’s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family’s Dodge Durango.

“The repairs were more than what the car was actually worth,” McClease-Kelly told ABC News. Luckily, a local company, Rapid Repo and Collections, offered to donate a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van to the family.

Other local businesses pitched in to install a new windshield in the van, two new tires, and McClease-Kelly put about $1,400 of maintenance into it. Hunter’s family was surprised when they came to the shop this week.

“We thought we were going there to be told that our Durango was not going to be fixable at all,” Garloff said. “We were so shocked, it doesn’t seem real. I’m trying to tell Hunter that this doesn’t just happen to you.”

McClease-Kelly will give the family free oil changes for a year, and many others who heard their story donated to give the family a gas card, as well as gift cards to local restaurants.

“This family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change the school policy,” Meyer said. “We saw a way to do a little nudge, and then everyone else came in with their time and generosity.”

The school policy has since been amended, according to the Grants Pass District Superintendent’s office.

“As a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,” the Grants Pass District said in a statement. “Going forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.”

Garloff said Hunter hasn’t been late since the family got the van and that she is waiting to see if the school’s policy will change.

“We’re so thankful to all the people in our community that have just been so supportive,” Garloff said.",3759

Hunter Cmelo and his family have a new minivan thanks to the local businesses in Medford, Oregon, and Grants Pass, Oregon, and a local radio host who heard his story.

The 6-year-old arrived late to Lincoln Elementary School last week because his family was having car trouble.

“[The school has] a policy where every three tardies, you get a detention,” Hunter’s mother, Nicole Garloff, 25, of Grants Pass, told ABC News. “Every tardy after that, you get a detention.”

Garloff said they knew Hunter would be getting a detention that day and that he was crying when he went in that morning. But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.

“He was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,” Garloff said.

She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn’t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.

“I was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,” said Garloff. “He wasn’t tardy so many times that he deserved that.

After Garloff posted the photo on her , the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.

“We see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,” Meyer told ABC News. “I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.”

So Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly’s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family’s Dodge Durango.

In preparing to film “Southside With You,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this week, Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter had some impressive shoes to fill. In the film, they play Barack and Michelle Obama (née Robinson) as they were in 1989: he, a Harvard Law summer associate at a prestigious Chicago firm, and she, an ambitious young lawyer and his adviser. Telling the story of their first date, it’s the first major depiction of the Obamas in a feature film, and Sawyers and Sumpter portray the future first couple with such sweetness and magnetism that you’d be forgiven for thinking them an item offscreen. But it didn’t come without baggage. “I was worried that the CIA would come shut us down!” Sumpter says, laughing. “It is the leader of the free world, after all.”

The actress, who also serves as a producer on the film, was on board with the project from the beginning, but Sawyers may never have gotten the part it weren’t for a technical glitch. When the 32-year-old actor, who was born and raised in Indianapolis but lives in London, sent in his first audition tape, he was doing a pitch-perfect impersonation of the president at 54, rather than at 28. After he didn’t hear back, he readied a second tape — which never made it to the film’s director, Richard Tanne. “My wife and I did the tape, edited it, and were trying to upload it to Vimeo, but it was going super slow,” he says. “It was like 36 percent loaded, and it was late in London, so all I could think was, ‘God, I’m going to be up another couple hours.’” Just as the tape was about to send, Sawyers received an email from his manager with notes from Tanne telling him to strip back his performance. He adjusted accordingly, and was soon awarded the part, his first lead role in a film. “Thank God for slow Wi-Fi,” he says.

For Sumpter, 35, whose past credits include the CW teen series “Gossip Girl” and the 2014 action comedy “Ride Along,” playing the First Lady was always about “embodying her essence” rather than straight imitation. She employed a dialect coach to nail her speech patterns and picked up clues about her life as a young woman from the memoir “A Game of Character,” written by Michelle’s brother, Craig Robinson. Both Sumpter and Sawyers listened to recordings of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gwendolyn Brooks and read Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man,” trying to put themselves in the context of the young couple when they first fell in love. Sawyers even smoked Obama’s preferred Marlboro cigarettes — which can be seen throughout the film — and scoured YouTube for clips of the president during candid moments. “There’s a video from the 2014 midterm election when he’s voting and some guy goes, ‘Don’t touch my girlfriend,’ and he says, ‘I really wasn’t planning on it.’ He could ignore the guy, but he made a joke instead. And he’s the president!”

“Southside With You” won fans at its premiere, but it has yet to reach its most famous audience: the Obamas. During a Q&A after the screening, Tanne said the president and first lady are aware of the film, if “a little baffled by its existence.” For their part, the actors are cautiously optimistic about the couple seeing their work. “I’d probably just stare at him and wait for him to speak,” says Sawyers. “I’d honestly be honored for him to see anything I’ve done, let alone me playing him.” As for the question of whether he thinks the film can reach both sides of the political divide, Sawyers is more confident. “If people on the right do want to see it, I’m pretty sure they’ll walk away delighted,” he says. “It’s the answer to the age-old question at any dinner party: How did you meet? What was your first date like?” Adds Sumpter, “Who doesn’t relate to love?”",3751
752965545528528898,unverified,Homicide is among the top five causes of death in adolescents https://t.co/zzj5Y7Z3nv #ENDviolence https://t.co/KzsEeTYkk6,http://goo.gl/41Z0aA,True,New strategies to end violence against children,"New strategies to end violence against children

12 July 2016 - WHO and partners today launch 7 interlinked strategies to reduce violence against children. The approaches have all been tested and all have shown concrete results. By bringing them together, WHO hopes to dramatically reduce instances of violence against children.

Over the past year, up to 1 billion children have experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence, according to a recent study published in “Pediatrics”. Homicide is among the top 5 causes of death for adolescents. 1 in 4 children suffer physical abuse, and nearly 1 in 5 girls are sexually abused at least once in their lives.

The 7 strategies highlighted in the “INSPIRE” package are:

Implementation and enforcement of laws: such as those limiting access by young people to firearms and other weapons (South Africa) and those criminalizing the violent punishment of children by parents (many European countries).

Norms and values: by changing beliefs and behaviours around gender roles (India, South Africa, Uganda and the United States).

Safe environments: by targeting violent “hotspots” and enhancing the built environment, for example, by improving housing (Colombia, United Kingdom, and the United States).

Parent and caregiver support: such as the provision of training in parenting (Kenya, Liberia, Myanmar, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States).

Income and economic strengthening: including microfinance combined with training around gender norms (Afghanistan, Cote d’Ivoire, South Africa, Uganda, and the United States).

Response and support services: such as treatment programmes for juvenile offenders (many European countries and the United States).

Education and life skills: for example, establishing a safe school environment and improving children’s life and social skills (China, Croatia, South Africa, Uganda, and the United States).

“Knowledge about the extent and harms of violence against children is growing, together with evidence about effective strategies for prevention”, notes Dr Etienne Krug, Director at WHO. “Now we need to build on that knowledge to work collectively to create the safe, stable, and nurturing environments that protect children and adolescents from violent harm.”

The new package has been produced in collaboration with partners including: End Violence Against Children, Together for Girls, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), US Agency for International Development (USAID), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank. The package is being released in the context of the worldwide launch of the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children.

The partnership aims to bring together governments, UN agencies, civil society, the private sector, researchers, and academics to build political will, promote solutions, accelerate action and strengthen collaboration to prevent violence against children. WHO is a founding member of the partnership, and will support work to implement strategies in countries.

The initiative also aims to support achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDG target 16.2 to “end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children”, and implementation of World Health Assembly resolution WHA69.5 on the “WHO global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children”.

489836271049928704,false,Could a Buk surface-to-air missile system have brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17? http://t.co/gElXLSMNzB #MH17 http://t.co/mbUz2pAYAo,http://on.mash.to/WferTt,True,The Weapon That Ukraine Says Shot Down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17,"Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was reportedly shot down on Thursday over Ukraine carrying 295 people. Investigators now will have to grapple with two questions: who took it down — and how?

The plane was reportedly flying at an altitude of 10 kilometers (roughly 33,000 feet) near the Ukrainian-Russian border when it went down. While it's unclear who shot the missile, it's likely that the plane was indeed taken down, experts say.

Considering the altitude and location, however, ""there are a lot of different systems deployed in that area, both in Ukraine and Russia, that could potentially have taken it down,"" Sim Tack, a security analyst at Stratfor, told Mashable.

Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have been known to use the surface-to-air Buk missile system, also known as SA-11 or SA-17 and the next-generation S-300 and S-400 missiles. And despite the fact that there is no confirmation of the exact locations of these systems, considering the current situation between Ukraine and Russia, it's ""very likely that high-end air defense systems are located in that area,"" Tack said.

A Ukrainian government adviser, Anton Gerashenko, also said the plane was taken down by a missile fired from a Buk launcher, a system developed by the former Soviet Union.

Nick de Larrinaga, a defense analyst at London-based think tank IHS Jane's , echoed that point, saying that medium-altitude SAM missile systems such as the 9K37 Buk (also known as the SA-11 'Gadfly') or the S-300 (aka SA-10 ‘Grumble) ""could all have been used in this scenario.""

“Russia and Ukraine have such SAM systems in their inventories,” de Larrinaga said.

A launcher that looked like a Buk missile system was spotted by Associated Press reporters on Thursday near the eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne, according to an AP report.

Given that these systems could conceivably hit a plane at that altitude, the bigger question remains: who fired the missile?

Both the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russia separatist rebels denied shooting down the commercial plane. And it remains unclear whether the rebels had access to one of these complex system. Moreover, the system entails significant training, Tack said.

In the past few weeks, there have been numerous reports of rebels shooting airplanes down in Ukraine using so-called manpads or portable surface-to-air missile systems. These, however, don't have the capability of reaching a plane flying at 10 kilometer, Tack said.

A Twitter account associated with pro-Russian rebels apparently posted a picture of a Buk system before the tweet was deleted — leading some to suspect the rebels might have gotten their hands on one of these systems.

While it is hard to establish whether Russia provided the systems to the pro-Russian rebels, the militants could have found Buk systems in Ukrainian stockpiles, Sam Brannen, the deputy director of the CSIS International Security Program, told Mashable.

UPDATE, 5:04 p.m. ET: U.S. intelligence officials believe the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, according to a The Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous sources.

Say “Aloha” to the good life if you’re lucky enough to be able to move to Hawaii.

People who live in the postcard-beautiful state have the highest overall well-being in the U.S., according to the 2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index released on Thursday. The report measures how Americans feel about their physical health, social connections, finances, community and sense of purpose.

The islands took the top spot for the fifth time since the annual state rankings began eight years ago.

“It’s not ever a shock to see Hawaii high (on the list),” Dan Witters, principal research director of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, told TODAY.

“Hawaiians rate their lives pretty high… things like enjoyment, smiling and laughter and happiness are all very high in Hawaii. And stress is very low.”

Hawaii has the lowest depression rate and the best exercise rate in the nation, Witters said. Very few people who live there are obese or smoke — a good formula for good health.

Alaska, last year’s overall well-being champ, fell to second place.

The top five states for overall well-being are:

1. Hawaii

2. Alaska

3. Montana

4. Colorado

5. Wyoming

On the opposite side of the spectrum, West Virginia was at the bottom of the list, coming in 50th for the seventh year in a row, Witters said.

“West Virginia is a low well-being place,” he noted. “They experience a lot of sadness, a lot of worry, a lot of stress on any given day.”

Residents there reported some of the worst rates in the nation for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, depression, physical pain and heart attacks. The state’s obesity rate was the highest in the U.S., at 37 percent, while its exercise rate was the lowest.

The five states at the bottom of the list are:

50. West Virginia

49. Kentucky

48. Oklahoma

47. Ohio

46. Indiana

The index is based on interviews with more than 177,000 Americans over the past year. Here are some of the report’s other key findings:

Americans evaluated their lives overall better in 2015 than in any other year

The researchers asked people to imagine a ladder with 10 rungs, where the top rung is best possible life, and bottom is the worst possible life. Where are you on that ladder?

The results were the highest since the index began. The number of people considered to be “thriving” is now at 55 percent, compared to barely over 40 percent during the Great Recession.

The state with the least stress is…

South Dakota.

“One of the things we find fairly consistently in the Northern Plains and Mountain West is stress levels are lower. Daily sadness and worry tends to be lower. People don’t carry around a lot of emotional baggage on a day to day basis,” Witters said.

Find bliss in the Centennial State

Besides Hawaii, Colorado is the only other state to finish in the top 10 in all eight years of the index’s rankings.

Residents there take good care of themselves and exercise a lot, Witters noted. Coloradans also report good community well-being, so they feel good about where they live, he added.

Related: Retirement boosts happiness, improves health, study finds

Beautiful surroundings don’t always translate into high well-being

Many states that historically rank high on the list don’t necessarily have gorgeous scenery or year-round warm weather, like Hawaii.

The local culture and how people feel about their communities play bigger roles in well-being than the physical beauty of a state, Witters said.",3695

Paul Manafort, campaign chairman for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has resigned just two months after taking the helm.

He has come under fire for his ties to Russian interests and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

But he has denied any wrongdoing and it is not yet clear why he left.

The team was overhauled earlier this week with the addition of a new campaign chief executive and a new campaign manager.

Mr Trump, who arrived in Louisiana on Friday to meet flood victims, has come under pressure in recent weeks after a series of controversial remarks and falling poll numbers.

Why he quit - Jane O'Brien, BBC News, Washington

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Jane O'Brien says Manafort quit because of falling support for Trump

Mr Manafort's lobbying connections to pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine are certainly a distraction for Mr Trump's presidential campaign - but unlikely to be the main reason for his departure.

In spite of Mr Manafort's efforts to impose discipline on the Republican nominee, Mr Trump continues to do badly in the polls and has reportedly bristled at efforts to bring him under control.

After all, ""being Trump"" is how he won the nomination in the first place.

His new team now faces the task of allowing him to be himself while making sure he stays on message - attacking his Democratic rival Hilary Clinton instead of sparking controversy with his own verbal missteps.

""This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,"" Mr Trump said in a statement.

""I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process.""

Mr Manafort has faced public scrutiny in recent weeks after the New York Times reported that the Ukrainian government had uncovered ledgers pledging more than $12m (£9.2m) in undisclosed cash payments for his work with Mr Yanukovych, who fled after an uprising in November 2013.

Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Bureau is also investigating business deals worth millions of dollar that are linked to Mr Manafort.

He has vehemently dismissed the claims and denied any wrongdoing.

A spokesman for Hillary Clinton said Mr Manafort was another example of Mr Trump's ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn't end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin,"" Robbie Mook said. ""Trump still has to answer serious questions hovering over his campaign given his propensity to parrot Putin's talking points.""

Mr Manafort, a former adviser to George HW Bush and Bob Dole, only joined the Trump campaign in March, to help the New Yorker secure the party's nomination. He was promoted to campaign manager in June.

The announcement of new campaign chief, Kellyanne Conway, and campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon, earlier this week raised questions about whether it would diminish Mr Manafort's role.

The longtime Republican operative was considered a guiding hand in steering Mr Trump toward a more conventional campaign as opposed to the anti-establishment brand of politics that made his primary campaign successful.

A hotel developer with no previous experience of politics, Mr Trump stunned the political world by beating far more experienced figures in the Republican Party.

He faces Mrs Clinton, who has come under intense criticism over her email arrangements while secretary of state, in November's election.",3669

In the video produced by ISIS' media wing and posted on Twitter, a masked militant with a British-sounding accent addresses U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, before appearing to behead Haines.

(Warning: disturbing image below)

A 44-year-old father of two from Scotland, Haines was abducted in Syria last year while working for the French aid agency ACTED. He appeared in a video earlier this month showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff, just weeks after the group sparked worldwide revulsion by beheading U.S. reporter James Foley.

Following the pattern of the previous videos, the clip begins with news footage of Cameron discussing his policy towards the militant group, before showing Haines kneeling in the sand, wearing an orange jumpsuit, as he makes a statement. The militant warns Britain will be dragged into ""another bloody and unwinnable war"" for helping to arm the Kurdish Peshmerga force battling the group in Iraq.

The man later threatens another hostage, who also appears in the video, saying he is British national Alan Henning. According to Syrians who wrote on Twitter that they recognized the man, Henning is an also aid worker captured while working in Syria.

The British government's Foreign Office said it was working urgently to verify the video, the Associated Press reported. ""If true, this is another disgusting murder,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement. ""We are offering the family every support possible. They ask to be left alone at this time.""

Prime Minister Cameron decried the killing as ""pure evil"" and vowed to find the killers, in a post on his official Twitter account. The BBC reported that Cameron had called an emergency government meeting.

The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) September 13, 2014

We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) September 13, 2014

A statement from the White House said, ""The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL. Our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.""

Haines' wife Dragana, who is from Croatia, described David as a ""fantastic man and father,"" to Britain's The Telegraph newspaper earlier this month. ""He's everything to us. He's our life,"" she said.

Haines worked for several aid agencies in Croatia, helping to rebuild homes after the Balkans war, the newspaper said. He worked in Libya and South Sudan before he arrived in Syria, where he was abducted in March 2013. The British government kept his capture a secret out of concern for his safety, according to the Associated Press.

The Islamic State is waging a bloody military offensive in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. government has vowed to assist fighters fending off the extremist group's advance. The U.S. has launched over 150 airstrikes targeting the group in Iraq in recent weeks, and is preparing to expand the campaign to Syria. As well as the American and British hostages, the militants have also beheaded Lebanese soldiers they captured in a border raid, and scores of rival fighters and civilians in Iraq and Syria.",3648

Chelsea Clinton implies that marijuana can kill you.

2016, y’all.

https://t.co/ThWiCUQspN #mmot #p2 #tcot #tlot",http://www.marijuana.com/blog/news/2016/09/chelsea-clinton-implies-marijuana-can-kill-you/,True,Chelsea Clinton Implies Marijuana Can Kill You,"The former and possible future first daughter of the United States acknowledges that marijuana has medical value, but she also seems to believe that cannabis use can lead to death.

“Anecdotally we have lots of evidence in…epilepsy but also in autism, in stimulating appetite for people who are on intensive chemotherapy regimens, for people who have non-epilepsy seizure disorders and challenges,” Chelsea Clinton said on Saturday.

“But we also have anecdotal evidence now from Colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the coroner believes, after they died, there was drug interactions with other things they were taking.”

Clinton, the daughter of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, was answering a question about her mother’s position on marijuana rescheduling during an appearance before a group of students at Youngstown State University in Ohio.

The Clinton campaign did not respond to Marijuana.com’s request for clarification about what the candidate’s daughter was referring to in implying that marijuana use has been tied to deaths apparently caused by its interaction with other drugs.

Legalization opponents have attempted to blame a handful of deaths in Colorado on cannabis edibles, but in those cases — one in which a college student visiting the state from Wyoming leapt off a balcony and one in which a man shot his wife to death — no other drugs were involved, so there are no “interactions” to speak of. And in the latter case, the suspect did not die so there was no coroner examination of him.

Elsewhere in the weekend remarks, Clinton reiterated her mother’s pledge to respect the right of states to implement their own marijuana laws without federal interference.

“She supports states making whatever choices they think are right vis–à–vis medical or recreational marijuana use,” she said.

But while candidate Clinton has said she is “100 percent in favor of medical uses for marijuana,” Chelsea implied that she wants cannabis to go through the Food and Drug Administration approval process, which she called the “gold standard for the world” even though the agency has approved a number of drugs that later proved to be very dangerous.

“We just need so much more data than we have so that people who might benefit have the chance to benefit, people who might be in danger are protected,” she said. “So absolutely my mom strongly supports the need for more rigorous study and then subjecting it, as we do kind of everything else that might have a medicinal purpose, to FDA approval, scrutiny and ultimately regulation.”

Her mother has promised that if elected she will reclassify marijuana to Schedule II from its current status under Schedule I, the most restrictive category.

Last month, the Drug Enforcement Administration, acting on a recommendation from FDA, denied long-pending petitions to reschedule cannabis.

Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump face off in the first of three scheduled presidential debates Monday night.

It has been suggested that Clinton’s struggling outreach to millennial voters could be strengthened by endorsing marijuana legalization. Young people overwhelmingly support ending cannabis prohibition, and polls show that a sizable chunk are now supporting Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein, both of whom have made marijuana law reform centerpieces of their campaigns.

The Colombian government and the left-wing Farc rebel movement have both asked the UN for a mission to oversee the end of their decades-long conflict.

Negotiators for the two sides at peace talks in Cuba said they would ask the UN to send a 12-month mission to oversee any ceasefire.

The UN has yet to agree to the proposal. The two sides have been holding peace talks for three years.

Both sides say they hope to reach a final peace deal by March 2016.

The BBC's Colombia correspondent Natalio Cosoy says the mechanism would only start to work once a final deal is agreed.

However both sides have insisted the announcement is more than a mere formality, suggesting it should be read as a signal that a definite deal is close, our correspondent adds.

""We have decided to ask the UN Security Council to create (a mission) of unarmed observers for a period of 12 months,"" the two sides said in a joint statement at peace talks in the Cuban capital, Havana, on Tuesday.

They said the mission would guarantee that any ceasefire and disarmament would be genuine and permanent, reports say.

Humberto de la Calle, the government's lead negotiator, described the announcement as a ""transcendental"" moment.

He said it was an ""unequivocal demonstration of our desire to end confrontation"", according to the Associated Press.

Peace process moving to final phase - by Leonardo Rocha, Americas Editor, BBC World Service

The joint announcement in Havana is a clear indication that the Colombian peace process is moving towards its final phase.

Since the negotiations were launched in November 2012, the Farc has announced several unilateral ceasefires and urged the government to do the same.

But even though the government has scaled down military operations recently, it has refused to join the Farc in a bilateral ceasefire.

President Juan Manuel Santos has said repeatedly that the rebels must first agree to lay down their weapons and give up their armed struggle.

Government and negotiators have now invited the UN Security Council to join them as an honest, reliable broker and oversee the end of the conflict.

The two sides have invested too much politically to let more than three years of negotiations fail at such a late stage, when difficult issues such as justice for the victims have been dealt with.

The Farc and the Colombian government seem to be working together now towards a safe, smooth landing.

An estimated 220,000 people have been killed in the fighting between Farc and the Colombian military, which began in 1964. It is the longest-running armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere.

Since official peace talks started in Havana in November 2012, negotiators have reached agreement on key issues such as the political participation of the rebels, land rights, drug trafficking and transitional justice.

However it is unclear whether a final deal can be reached by the 23 March deadline set last year.

In September, President Juan Manuel Santos and Farc chief Timoleon Jimenez, known as Timochenko, said they wanted an agreement within six months.

But the Farc said last week that ""substantial hurdles"" were putting the deadline under threat.

The request for a UN mission comes two days after Cuban President Raul Castro met with negotiators from both sides of the conflict.",3619

“The Banksy arrest is a hoax,” the street artist’s publicist, Jo Brooks, told The Independent.

However, the prank seems to have duped the internet, with his name quickly trending on Twitter.

A false story, published on US website National Report, alleged that the identity of the British street artist had finally been revealed and he had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police and is being held “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

The story claimed that Banksy’s London art studio had been raided, where “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” were found, along with ID thought to belong to the famed anonymous street artist, which allegedly identified him as Liverpool-born Paul Homer.

However, a quick Google search shows that the quotes were originally published in 2013 on hoax website on PRLog.

(Reuters) - Missouri’s governor declared a state of emergency on Monday and authorized the state’s National Guard to support police in case of violence after a grand jury decides whether to indict a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager.

“As part of our ongoing efforts to plan and be prepared for any contingency, it is necessary to have these resources in place in advance of any announcement of the grand jury’s decision,” Governor Jay Nixon said in a statement. The order also puts the St. Louis County Police Department, rather than police in Ferguson, Missouri, in charge of policing protests.

Residents of Ferguson, which saw weeks of sometimes violent protests following the Aug. 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, are braced for the possibility of more unrest, particularly if the grand jury decides not to criminally charge Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

The past two days have seen protests around the area in anticipation of the grand jury’s report. Several dozen demonstrators took to the streets on Monday in Clayton, Missouri, where a grand jury is meeting.

“We want an indictment. The cops don’t like it,” the protesters chanted as they marched in freezing temperatures.

“Something about the way Mike Brown was killed started a fire in me that I can’t ignore,” said one of the demonstration’s organizers, Dhorbua Shakur, 24.

He said he had little sympathy for area residents who are tired of the demonstrations, which left some businesses in Ferguson burned out.

“They can turn this off and on with a TV screen. But this is my reality. This is my life,” Shakur said.

DECISION EXPECTED THIS MONTH

Some area schools have told parents they will dismiss students early when the decision comes and many businesses near the stretch of downtown that saw the worst rioting after Brown’s killing have boarded up their windows as a protective move.

Officials have said the grand jury’s decision is likely to come this month.

Video and audio published over the weekend by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed Wilson leaving the police station and returning to it hours after the shooting.

There are conflicting accounts of what happened, with some witnesses saying Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was shot and others describing a physical altercation between Brown and Wilson.

Many protesters expressed anger at word over the weekend that Wilson may be able to return to his job if he is not indicted, although local police said he would be fired immediately if charges are brought.

Protest organizers planned to demonstrate at the Ferguson Police Department when the grand jury’s decision comes back, and later at the county courthouse in Clayton.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles expressed confidence on Monday in the city’s police department and its chief, Thomas Jackson.

“Right now, what we need is continuity in the police department and the chief has made tremendous relationships with a number of protesters and so I think that’s what those protesters want,” Knowles said. “The conversations we have been able to have with people have been very productive. ... We need to have a mutual understanding before we can move forward.”",3575

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)

Last week, as protesters gathered in Ferguson, Mo., police discovered a man’s body in a white Pontiac parked not far from where an unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by a police officer in August.

The man was 20-year-old Deandre Joshua. His body — found the morning after a grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson — had been burned.

But did his death have any connection to the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown or the unrest that followed in this St. Louis suburb?

The timing and brutal nature of Joshua’s death — his partially burned body was found with a bullet in the head — spurred speculation that it might be connected to protests that occurred after St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch’s announcement of the grand jury’s decision on Nov. 24. On Internet message boards, some suggested that Joshua was a grand jury witness and wondered whether his death was in retaliation.

After all, just up the street, more than 60 shell casings were found in the parking lot of a BBQ restaurant. Around the corner, someone spray-painted the phrase “snitches get stitches” on the side of a building.

According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn’t have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch’s office — which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation — this week confirmed that Joshua didn’t offer testimony during the proceedings.

“He was not a witness,” said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.

Joshua grew up not far from Ferguson, one of four children in his family. He had an identical twin and a job at a local Walmart. He had recently started dating a woman who lived near where his body was found.

“He loved being with family,” said Diamonique James, Joshua’s cousin, who saw him Nov. 23 in Ferguson. “He was the life of the party.”

Family members told the New York Times that Joshua had considered joining the military or applying to community college but had decided to stick with his gig at Walmart, working the night shift. Joshua was also a close friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown on the day of the shooting.

“It’s tragic. He was a good kid,” Johnson said on MSNBC after his death. “It’s a tragedy what happened to him.”

His relationship with Johnson, some close to his family noted, underscore how off-base the rumors about Joshua were. What are the chances that Johnson’s childhood friend, who didn’t live nearby, would happen to be on that street on that day? And if he was, why didn’t Johnson say anything to his attorneys or investigators about it?

“Dorian has known this guy since kindergarten,” said Adolphus Pruitt, a local NAACP president who helped Johnson locate witnesses after the Brown shooting. “If this guy had been around and saw anything, Dorian would have told us.”

Some have floated theories about Joshua’s death that aren’t connected to the Brown shooting. (The investigation remains active and ongoing.) Perhaps it was a robbery attempt gone awry, or a set-up. After the body was discovered, one Ferguson resident told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he had spotted four armed men the night prior discussing killing someone.

“I knew it was going to be true,” Richard Taylor told the local paper last week. “When I got up this morning, I saw this.”",3560

Eagles guitarist Glenn Frey has died at the age of 67, the band has announced.

He died in New York City on Monday from complications arising from rheumatoid arthritis, colitis and pneumonia.

""Words can neither describe our sorrow, nor our love and respect for all that he has given to us,"" his family and fellow band members said.

The Eagles were one of the most successful bands of the 1970s, with multiple hit singles, including Hotel California in 1976.

Frey co-founded the Eagles in 1971 with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hotel California was one of the band's biggest hits

He co-wrote Hotel California with Henley and Don Felder, and composed a number of the band's biggest songs on his own, including Heartache Tonight and Lyin' Eyes.

The Eagles notched up more than 150 million album sales worldwide, with Hotel California and their greatest hits among the best selling in history.

Tributes have been paid on social media, with country star Tim McGraw writing: ""His music was personally inspirational, his impact immeasurable, his legacy timeless. #glennfrey #heartachetonight""

Paul Stanley from Kiss added: ""SHOCKED to report the death of GLENN FREY. Eagle & brilliant songwriter.""

Singer Ryan Adams wrote: ""RIP, Glenn Frey. Travel to the stars safely, bro"", while Huey Lewis called him "" a really good guy. Talented, funny, cynical and sweet"".

Flawless harmonies: Mark Savage, Music reporter

The Eagles were one of the great forces of 1970s rock. They may not have had the dynamics of Led Zeppelin or the drama of Fleetwood Mac, but they dominated the airwaves. AM radio would play the hits, filled with flawless harmonies, while FM stations would spin the longer, unedited album cuts.

Frey emerged as one of the band's chief songwriters, the Lennon to Don Henley's McCartney. He penned their breakout hit Take It Easy - a song as laid back as its title suggests - with Jackson Browne. But later singles, including Take It To The Limit and Hotel California, were group efforts, while the two front men would share vocal duties - Frey's supple tones a perfect counterpoint to Henley's rasp.

In the US, they scored five number one singles and four number one albums; while their greatest hits sold 30 million copies.

""It boggles the mind somewhat,"" Frey told Rolling Stone in 2012. ""But as long as I keep taking out the garbage and cleaning up after the dogs and taking the kids to school, I'll have perspective.""

Nonetheless, success took its toll on the band. Frey used to describe their break-up in two words - ""Hotel California"" - explaining that the pressure of following up that record tore the band apart.

In 1980, Henley famously said the Eagles would reform ""when hell freezes over"". Fourteen years later, that became the title of the band's comeback album, as the old friends made amends.

""He was like a brother to me; we were family, and like most families, there was some dysfunction,"" Henley said in a statement.

""But, the bond we forged 45 years ago was never broken, even during the 14 years that the Eagles were dissolved.""

After the Eagles' acrimonious split in 1980, Frey enjoyed success as a solo artist, most notably with The Heat is On, recorded for the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop.

The band reunited in 1994 and became a hugely popular touring act.",3538

She rushed to a police outpost near her home upon hearing gunfire, before her adrenalin took over and she “began to shoot back.”

The incident happened early in the morning on November 17 in the Balabolok district, in the Farah province of western Afghanistan, near the border with Iran.

""It was around 5am when my son's check post came under the attack of Taliban,"" the mother, Reza Gul, told Afghan television network, TOLOnews. ""When the fighting intensified, I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon, went to the check post and began shooting back.""

Her maternal instincts took over after seeing her son Safiullah lying dead in front of her eyes, after a gun battle with the Taliban. However, she was not acting alone: a number of family members, including her husband, daughter and youngest son, rushed along to help and provided her with ammunition.

""The fighting intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons,"" said Reza Gul’s daughter-in-law, Seema, according to TOLOnews. ""We were committed to fight until the last bullet."" She added that the intense fighting lasted a number of hours, with 25 militants left dead and others wounded.

Reza Gul’s daughter Fatima says, “We started a kind of family war against the Taliban.” She added that she helped to prepare bullets for her mother and father to fight off the militant organization. Reza Gul’s husband Abdul Satar said they were prepared to sacrifice the whole family to ensure that the Taliban would not encroach on their lands.

""My young son who was a police officer was killed in front of my eyes,"" Abdul Satar said, as reported by TOLOnews. ""I pulled aside his dead body and started fighting to defend my soil to prove that this is the soil of Malalai, the hero. I was committed to give up my life, but not my son's check post.""

He was referring to Malalai of Maiwand, an Afghan folk hero who allegedly helped to defeat the British in the second Anglo-Afghan war in 1880.

The provincial police chief, General Abdul Razaq Yagubi, confirmed that the Taliban had launched an attack on Balabolok district on November 17. He also added that they came with an estimated 400 fighters to try and take the area.

Safiullah was the head of the local police post and had 10 other policemen under his control. However their post was shelled by Taliban militants and Safiullah was killed in the resulting firefight. His mother's presence “boosted the morale of policemen resisting the attack, and after seven hours of heavy fighting, the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were killed and 31 injured in that village alone,” Yagubi added, NBC reported.

It appears Raza Gul’s actions could go down in folklore and she could well become the new Malalai of Maiwand.

""We are proud of the bravery of this family and this is a saga that will be remembered for long by police and residents of Farah province,"" Yagubi added.

Afghans are fiercely loyal to their homes and these sentiments were confirmed by the family’s youngest son, Sardar, who has a word of warning for the Taliban if they ever think of returning.

""The Taliban are foreigners, they are servants of Pakistan, if they attack 100 other times, I will continue to defend my country and will shed their blood to not let them dare to enter my village,” said Sardar, who also helped to prepare bullets for his mother and father, according to TOLOnews.",3533

#Bravo http://t.co/A1vUQVx1ZR v  @sydrza",http://on.rt.com/q5zml7,True,Mother’s revenge: Afghan woman 'kills 25 Taliban' after son shot dead,"An Afghan mother, enraged by the Taliban’s fatal shooting of her policeman son, has allegedly helped to kill 25 militants. She rushed to a police outpost near her home upon hearing gunfire, before her adrenalin took over and she “began to shoot back.”

The incident happened early in the morning on November 17 in the Balabolok district, in the Farah province of western Afghanistan, near the border with Iran.

""It was around 5am when my son's check post came under the attack of Taliban,"" the mother, Reza Gul, told Afghan television network, TOLOnews. ""When the fighting intensified, I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon, went to the check post and began shooting back.""

Her maternal instincts took over after seeing her son Safiullah lying dead in front of her eyes, after a gun battle with the Taliban. However, she was not acting alone: a number of family members, including her husband, daughter and youngest son, rushed along to help and provided her with ammunition.

""The fighting intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons,"" said Reza Gul’s daughter-in-law, Seema, according to TOLOnews. ""We were committed to fight until the last bullet."" She added that the intense fighting lasted a number of hours, with 25 militants left dead and others wounded.

Reza Gul’s daughter Fatima says, “We started a kind of family war against the Taliban.” She added that she helped to prepare bullets for her mother and father to fight off the militant organization. Reza Gul’s husband Abdul Satar said they were prepared to sacrifice the whole family to ensure that the Taliban would not encroach on their lands.

""My young son who was a police officer was killed in front of my eyes,"" Abdul Satar said, as reported by TOLOnews. ""I pulled aside his dead body and started fighting to defend my soil to prove that this is the soil of Malalai, the hero. I was committed to give up my life, but not my son's check post.""

He was referring to Malalai of Maiwand, an Afghan folk hero who allegedly helped to defeat the British in the second Anglo-Afghan war in 1880.

The provincial police chief, General Abdul Razaq Yagubi, confirmed that the Taliban had launched an attack on Balabolok district on November 17. He also added that they came with an estimated 400 fighters to try and take the area.

Safiullah was the head of the local police post and had 10 other policemen under his control. However their post was shelled by Taliban militants and Safiullah was killed in the resulting firefight. His mother's presence “boosted the morale of policemen resisting the attack, and after seven hours of heavy fighting, the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were killed and 31 injured in that village alone,” Yagubi added, NBC reported.

It appears Raza Gul’s actions could go down in folklore and she could well become the new Malalai of Maiwand.

""We are proud of the bravery of this family and this is a saga that will be remembered for long by police and residents of Farah province,"" Yagubi added.

Afghans are fiercely loyal to their homes and these sentiments were confirmed by the family’s youngest son, Sardar, who has a word of warning for the Taliban if they ever think of returning.

""The Taliban are foreigners, they are servants of Pakistan, if they attack 100 other times, I will continue to defend my country and will shed their blood to not let them dare to enter my village,” said Sardar, who also helped to prepare bullets for his mother and father, according to TOLOnews.",3533

1. Heart disease
2. Cancer
3. Medical error

https://t.co/F6f182uN8E https://t.co/qQtv3Vq3lK",http://onforb.es/1Oh7wh1,True,"Medical Error Is A Leading Cause Of Death, But You Won't See It On The CDC's List","If someone trips and accidentally disconnects a ventilator power cord and the patient dies, the cause listed on the death certificate is likely to be respiratory failure. It's not that anyone necessarily is trying to hide the fact that a mistake was made. It's that ""medical error"" isn't even an option on death certificates.

And that, Dr. Martin Makary says, is a mistake. While tripping on ventilator cords rarely happens in the United States, medical errors are plentiful, according to a new analysis by Makary, a cancer surgeon and professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Michael Daniel, a Hopkins medical student.

Makary and Daniel cite several definitions of medical error from the scientific literature:

""An unintended act (either of omission or commission) or one that does not achieve its intended outcome.""

""The failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (an error of execution).""

""The use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (an error of planning).""

""A deviation from the process of care that may or may not cause harm to the patient.""

They estimate that more than a quarter of a million U.S. hospital patients die each year as a result of a medical error, making it the third leading cause of death, behind only heart disease and cancer. But, Makary told me, ""in generating our national health statistics, these problems are not even showing up.""

Makary and Daniel's estimate is far higher than the 44,000 to 98,000 annual hospital deaths from medical errors estimated in a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). But it's lower than the more than 400,000 deaths estimated in a 2013 article by John James, a Texas man who created Patient Safety America after, he says, his 19-year-old son died in 2002 ""as a result of uninformed, careless and unethical care by cardiologists at a hospital.""

In their paper, published in the BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, Makary and Daniel call the IOM estimate ""limited and outdated."" In an email to me, James noted that Makary and Daniel based their estimate on three of the four studies he had used but used ""different assumptions to arrive at a substantially different number. In the text of that paper, the authors admit that many errors are going to go uncounted with their approach. I dealt with those uncertainties in my paper, although, as you well know, exact counts are elusive at this point.""

Pretty much everyone who's studied medical errors would agree with James' last observation. The problem, Makary and Daniel conclude in their paper, is that in the United States, as in 116 other countries, death certificates rely on assigning an International Classification of Disease (ICD) code to the cause of death. The first ICD codes were developed more than a century ago. You've likely seen them on paperwork at your doctor's office, which uses ICD codes in medical records and reimbursement claims.

""The system that we have now is not designed for today,"" Makary told me. ""Billing codes were never meant for national health statistics. People just don't die of billing codes. People just don't die of bacteria and hardened arteries."" They die from communication breakdowns and diagnostic errors as well, causes that are not an option on death certificates, he said.

Makary and Daniel and two other Hopkins medical students wrote an appeal Sunday to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, urging that the agency change the way it collects death statistics.",3508

Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said earlier that five people had been killed, but this was later corrected.

Witnesses at the school described screaming and more than half a dozen shots.

Kevin Janvier, acting mayor of La Loche, said that his 23-year-old daughter Marie, a teacher, was one of the victims at the school.

He also said police had told him that the gunman first shot two of his siblings at home and then made his way to the school.

Canada's gun laws

To buy a gun or ammunition, Canadians must have a licence under the Firearms Act, which requires a safety course, a waiting period and background checks

There are three classifications of guns: non-restricted - shotguns and rifles, commonly used for hunting; restricted - certain handguns and some semi-automatic long guns; and prohibited - most handguns, fully automatic firearms, converted automatics, firearms with a sawed-off barrel, and some military rifles like the AK-47

In 2012, the government of Canada ended the Long Gun Registry, a database linking guns with their respective owners - this means gun owners no longer have to register non-restricted or non-prohibited guns

Canada's gun-related homicide rate (0.5 per 100,000) is about seven times lower than the United States' (3.5 per 100,000). However, Canada's gun-related murder rate is higher than many of its peers, including Japan (0.01 per 100,000) and the United Kingdom (0.06 per 100,000)

Gun-related crime is highest in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which also report the highest rates of non-gun-related violent crime

'Shock and sorrow'

At a news conference, Maureen Levy, a senior officer at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), said: ""There's no risk to public safety at this time. This is truly a tragedy.""

She provided no further details.

The RCMP said officers were called about ""an active shooter"" at 13:00 local time (19:00 GMT) and detained the suspect 45 minutes later, Canada's CBC broadcaster reports.

""Words cannot express my shock and sorrow at the horrific events today in La Loche,"" Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said in a statement.

""My thoughts and prayers are with all the victims, their families and friends and all the people of the community.""

About 900 students attend La Loche Community School for kindergarten through to grade 12 (the last year of high school).

""I ran outside the school,"" Noel Desjarlais, a Grade 10 student, told CBC.

A Maoist cult leader who committed a string of sex assaults and kept his daughter captive in London for three decades has been jailed for 23 years.

Aravindan Balakrishnan, 75, of Enfield, called himself Comrade Bala and brainwashed his cult into thinking he had god-like powers.

Over 30 years he also raped two of his followers, Southwark Crown Court heard.

His daughter Katy Morgan-Davies said the situation was ""horrible, so dehumanising and degrading"".

Ms Morgan-Davies, 33, who has waived her right to anonymity, said: ""I felt like a caged bird with clipped wings.""

Balakrishnan was convicted of offences including child cruelty, false imprisonment and assault.

The court heard he established the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in the 1970s in south London and convinced his followers into thinking he could read their minds.

He warned them a supernatural force called Jackie would cause natural disasters if he was ever disobeyed.

Branding him a ""narcissist and a psychopath"", his daughter said: ""The people he looked up to were people like Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein - you couldn't criticise them either in the house.

""They were his gods and his heroes. These were the sort of people he wanted to emulate.""

During the trial she told the court she was beaten and banned from singing nursery rhymes, going to school or making friends.

And she said her father was using the sect as a ""pilot unit"" to learn how to control people before taking over the world.

She said: ""I used to think 'God, if the whole world is going to be like this, what way out is there? How am I going to live? I cannot live in this.

""So I used to think that the best way would be to die.""

Told she was a ""waif"", it was only when she was a teenager that she learned a follower of Balakrishnan, Sian Davies, then known as Comrade Sian, was her mother.

Ms Davies, a GP's daughter from Ceredigion, Wales, fell from a window at the cult's base on Christmas Eve in 1996 and died several months later in hospital

Ms Morgan-Davies said that night she heard screaming and shouting and saw her mother lying in a pool of blood below the bathroom window pleading with Balakrishnan to ""kill me"".

She said in the subsequent years she would dream of her mother and wake up crying.

Sentencing Balakrishnan, the judge said: ""You decided to treat her as a project, not a person.

""You claimed to do it for her to protect her from the outside world, but you created a cruel environment.""

Ms Morgan-Davies managed to escape the cult in 2013 after memorising the number for an anti-slavery charity she saw on the news.

She has since moved to Leeds and started an education and said: ""I've been a non-person all my life and now is my chance to be myself.""

During sentencing the judge recommended that £500 be given to the Palm Cove Society, which helped Balakrishnan's daughter escape.",3459

The Islamic State group's propaganda magazine has confirmed the British militant known as Jihadi John died in a drone strike in November.

The group published an obituary for the jihadist, whose real name was Mohammed Emwazi, in its online magazine Dabiq.

In November the US military said it was ""reasonably certain"" it had killed him in the IS-stronghold of Raqqa.

Emwazi appeared in beheading videos of victims including UK aid worker David Haines and taxi driver Alan Henning.

Who was Mohammed Emwazi?

In the eulogy, Kuwaiti-born Emwazi is referred to as Abu Muharib al-Muhajir, his nickname in the group and the details of his death confirm the US version of events.

The jihadist group said Emwazi was killed on 12 November ""as the car he was in was targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of Raqqa, destroying the car and killing him instantly"".

A smiling picture of the militant, who appears unmasked looking towards the ground, accompanies the text, which is written in tribute form to a man they describe as an ""honourable brother"".

Image caption Clockwise from top left: Abdul-Rahman Kassig, Steven Sotloff, James Foley, Kenji Goto, David Haines, Alan Henning

Emwazi first emerged in August 2014 when he appeared masked in a video in which US journalist James Foley was apparently murdered.

Dubbed Jihadi John by the media, in February 2015 he was identified as Emwazi, a computer programming graduate who grew up in London.

He also appeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, Mr Haines, Mr Henning, as well as American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter, and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto.

He became a top target for US and British intelligence agencies, even though he is thought to have played no military role within IS.

At the time of his reported death in November, Prime Minister David Cameron said targeting Emwazi had been ""the right thing to do"".

He said the UK had been working with its US allies ""literally around the clock"" to track Emwazi down.

Three drones - one British and two American - were involved in the strike. One of the American drones hit the car, and it is believed there was one other person in the vehicle.

They are now being questioned by federal authorities

This is the second incident in which Afghan soldiers went missing in the United States

Three Afghan National Army officers -- guests of the U.S. military at a training exercise in Massachusetts -- disappeared on Saturday and reappeared Monday in the custody of Canadian border guards.

The men are in custody at the Rainbow Bridge, a checkpoint on the border at Niagara Falls, and are being interviewed by federal authorities, Massachusetts State Police David Procopio said.

The military, State Department and other government agencies are remaining especially quiet about the choice the three Afghan officers made to go off the radar.

Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar went missing Saturday after a trip to a mall. The three were reported missing by base security late Saturday and were last seen at a Cape Cod mall in Hyannis.

Authorities said they posed no threat to the public.

Shelbe Benson-Fuller, regional press officer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency was notified by the Canadian Border Services Agency when the men were taken into custody.

Canadian officials declined to confirm if the three officers were seeking asylum.

Arash, Askarzada and Aminyar arrived in the United States on September 11 for the annual Exercise Regional Cooperation and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod, the Massachusetts National Guard said.

Their disappearance comes in the wake of an incident earlier this month when two Afghan police officers training with the DEA went missing for six days.

Mohd Naweed Samimi, 24, and Mohammad Yasin Ataye, 22, were training in Quantico, Virginia, and went missing on September 13. They were later found on September 18 in Buffalo, New York, according to DEA spokesman Rusty Payne.

The men, who Payne said were monitored by escorts at all times, never posed any threat or danger. They wanted to stay in the United States, but authorities found them and sent them home.

In both cases, the Afghan attendees at the training sessions were cleared and given visas by the State Department.

A source familiar with the process told CNN that officers are usually handpicked and vetted, including a complete background check, possible polygraph and interviews to determine whether they are a flight risk.

The source says that the three officers did not break the law.

The Massachusetts State Police concurred.

The Exercise Regional Cooperation, in which the three soldiers training in Cape Cod were participating, included troops from six nations. Despite their disappearance, the guard said the exercise has continued.

The purpose of the exercise is to train participating nations in ""stability operations"" and ""operations conducted during United Nations mandated peacekeeping operations,"" according to the guard.

Roughly a dozen Afghan soldiers are still participating.

The Regional Cooperation exercise has been conducted annually since 2004, according to the Massachusetts National Guard. Tajikistan is the lead nation for conducting the exercise this year. The last exercise was held in 2013 and led by the Republic of Kazakhstan's Ministry of Defense.

Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, told CNN that the ministry is investigating both incidents.",3431

Marriages Edit

Women's Rights Activism and Run for the Presidency Edit

A free thinker, Victoria Woodhull created Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly, a radical publication, in 1870 with her sister, Tennessee. The publication gave the sisters a place to express their ideas on social reforms, including women's suffrage, birth control and free love. The journal also published the first English translation of Karl Marx's The Communist Manifesto.

Careers Edit

Life in England and third marriage Edit

In October 1876, Woodhull divorced her second husband, Colonel Blood. Less than a year later, exhausted and possibly depressed, she left to start a new life. When Commodore Vanderbilt died, his son William Henry Vanderbilt gave Victoria and Tennessee a large sum of money to leave the country and set up in England. She made her first public appearance as a lecturer at St. James's Hall in London on December 4, 1877. Her lecture was called The Human Body, the Temple of God, a lecture which she had previously presented in the United States. Present at one of her lectures was the banker John Biddulph Martin. They began to see each other and married on October 31, 1883. His family disapproved of the union, but eventually gave in. From then on, she was known as Victoria Woodhull Martin. Under that name, she published the magazine, The Humanitarian, from 1892 to 1901, with help from her daughter Zula Woodhull. After her husband died in 1901, Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country, establishing residence at Bredon's Norton's, where she built a village school with Tennessee and Zula. Through her work at Bredon's Norton's school, she became a champion for education reform in English village schools with the addition of kindergarten curriculum.[48]

Views on abortion and eugenics Edit

Her opposition to abortion is frequently cited by opponents of abortion when writing about first wave feminism. The most common Woodhull quotations cited by opponents of abortion are: “the rights of children as individuals begin while yet they remain the foetus”[49][50] “Every woman knows that if she were free, she would never bear an unwished-for child, nor think of murdering one before its birth.[51] Woodhull also promoted eugenics which was popular in the early 20th century prior to World War II. Her interest in eugenics might have been motivated by the profound intellectual impairment of her son. She advocated, among other things, sex education, ""marrying well,"" and pre-natal care as a way to bear healthier children and to prevent mental and physical disease. Her writings demonstrate views closer to those of the anarchist eugenists, rather than the coercive eugenists like Sir Francis Galton. In 2006, publisher Michael W. Perry claimed in his book ""Lady Eugenist"" that Woodhull supported the forcible sterilization of those she considered unfit to breed. He based his claim on a New York Times article from 1927 in which she concurred with the ruling of the case Buck v. Bell. If this article accurately states her views, it would stand in stark contrast to her earlier works in which she advocated social freedom and opposed government interference in matters of love and marriage. Woodhull-Martin died on June 9, 1927 at Norton Park in Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire.[52]

Leelah Alcorn, a 17-year-old transgender woman, will break your heart.

Local Kings Mill, Ohio news outlets initially reported the death of 17-year-old Joshua Alcorn, Leelah's birth name. She was hit by a semitruck while walking on I-71 around 2:00 a.m. Sunday (December 28) morning. She was pronounced dead on the scene, and police are investigating the circumstances of her death.

When you look at the bigger picture of Leelah's life through social media, the circumstances seem much more clear than a teen taking a walk. The Tumblr post that Leelah scheduled for after her time of death, constituting her suicide note and final wishes, is gut-wrenching.

On the page where she describes herself as ""the transgender queen of hell <3<3<3,"" Leelah left a post detailing her coming out to her Christian parents as transgender and their negative reaction. She eventually was pulled out of school and forbidden from using social media after coming out to her peers as gay. Even when her parents allowed her back on social media, Leelah says she felt lonely and like she had no friends.

""I have decided I’ve had enough,"" she wrote in the post. ""I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say 'it gets better' but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.""

She requested that her possessions be sold and the proceeds, as well as the contents of her bank account, be donated to ""trans civil rights movements and support groups.""

""My death needs to mean something,"" she wrote. ""My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that’s f--ked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.""

In a separate post scheduled immediately after her suicide note and entitled ""Sorry,"" Leelah apologizes to her siblings and various friends. ""Please don't be sad,"" she writes to her younger sister.

Her words for her parents, however, were straightforward: ""Mom and Dad: F--k you. You can’t just control other people like that. That’s messed up.""

Considering her mother's Facebook post, announcing that her ""sweet 16 year old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn went home to heaven this morning"" after an ""early morning walk,"" Leelah's wishes don't appear to have been taken to heart yet.

(Note: All news reports, as well as Leelah's Tumblr, list her age as 17.)

For those still wishing to refer to Leelah as male, she also had a final message in her ""Sorry"" Tumblr post.

""Also, anyone who says something like 'I wish I got to know him better' or 'I wish I treated him better' gets a punch in the nose.""

If you are transgender and thinking about suicide, or know someone who is, please contact the Trans Lifeline at (877) 565-8860.

Late Thursday night, roughly 75 people a minute were adding their name to the petition as it clicked over 1 million, just after 10:30 pm Eastern Time.

“That’s a million families who are going to spread the word about Target, so they may not get those customers back,” or their money, said Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, which has hosted the boycott.

Target’s “management is just going to have step up here [and] say ‘We’re selling hammers and hats, we’re not into social engineering,'” he said.

The boycott was announced April 20 by the association, one day after Target revealed its decision to favor its few transgender customers and staff over the rest of the population. A study of the 2010 census data suggests that only about 1 in 2,400 adults change their names to match names used by the other sex.

Wildmon’s association wants to affirm people’s privacy in bathrooms and changing rooms, but also to block the progressives’ multi-front push to stigmatize and outlaw any recognition of the average differences between women and men, and between boys and girls. The LGBT agenda “is being rammed down people’s throats, and people are losing their jobs because of it, and it is becoming so that you can’t think differently from these people or you’re [called] a hater or a bigot,” he said.

Since the decision was announced, numerous comments, articles, and videos protesting the store’s one-sided decision have gone viral. Public opinion has moved and hardened in opposition to the previously bizarre notion of dual-sex bathrooms and changing rooms, and Target’s brand as a family friendly store has taken a hit, as the online conversation shifted from its claim of “cheap chic” to worries of privacy, sexual predators, and the anger at the company’s disregard for the reasoned judgement of its middle-class customers.

“This is how people can fight back — they’re not going to shop at Target,” said Wildmon.

Speaking at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the Pope made comments which experts said put an end to the “pseudo theories” of creationism and intelligent design that some argue were encouraged by his predecessor, Benedict XVI.

Francis explained that both scientific theories were not incompatible with the existence of a creator – arguing instead that they “require it”.

“When we read about Creation in Genesis, we run the risk of imagining God was a magician, with a magic wand able to do everything. But that is not so,” Francis said.

“The Big Bang, which today we hold to be the origin of the world, does not contradict the intervention of the divine creator but, rather, requires it.

“Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.”

The Catholic Church has long had a reputation for being anti-science – most famously when Galileo faced the inquisition and was forced to retract his “heretic” theory that the Earth revolved around the Sun.

But Pope Francis’s comments were more in keeping with the progressive work of Pope Pius XII, who opened the door to the idea of evolution and actively welcomed the Big Bang theory. In 1996, John Paul II went further and suggested evolution was “more than a hypothesis” and “effectively proven fact”.

Yet more recently, Benedict XVI and his close advisors have apparently endorsed the idea that intelligent design underpins evolution – the idea that natural selection on its own is insufficient to explain the complexity of the world. In 2005, his close associate Cardinal Schoenborn wrote an article saying “evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense – an unguided, unplanned process – is not”.

Giovanni Bignami, a professor and president of Italy’s National Institute for Astrophysics, told the Italian news agency Adnkronos: “The pope’s statement is significant. We are the direct descendents from the Big Bang that created the universe. Evolution came from creation.”

Giulio Giorello, professor of the philosophy of science at Milan’s University degli Studi, told reporters that he believed Francis was “trying to reduce the emotion of dispute or presumed disputes” with science.

Despite the huge gulf in theological stance between his tenure and that of his predecessor, Francis praised Benedict XVI as he unveiled a bronze bust of him at the academy's headquarters in the Vatican Gardens.

“No one could ever say of him that study and science made him and his love for God and his neighbour wither,” Francis said, according to a translation by the Catholic News Service.

“On the contrary, knowledge, wisdom and prayer enlarged his heart and his spirit. Let us thank God for the gift that he gave the church and the world with the existence and the pontificate of Pope Benedict.”",3357

“It’s been incredible,” Rios said. “We’ve had quite an outpouring. We have right now 1,137,000 families who signed on to the boycott.”

“Target stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,” said Rios. She and Bannon discussed reports that Target has lost as much as $2 billion in market capitalization as a result of the current decline.

According to additional reports Target had lost as much as $2.5 billion dollars in stock value during this period given their Friday numbers.

Target stock prices dropped in 10 days after the retailer announced a new policy to allow customers to use whichever bathroom or fitting room accords to their gender identity. On Friday, the shares of Target Corporation Common Stock (TGT) fell 2.52 percent in one day, according to recent reports. In addition since April 19th, the day they announced the new policy, the stock went from a share value of $84.14 to $79.27 per share. That’s a drop of 5.8 percent in 10 days. The Family Policy institute says they estimate that to be a loss to the company of $2.5 billion dollars.

“Target’s response is that they are standing by their policy. They want everyone to feel welcome, and their solution is that if women are uncomfortable with men coming into their bathrooms, they should use the family bathroom. So, rather than the 0.3 percent of the population that claim the transgender status, they want the women to use the family bathroom,” she added.

Continued Rios, “The chief concern, even more than the trauma for little girls of having men dressed like women coming in their bathrooms, the chief concern of the American Family Association is the predators who will take advantage … and we have a long list of predators who have done that.”

“This is not going to stop with Target if we don’t take a very strong stand now,” Rios said. “I would say on the positive side, we’ve had other corporations come to us privately and say they’re watching. They were considering changing their policies, but they’re watching this boycott and they’re saying, you know, maybe not. Maybe we’re not going to go in that direction. So, a lot hinges on it, and this is something simple that people can do. We are in dialogue with other companies, other corporations encouraging them not to do this. And of course if they do, we’ll have to apply the same thing that we applied to Target,” she concluded.

Rios also noted: “I don’t know if people realize that the Obama Education Department has been pushing this whole thing of breaking down the barriers in the bathrooms in public school now this whole year. They are actually threatening to withhold money from schools if schools do not accommodate children, boys and girls who think they are the other gender … that they can lost their funding. So, this has been a battle by school boards. There’s a huge one that went on in fairfax, Virginia, just this past year and they lost. The parents lost.”

Autograph reads: May everyday be wonderful for you! Blessings and Love, Donna Douglas, Elly May Prov. 3: 5&6 (Source: WAFB)

Family members say Donna Douglas passed away at the age of 82. Douglas was an actress, best known for her role as Elly May Clampett, the only daughter of Jed Clampett, in the CBS television series The Beverly Hillbillies. The series ran for nine years, ending in 1971.

Charlene Smith, Douglas' niece and former mayor of Zachary, says her aunt passed away Thursday, Jan. 1 in her Zachary, LA home, with family members by her side. She says pancreatic cancer was the cause of death and only learned she had cancer three months ago.

Douglas was born Doris Smith, near Pride, LA. Her family was poor, but they moved to north Baton Rouge when her father, Emmett Smith, got a job with Esso Oil Company.

She married at age 17 and a baby boy came along, but the marriage split. Her parents, Emmet and Elma Smith, kept their grandson while Donna moved to New York to try and make as much money as possible to send back home.

""I believed if I believed with all my heart that if I did the best I could do, that God would take care of me,"" said Douglas in a 2009 interview with WAFB. ""Then I didn't have to be afraid. And the other thing was that Mom and Daddy trusted me enough to let me go and was gonna help me with my little boy, because he was gonna stay. Then I was gonna be worth of their trust.""

Donna then moved to Los Angeles where she landed the coveted role of Elly May Clampett.

After her stint on, Douglas was every man's sexy pinup dream, but as producers for upcoming movies asked her to show more skin, play more provocative roles, she turned down movies.

Douglas also appeared in several other hit shows, including The Twilight Zone, Mister Ed and Route 66. She also co-starred with Elvis Presley in Frankie and Johnny.

""I didn't want to be put in a place of compromise. So I went to night school and got my real estate license,"" she said in the 2009 interview. She says she was not good in real estate because she learned she was a service person.

""I'll tell em what's good about the house, but I'll tell them what's wrong about it too. And you don't do that!""

For nearly 50 years, she appeared before hundreds of churches, schools, and organizations across the country, talking about God, telling her story of moral choices and the great times she's lived.

In 2011, Douglas sued toy manufacturer Mattel Inc., claiming the company used her name and likeness for a Barbie doll without authorization. The suit was settled.

Douglas attended St. Gerard High School, a Roman Catholic school now called Redemptorist High School, where she played softball and basketball. She was a member of the school's first graduating class.

She was a ""Miss Baton Rouge"" and was named ""Miss New Orleans"" in 1957.

When Douglas gave her autograph, she signed it with Proverbs 3: 5-6, which reads:

English Standard Version (ESV)

5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 6 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.

Donna's family asks that her funeral be private, and they'll make a statement Monday.

387309869080281088,false,It says a lot about your worldview that you hear Obama is donating a Muslim museum and it makes sense to you: http://t.co/n3C4XDYPfX,http://wapo.st/17gR1e2,True,‘Fox & Friends’ fails on Obama-Muslim museum connection: No surprise here,"In their glorious history, fake-news sites have thrived by fooling people into thinking their stuff is for real. For instance, the conservative congressman who fell for that classic Onion story on an “Abortionplex” opening up in Topeka, or the Chinese Communist Party newspaper that fell for the Onion story celebrating North Korea’s Kim Jong Un as the “sexiest man alive,” or the news sites, including Boston.com and Breitbart.com, that bought the Daily Currant’s story that New York Times columnist Paul Krugman had gone bankrupt.

The record shows that those hoodwinked by fake news generally swallow pieces that confirm their worldview or advance their agenda. So: If you’re out to get Fox News to bite on a fake-news story, one good way just might be to … concoct an article in which President Obama digs into his pocket to support the International Museum of Muslim Cultures. That’s the allegation that recently surfaced on the National Reporter, which calls itself an “online portal for ‘citizen journalists.'”

The story got some fame on the Saturday edition of Fox News’s morning program “Fox & Friends.” After a discussion of the dispute over the accessibility of the World War II Memorial during the government shutdown, co-host Anna Kooiman said, “We’re going to talk a little bit later in the show, too, about some things that are continuing to be funded and President Obama has offered to pay out of his own pocket for the Museum of Muslim Culture, out of his own pocket.”

Kooiman later tweeted:

Just met w producers- I made a mistake yday after receiving flawed research abt a museum possibly closing. My apologies. Won’t happen again. — Anna Kooiman (@annakooiman) October 6, 2013

Kooiman clearly wasn’t paying close attention to the Erik Wemple Blog in early July, when we discussed a story in the National Report about alleging that President Obama had said some out-there things on a trip to Africa:

AP reporter Ramona Darlington, who attended the conference asked President Obama to explain what the profile of an American domestic terrorists is? Obama responded by saying, “Typically domestic terrorists in the U.S. are people who cling to obsolete beliefs from the time of the American Revolution. They are conservative Christians, reactionary Republicans and conspiracy theorists many of whom belong to racist hate groups.” “Tea Partiers commonly own guns and stock up ammunition and food in anticipation of starting another civil war to overthrow the will of the governing body who represent all of the American people. We are prepared for any contingency and don’t expect to see any kind of large insurrection. Americans are capitalists who are much more interested in seeing America move forward. These terrorists groups are small in size and really present little danger,” the President added.

The Associated Press told us that it employed no reporter named Ramona Darlington.

As for Kooiman’s pledge that this “won’t happen again,” we trust her: Never again will Kooiman allege on air that President Obama has paid from his own savings to prop up the Museum of Muslim Culture. A better bet, however, would be that Kooiman or another of her colleagues on the “Fox & Friends” couch will commit some other massive failure of fact and judgment, and soon.

We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity.

Dicaprio, giving an acceptance speech for the Crystal Award, shared his astonishment at seeing ancient glaciers rapidly disappearing while traveling making a new documentary on how the climate crisis is changing the natural balance of our planet. “We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system have denied–and even covered-up–the evidence of our changing climate. Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.”

DiCaprio announced that his grants will support projects that have expanded protected areas on land and at sea, protecting iconic endangered species and empowered indigenous communities to fight back against corporate encroachment on their lands for the past decade. The donations are divided up among a number of organizations: $6 million to Oceana and Skytruth for Global Fishing Watch; $1 million to the Nature Conservancy for its Seychelles debt-for-nature swap project; $3.2 million to Rainforest Action Network and Haka to protect the Sumatran rainforest, $3.4 million to Clearwater and the Ceibo Alliance in South America; and $1.5 million to the Solutions Project.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because DiCaprio also gave away $15 million last July. Since the creation of his foundation in 1998, DiCaprio has donated more than $30 million dollars to more than 65 organizations.

Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better.

DiCaprio has been making the most of his time on stages lately to speak out about those most vulnerable to climate change. At his speech at the Golden Globes last week he ended his speech with more warnings: “I want to share this award with all the first nations people represented in this film, and all of the indigenous communities around the world. It is time that we recognize your history and that we protect your indigenous lands from corporate interests and people that are out there to exploit them. It is time that we heard your voice and protected this planet for future generations.”

DiCaprio stated that we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and that the recent Paris Agreement at the climate talks this year, “…was an important first step, but we are a long way off from claiming victory in this fight for our future – for the survival of our planet. The Paris Agreement was a call to action, it is now up to all of us to build on this progress with ingenuity and a commitment to change. Together we are fighting to preserve our fragile climate from irreversible damage, and devastation of unthinkable proportions.”

A paedophile who filmed himself abusing young girls in the Philippines has been jailed for 19-and-a-half years.

Trevor Monk, 47, of south-east London, also paid nearly £15,000 to watch child sex abuse in Manila on his webcam.

Police found more than 80,000 images and 1,750 indecent videos of children in a raid on his home in March 2015.

He admitted possessing and making indecent images of children, assault of a child under 13 and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

'Depraved and revolting'

In total Monk pleaded guilty to 18 charges at the Old Bailey.

One of the girls he abused was eight years old and an image of a three-year-old child was discovered among the pictures.

Judge Anuja Dhir described the pictures as ""harrowing images of very young children being abused and degraded in the most vile manner"".

She said: ""Your actions were depraved and revolting. It is astonishing that anyone would want to film such abuse, but you did.

""I have no doubt you did so so that you could watch it again for your own sexual gratification.""

The growing problem of 'abuse to order'

The court heard Monk paid ""facilitators"" to watch live streams of abuse and for access to the children during a two-week holiday to the Far East in the spring of 2014.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested Monk as part of an investigation into UK nationals who pay to live-stream child abuse in the Philippines.

It was found he spent more than £14,000 to pay for what he called ""shows"" which he watched from his Erith home, before travelling to Manila to carry out the abuse himself.

Analysis

By BBC Correspondent Angus Crawford

The case of paedophile Trevor Monk represents a growing problem of British men ordering abuse over the internet.

Law enforcement is beginning to make inroads into the trade. Police in the Philippines carry out raids and arrests on a regular basis, but it's impossible to estimate accurately the scale of the problem.

Monk's case is significant because it shows that although his crimes began in the UK, using live streaming, that then led to him travelling to carry out contact abuse in the Philippines. The internet facilitated an escalation in his offending.

Most important though, is the fact that he got caught - thanks to co-operation between forces in the UK, US, Australia and the Philippines - which should send a powerful message to offenders that they cannot hide in the anonymity of the internet.

He was re-arrested in November when officers discovered a video of him sexually abusing a child during a trip to South East Asia.

Erica Hall, from aid charity World Vision UK, said: ""The widespread use of webcams coupled with dire economic conditions in many parts of the world means we're seeing many more cases of such vile abuse.

""It's encouraging that laws are keeping up with technology...[but] we suspect this is the tip of the iceberg with many cases still undetected.""

Following sentencing Kelvin Lay, senior investigating officer for the NCA, said it was a ""very important result"".",3304
551106923601219585,true,"Goodbye Elly May: 'Beverly Hillbillies' star Donna Douglas dead at 81, reports say. http://t.co/T1HFhuTnah http://t.co/03sO2YZKph",http://fxn.ws/1xBph7e,True,'Beverly Hillbillies' star Donna Douglas dead at 81,"Donna Douglas, the actress who won over TV viewers as Elly May Clampett on “The Beverly Hillbillies,” has died. She was 81.

The star’s granddaughter told TMZ Douglas died in her Louisiana home surrounded by friends and family.

The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, her niece told The Associated Press.

Douglas appeared “The Beverly Hillbillies,” a comedy about a backwoods Tennessee family who moved to Beverly Hills after striking it rich from oil on their land. for all nine seasons of the show and reprised her role in a TV movie reboot of the series in 1981.

As Elly May, she seemed blissfully unaware of her status as a bumpkin blond bombshell. Typically she was clad in a snug flannel shirt and tight jeans cinched with a rope belt, and she seemed to prefer her critters to any beau.

Chosen from more than 500 other actresses, Douglas said she felt at ease playing the role because, like her character, she grew up a poor Southern tomboy. Her childhood in Pride, Louisiana, came in handy when she was asked during her audition to milk a goat.

""I had milked cows before,"" she recalled in a 2009 interview with The Associated Press. ""I figured they were equipped the same, so I just went on over and did it.""

The show was not only assailed by critics, but by the network president who put it on the air: ""I HATED it,"" Michael Dann confided much later. ""After screening the pilot, I don't think I ever watched another segment.""

The public, however, felt quite the opposite: It ran for nine seasons, often in the Top 10. In their own way, the Clampetts were a forerunner of the `60s counterculture.

It wasn't much of a stretch for Douglas to fit into the troupe, said her cousin, Charlene Smith.

""She was always happy, and she really loved animals -- just like her character on `The Beverly Hillbillies.' She was a wonderful lady, a very good Christian lady.""

Indeed, when Douglas gave her autograph, she included a biblical verse (""Trust in the Lord with all your heart...""), according to New Orleans TV station WAFB.

Douglas' career began with beauty pageants -- she was Miss Baton Rouge and Miss New Orleans -- followed by a trip to New York to pursue a career in entertainment.

""That was the first time I had ever been on an airplane,"" Douglas said.

While modeling didn't appeal to her -- ""I didn't want to be that skinny"" -- television did. Douglas was featured as the Letters Girl on ""The Perry Como Show"" in 1957 and as the Billboard Girl on ""The Steve Allen Show"" in 1959.

Throughout the ‘50s and ‘60s the 1957 Miss New Orleans winner appeared in series like “The Twilight Zone” and “Mr. Ed.” In 1966, she transitioned to film with a role opposite Elvis Presley in the movie “Frankie and Johnny.”

After ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" Douglas worked in real estate, recorded country and gospel music albums and wrote a book for children that drew on biblical themes.

In 2010 she sued CBS and toymaker Mattel over a Barbie doll that used Elly May's name and likeness. The suit was settled in 2011.

She said she never minded being typecast as her ""Hillbillies"" character.

""So many kinds of people relate to Elly May,"" Douglas said. ""So many people love her, and that means a lot to me.""

A petition boycotting Target over its policy to allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice in its stores has gained nearly half a million signatures. (Photo: Damian Dovarganes, AP)

Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly referenced North Carolina's transgender bathroom law. It requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms associated with the sex on their birth certificate.

A conservative Christian activist group has gained more than half a million signatures and counting from people pledging to boycott Target over its transgender bathroom policy.

The petition started by the American Family Association on Wednesday raises concerns that Target's inclusive stance on transgender rights encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger, because ""a man can simply say he 'feels like a woman today' and enter the women's restroom.""

The boycott has more than 744,800 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon, marking it as one of AFA's most popular campaigns.

""This is the best response we’ve ever had this quick,"" says AFA President Tim Wildmon, attributing the protest's viral nature to the fact that ""everybody knows who Target is, and it’s an easy-to-understand issue.""

Wildmon says Target stands ""to lose a lot of customers who won't come back."" But Target is standing by its policy.

""We certainly respect that there are a wide variety of perspectives and opinions,"" says Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. ""As a company that firmly stands behind what it means to offer our team an inclusive place to work — and our guests an inclusive place to shop — we continue to believe that this is the right thing for Target.""

She added that hundreds of Target stores ""have single-stall, family restrooms for those who may be more comfortable with that option.""

CLOSE This marks the first time a federal appeals court has considered bathroom restrictions in light of Title IX, which could have national implications.Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Target made its position public in a blog post last week, stating that the company welcomes ""transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity."" The announcement comes as legislation on transgender issues in multiple states has spurred several major corporations and businesses to take a stance on LGBT rights.

Deutsche Bank halted a plan to add 250 jobs to an outpost of the company in North Carolina after the state passed a law requiring transgender people using public bathrooms to use the one associated with the sex on their birth certificate.

The American Family Association, a non-profit based in Tupelo, Miss., frequently protests on issues that target what it considers traditional family values. Its more recent campaigns include canceling the organization's use of PayPal after that company pulled back on plans to open a new facility in North Carolina due to the state's transgender bathroom law.

Al-Shabab militants have overrun an African Union military base outside the southern Somali town of el-Ade.

The Islamist group says it has taken ""complete control"" of the AU camp and killed more than 60 Kenyan soldiers.

Residents told the BBC that al-Shabab had raised its flag at a camp for Kenyan troops and said insurgents had paraded bodies through the town.

But Kenya's army spokesman said it was a nearby Somali base that was stormed and Kenyan troops counter-attacked.

The number of casualties on both sides was not known, Kenyan military spokesman Col David Obonyo said in a statement.

He told the BBC that reports of high Kenyan casualties were ""normal propaganda from al-Shabab"".

Kenya contributes more than 4,000 troops to the 22,000-strong AU force that is in Somalia helping the UN-backed government battle al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda.

An el-Ade resident told the BBC by phone that he had heard a loud explosion at about 05:30 local time (02:30 GMT), followed by heavy gunfire.

""We then saw an al-Shabab fighter in the town. We also saw Kenyan soldiers who were fleeing from the camp.

""At the moment the camp is in the hands of al-Shabab. We can see military cars burning and dead soldiers all over the place. There are no civilian casualties but most people have fled the town.""

Analysis: Tomi Oladipo, BBC Monitoring Africa security correspondent

Al-Shabab is keen to stress - both to the foreign forces in Somalia and would-be defectors within its ranks enamoured by so-called Islamic State - that it is a force to be reckoned with.

It is true that the group exaggerates the scale of its attacks but whether or not the death toll from el-Ade attack is as high as claimed, the African Union mission (Amisom) will have to recognise it still has a long way to go to gain full control of the country.

It says a lot for the insurgents to be daring enough to strike at the heart of an African Union base and engage troops in hours of combat.

They have done this before - in two major attacks targeting the Somali military last year, dozens of Burundian troops and Ugandans soldiers were killed.

Despite these setbacks, Amisom has achieved a lot recently by managing to push al-Shabab out of many parts of southern Somalia.

An al-Shabab official told the BBC that its fighters had attacked the base after morning prayers, starting with a car bomb before storming the facility.

""We took control of the base after one hour of fierce fighting,"" he said.

""We counted 63 Kenyan bodies inside the base. The other Kenyan troops have run away into the bush and we are hunting them down.""

He said the militants were confiscating 28 of 31 military vehicles inside the camp and all arms and ammunition.

The two military bases - one for Somali troops and the other for AU soldiers - neighbour each other on the outskirts of el-Ade, which is in Gedo region, about 380km (240 miles) west of Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab was ousted from the capital, Mogadishu, in August 2011, but still has a presence in large areas of southern Somalia and often stages attacks across the country.",3204

At the end of its two-day meeting Wednesday, the U.S. central bank acknowledged that the U.S. economy lost momentum at the end of 2015.

""Economic growth slowed late last year,"" the Fed's committee said in its statement, noting that the job market had improved.

U.S. stocks didn't react well to the Fed's statement. The Dow, which was up about 10 points before the release, dropped down 223 points points after the Fed's announcement.

In a widely expected decision, the Fed's committee also decided not to raise its key interest rate. Just a month ago, in December, the Fed raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade.

Despite its worries, the Fed stopped short of saying that the volatility in January will change its plans to raise rates at least four times for the rest of 2016. The committee noted that it's ""monitoring global economic and financial developments.""

It's worth remembering that after stocks tanked in late August, the Fed didn't raise rates in September. So far, the Fed hasn't indicated it is changing its mind.

The Fed's acknowledgment that the economy slowed down is a subtle sign that the committee might lower its rate hike expectations too, said Jason Pride, Director of Investment Strategy at Glenmede, a wealth management firm.

""They're publicly acknowledging that the growth rate is coming in slower than their expectations,"" said Pride.

Related: Wall Street is 'underestimating' the Fed

The fall in oil prices and uncertainty over China's economic slowdown remain major concerns across financial markets. Global currencies -- from Russia's ruble to China's yuan -- have tumbled, stoking fears of a global ""currency war"" where countries continuously devalue their currency to stay competitive with their exports.

The Dow and S&P 500 are down 8% and 7% so far this month, respectively.

Some experts argue that part of the turmoil stems from the Fed. Its committee, led by Chair Janet Yellen, estimated in December that it would raise interest rates about four times this year. Markets don't really believe that's possible: many investors believe the Fed will only raise rates twice this year.

Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer told CNBC in early January that ""the market is underestimating where we're going to be.""

But the stock market selloff has only worsened since he spoke and many on Wall Street doubt Fischer's claim.

Related: U.S. recession cries get louder

That disconnect -- and uncertainty -- between Fed expectations and the market's is adding to the stock market turmoil, some say.

""The Fed is getting a lot of criticism that their policy is what's causing this volatility,"" says Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""I just don't think you can get to four rate hikes this year at least under current conditions.""

Almost no one expected a rate hike Wednesday, but the Fed next meets in March and that will be the first test for those diverging expectations. If the Fed wants to do four rate hikes in 2016, it will probably need to start in March.

Right now, markets only believe there's a 38% chance of a March rate hike, according to CME Group.",3203

Islam bought himself a BMW but doesn’t have a license to drive it. And he rented a Manhattan apartment, though his parents, immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, won’t let him move out of the house yet.

Still, the cherubic prodigy is living, and dreaming, large.

“What makes the world go round?” Islam asked in the interview, explaining his preference for trading and investment over startups. “Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

Islam and a pair of other young, Wall Street wolf-cub buddies eat regularly at hot spot Morimoto, where they enjoy $400 caviar and fresh-squeezed apple juice.

They hope to start a hedge fund in June, after Islam turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license.

“Mo’s our maestro,” one of the kids explained.

The three pals intend to make a billion dollars by next year. All while attending college. “But it’s not just about the money,” Islam told the mag, which ranked his spectacular success story as No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.

“Like the Koch brothers,” he added, referring to sibling oil magnates Charles and David, worth $40 billion each.

Islam’s biggest inspiration, though, is Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge-funder and private asset manager from Connecticut who ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes.

Battered by losses, Jones would jump back in the game again and again. It was a lesson Islam found instructive when, while dabbling in penny stocks at age 9, he lost a chunk of the money he’d made tutoring. Islam swore off trading, realizing, “I didn’t have the balls for it,” he said.

We want to create a brotherhood … who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence. - Mohammed Islam

Fortunately, he turned to studying modern finance, reading up on the titans of trading and ultimately finding inspiration in Jones. “I had been paralyzed by my loss,” Islam remembered of his 9-year-old self.

“But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over,” he said.

And while Islam still needs to rely on Dad to chauffeur him on inspirational drives past the magnate’s Greenwich mansion, he’s quick to quote from the guru whom he credits with getting him back in the game and making him “who I am today.”

“Paul Tudor Jones says, ‘You learn more from your losses than from your gains.’ ”",3192

It was posted on a popular, though unverified, ""Banksy"" Instagram account without any attribution to the original artist. It quickly racked up more than 100,000 likes. We shared it, too.

But the illustration wasn't by Banksy, nor did it belong to the fake ""Banksy"" account. It was by Lucille Clerc, a London-based graphic designer, illustrator and printmaker — and it looks way better without a filter:

A photo posted by Lucille Clerc (@lucille_clerc) on Jan 1, 2015 at 2:12pm PST

Clerc, who shared it on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday night, wrote the caption: ""Break one, thousand will rise."" She added the hashtag #raiseyourpencilforfreedom.

On Thursday, Clerc told us that she wasn't upset about the confusion. She wrote:

This is irrelevant, I don’t want it to turn into polemic and distract people from the real issues. There are way more important things to talk about at the moment, and in the end what matters is that this image speaks to people, so the more it spreads the better it is. I am French and a woman and I was lucky enough to grow up in a free country. I never had to fight for my freedom of speech or opinion, neither for my right to be educated. This is my treasure, this is our most precious treasure. I believe in these values and so many people do just as much. I am truly devastated and all my thoughts are for the victims and their families, there are no words to express how much they will be missed. My drawing was a spontaneous reaction, I didn’t expect it would have such an echo. Ideas don’t break, ideas don’t die. Charlie became immortal yesterday and I hope that this terrible day will make us cherish and protect our freedom with even more wit and humour. I can only hope it will inspire people to use their pencils too and that there will be thousands of drawings like this very soon.

About the attack

Twelve people were killed in what France's president called a ""terror attack"" on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, leading authorities to launch a massive manhunt for the gunmen, two of whom remain at large.

The gunmen, caught on tape by an eyewitness, shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" as they walked outside the building carrying large guns and dressed entirely in black. The magazine staff was in an editorial meeting, around lunchtime in Paris, when the gunmen opened fire. Eleven others were wounded; four of those injuries are serious.

Witnesses described the gunmen as speaking perfect French.

Charlie Hebdo has frequently drawn condemnation from Muslims. In 2011, the magazine was firebombed after it ran a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muḥammad.

The editor in charge of the paper was one of those killed on Wednesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, though supporters of militant groups like the Islamic State and al-Qaeda praised the attack online. World leaders condemned it as an attack on freedom of expression.

688520025754304512,non-rumor,"Thanks to the #IranDeal, Iran's four pathways to a nuclear weapon have been blocked → https://t.co/3PJ1t0Zk7U https://t.co/IvvB4INuRm",http://go.wh.gov/IranDeal,True,The Historic Deal that Will Prevent Iran from Acquiring a Nuclear Weapon,"Building a nuclear bomb requires either uranium or plutonium, but thanks to this deal, Iran’s four possible ways to leverage those fissile materials are blocked.

Currently, Iran has a uranium stockpile to create 8 to ten nuclear bombs. But thanks to this nuclear deal, Iran must reduce its stockpile of uranium by 98%, and will keep its level of uranium enrichment at 3.67% — significantly below the enrichment level needed to create a bomb.

Let's look into Uranium: Iran would need two key elements to construct a uranium bomb: enough highly enriched uranium to produce enough material to construct a uranium bomb and tens of thousands of centrifuges.

Iran also needs tens of thousands of centrifuges to create highly enriched uranium for a bomb. Right now, Iran has nearly 20,000 centrifuges between their Natanz and Fordow uranium enrichment facilities. But under this deal, Iran must reduce its centrifuges to 6,104 for the next ten years. No enrichment will be allowed at the Fordow facility at all, and the only centrifuges Iran will be allowed to use are their oldest and least efficient models.

In short, here’s the difference this historic deal will make:

Let's look into Plutonium:

The third way Iran could build a nuclear weapon is by using weapons-grade plutonium. The only site where Iran could accomplish this is the Arak reactor, a heavy-water nuclear reactor. Right now, this reactor could be used in a weapons program, but under this deal, the Arak reactor will be redesigned so it cannot produce any weapons-grade plutonium. And all the spent fuel rods (which could also be source material for weapons-grade plutonium) will be sent out of the country as long as this reactor exists. What’s more, Iran will not be able to build a single heavy-water reactor for at least 15 years. That means, because of this deal, Iran will no longer have a source for weapons-grade plutonium.

Could there be a covert pathway to Iran building a secret nuclear program?

The previous three pathways occur at facilities that Iran has declared, but what if they try to build a nuclear program in secret? That’s why this deal is so important. Under the new nuclear deal, Iran has committed to extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection. International inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will not only be continuously monitoring every element of Iran’s declared nuclear program, but they will also be verifying that no fissile material is covertly carted off to a secret location to build a bomb. And if IAEA inspectors become aware of a suspicious location, Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to their IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which will allow inspectors to access and inspect any site they deem suspicious. Such suspicions can be triggered by holes in the ground that could be uranium mines, intelligence reports, unexplained purchases, or isotope alarms.

Basically, from the minute materials that could be used for a weapon comes out of the ground to the minute it is shipped out of the country, the IAEA will have eyes on it and anywhere Iran could try and take it:",3141

Five French Foreign Legionnaires have been killed and six injured in an avalanche while on a training exercise in the Alps, officials say.

The avalanche came down close to Valfrejus, not far from the Italian border, where some 50 soldiers were training off-piste.

Search dogs and helicopters immediately began looking for the soldiers.

Last week, two school pupils and a Ukrainian tourist were killed by an avalanche nearby.

A teacher is under investigation for manslaughter after he apparently led his pupils on to a closed ski run shortly before the avalanche in Les Deux Alpes, 124km (80 miles) away from Valfrejus.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Prime Minister Manuel Valls said France was now ""in mourning""

Heavy snow has fallen in the Savoie region recently.

About 10 of the military team were immediately found by rescuers - but five had gone into cardiac arrest, and died.

The soldiers were skiing in the Petit Argentier area at a height of 2,200m (7,200ft) when they were caught up in the avalanche shortly before 14:00 (13:00GMT), local reports said.

The soldiers were members of the 2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment based at Saint-Christol in southern France. They had been training at France's national centre for mountain warfare at Modane.

The group was a mixture of veterans and new recruits, lawmaker Julien Aubert told France's BFM television.

The French Foreign Legion was set up in the 19th Century for foreign nationals to serve in the French armed forces, although it is also open to French citizens.

The nationalities of the victims were not immediately known.

Image copyright AFP PHOTO / LEDAUPHINE.COM Image caption An investigation into the accident is now under way

All the soldiers taking part in the exercises had avalanche detection kits, and rescuers were on the scene within minutes, reports said.

Two of those found by rescuers were taken to hospital suffering from hypothermia.

The renewed popularity of the ""Fast and Furious"" series in the years before the crash gave Walker's career a second wind, an unexpected twist for the actor who became a star at the peak of the teen movie craze of the late 90s.

The two distinct phases of Walker's film career created a unique arc that also included an in-between period where he took on riskier roles, resulting in some of his best work and a career that didn't peter out like those of his former teenage contemporaries.

""Fast and Furious"" Series



As Brian O'Conner, the cop-turned-thief of the blockbuster racing series, Walker was the actor who appeared in the most installments and played in important role by bringing the audience into the world of racing for pinks and the violence that can come afterwards. With ""Fast and Furious 7"" already filming and plans for eighth and ninth installments coming together, it was likely that Walker's presence in the series would have continued for years to come.

""She's All That"" (1999)



During the late 90s, teen-centric dramedies experienced a big comeback, and one of the movies that came to embody that trend was undoubtedly ""She's All That."" Walker's role in the film highlighted his almost-too-handsome looks, as he played Dean Sampson, the jock friend of Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character and the guy who started the plot to turn an art nerd into prom queen in the first place.

""Varsity Blues"" (1999)



Like the movie itself, Walker in ""Varsity Blues"" was able to show off the darker side of a character and a story that we thought we knew. As Lance Harbor, the injured quarterback of a small-town Texas team, he took on material that wasn't totally new for him, but by the end of the movie, it was a distinct and memorable performance that would stand on its own.

""Pleasantville"" (1998)



Though movies like ""She's All That"" and ""Varsity Blues"" made Walker an important part of 90s movie culture, his role in ""Pleasantville"" proved that he also fit pretty well in a time long before that. The Tobey Maguire-Reese Witherspoon film from future ""Hunger Games"" director Gary Ross took two modern teenagers into a 1950s sitcom, complete with the perfect all-American boy, as played by Walker. His charm and dedication to the part brought an outlandish character to life in a relatable way.

""Running Scared"" (2006)



In the six years between ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and Walker's return to the series in ""Fast & Furious,"" he took on more challenging material that may not have sold as many tickets as the ones where he played Brian O'Conner, but ""Running Scared,"" along with Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" showed more of his range, while still playing to the strengths that audiences were familiar with. ""Running Scared"" casts Walker as a low-level mob enforcer who gets thrown into one hell of a bad night, as the gun he is tasked with hunting down keeps slipping away from him and his simple task becomes more complicated than he could have imagined.",3099
692063305297453060,non-rumor,Teacher Picks Wrong Student To Believe In Every Fucking Year https://t.co/EPpB5XFqwE https://t.co/1H82PSwQMT,http://onion.com/1SIeCRu,True,Teacher Picks Wrong Student To Believe In Every Fucking Year,"ROUND ROCK, TX—Frustrated at her repeated inability to steer a struggling young person in the right direction, McClintock High School English teacher Jan Broderic said Tuesday that she picks the wrong student to believe in every fucking year.

Broderic told reporters that not one of the students she has taken a special interest in has ever turned into an inspirational success story and that she was now “zero for 18” when it came to identifying bright but underachieving pupils and successfully unlocking their potential.

“I’ve been reaching out to promising kids that just need a little guidance since 1996, and to be honest, none of them has really blossomed into anything,” said the ninth-grade English teacher, adding that she was baffled by her inability to help a single troubled student maintain a C average, let alone make the honor roll. “For Christ’s sake, is it so hard to find one impressionable young person who no one else has ever believed in and turn their life around?”

“Every year, I tell myself I’m going to be the reason a struggling teenager excels beyond all expectations,” added Broderic. “And every goddamn year, I’m wrong.”

Since her first semester on staff at McClintock High, Broderic has repeatedly gone out of her way to nurture disruptive or withdrawn students that nevertheless displayed a certain spark, investing considerable time and energy that reportedly has not resulted in even one enrollment in an institution of higher education. According to Broderic, despite years of working individually with such students during lunch and after school, urging them to submit to the school’s literary magazine when they didn’t think they were talented enough, and even helping pay for their school supplies when their families could not afford to do so, she had “absolutely fucking zilch” to show for it.

Broderic confirmed to reporters that none of the students she has championed over the years has returned to campus to tell her she changed everything.

“I thought I had it in the bag with Zack Keeler back in 2003,” Broderic said. “When I first read his amazing Gatsby essay, I thought, this kid is really going to deliver. I’m going to give him some extra attention, and he’s going to get out of his tough neighborhood, maybe become a writer himself someday. Nope. Dropped out junior year and was cleaning pools last I heard. Completely crapped out on me.”

“I lent him my copy of Letters To A Young Poet,” said Broderic, a book she said greatly inspired her decision to become an educator. “He just drew samurai swords in the margins.”

According to Broderic, other disappointments included a student from Honduras who didn’t speak English until he was 7, a pregnant teenager who also worked a full-time cashier job, and a girl who had barely uttered a word since her father died—all of whom, despite Broderic’s dedicated mentoring, had “flamed out completely” before the year was even over.

“You know, maybe next year I’ll just pick a name out of a hat,” Broderic said. “I honestly couldn’t do any worse.”",3077

A British mother who took her toddler son to Syria, has been found guilty of membership of so-called Islamic State.

Tareena Shakil, 26, is the first British woman to return from the self-declared caliphate to be convicted of the offence.

Shakil, of Birmingham, has also been found guilty of encouraging acts of terrorism through messages posted on Twitter. She denied the charges.

She had admitted travelling to Syria.

But following a two-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court, the jury rejected her claim that she had only wished to live under Sharia law.

'Martyr' wish

The jury was shown her tweets, messages and photographs, including images of the black flag of IS and passages calling on people to ""take up arms"".

She had also stated her wish to become a ""martyr"".

Image caption The NSPCC said Tareena Shakil put her son in danger

Shakil, of Beechfield Road in Birmingham but formerly of Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire, posed with her son for pictures wearing an IS-branded balaclava after secretly running away to Syria in October 2014.

She told the court it was because he ""loved hats"".

Her defence team maintained she went to Syria with the toddler to escape an ""unhappy family life"".

Image copyright West Midlands Police Image caption The jury rejected Shakil's defence having seen a variety of images

Analysis by Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs correspondent

Tareena Shakil was charged with ""membership"" of the self-styled Islamic State organisation - but she never had a membership card. She says she deeply regrets going to Syria and, in a courtroom twist, told the jury she'd even been debriefed by MI5 on her return.

So why did she face this very serious charge?

Terrorism legislation basically says that membership of a banned group means to ""belong"".

Some organisations, such as Irish paramilitaries, had formal procedures for membership. With IS, men swear an oath, but the situation with women is less clear.

The jury was told to not think about membership in terms of belonging to a library or a gym. Instead, they had to decide whether Tareena Shakil voluntarily went to be with IS in Syria, knowing its aims, how it would achieve them and, crucially, seeking to associate with like-minded individuals.

An NSPCC spokesman said: ""It is inconceivable that a mother would be willing to put her child in such a dangerous situation, potentially exposing him to harm and even death.""

Shakil left IS territory in January 2015.

Her defence said she was unhappy in Syria and she told the court: ""I came back of my own free will. I came back because I realised I had made a mistake.""

Shakil said she caught a bus to escape the terror group's clutches, bribing a taxi driver to take her part of the way before dashing across the Turkish border under the noses of an IS patrol.

She is due to be sentenced on Monday.",3068

(Alejandro Pagni/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)

Last week, Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ""adopted"" a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf, according to multiple news reports. A report in the Guardian subsequently deemed the story spurious.

Kirchner tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil, the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family, during which the Tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah. She was adopting the child as her godson, a symbolic gesture made by generations of Argentine leaders over the years.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera — Cristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) December 23, 2014

According to the Independent, tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as ""el lobison"" in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form. The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf-child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born, which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing.

In the past half-century, the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now, for the first time, Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non-Catholic families. The boy's new status as the president's godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship, according to the Independent.

Tales of shape-shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau, an evil mythological spirit, and Kerana, a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was ""Luison,"" who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and feeds on corpses.

But, citing an Argentine historian, the Guardian disputes the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson, and says the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants. In updates posted to their Web sites, both the Independent and Buzzfeed say European folklore surrounding seventh sons included fears of the child turning into a monster.

In any case, Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentina's head of state, in whatever form. After all, the U.S. president participates in the ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year.

French police have arrested a man carrying two guns at an entrance to a hotel at Disneyland Paris.

The man, reportedly aged 28 and not known to security services, was also discovered with a copy of the Koran and a box of ammunition, police said.

His bag triggered metal detectors as he entered the New York Hotel at the much-visited theme park.

France remains in a state of emergency declared in November after the deadly attacks by jihadist militants in Paris.

So-called Islamic State (IS) said it carried out the co-ordinated assaults that left 130 people dead.

'Routine screening'

Disneyland Paris closed briefly after the November attacks, but the theme park remained open following Thursday's incident.

""During a routine security screening checkpoint at one of our hotels, weapons were discovered in a guest's luggage through our X-ray machine,"" spokesman Francois Banon said.

""The police were immediately notified and the individual was arrested. We continue to work closely with the authorities and the safety and security of our guests and cast members is our utmost priority.""

""There was loads of security, there were sniffer dogs, which you wouldn't see in any hotel and there was security as well,"" Ronan Flaherty, who was staying at the premises at the time, told the BBC.

A police source told the AFP news agency that a preliminary investigation did not point to terrorism, and that the man had said he was carrying the weapons because he feared for his safety.

Disneyland Paris

First opened in 1992 and located in Marne-la-Vallee, a town about 30km (18 miles) east of Paris.

Had about 10 million visitors in 2014 and calls itself the most visited tourist destination in Europe

92% of its guests are from Europe, with 49% from France, 16% from the UK and 9% from Spain.

Hosts about 1,000 business events each year

In July, the EU began an inquiry into the theme park, following accusations that UK and German customers were frozen out of certain promotions.

Sources: Disneyland Paris, European Commission, Global Attractions Attendance Report

Papers found on the suspect indicated that he lived in Paris, the source added.

He reportedly co-manages a brasserie in the French capital.

""For me, it's a mistake,"" said a member of the bar staff.

Police also arrested a woman, believing her to be the man's girlfriend, but later released her when they realised they had got the wrong woman, French media reported.

The interior ministry said police were still searching for a woman who might have been with the man, according to the Reuters news agency.

There's an illustration being shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter that claims to be a tribute created by street artist Banksy in response to the terrorist attack that killed 12 people near the offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris earlier today.

While the image does have a touching message, it's a fake - not created by Banksy.

Here's the illustration that everyone is sharing:

Mashable is reporting that the image was posted by a ""popular 'Banksy' account"" on Instagram. The instagram.com/banksy Instagram isn't run by Banksy at all, and is actually a fan page that shares street art created by a variety of different artists - rarely with any attribution.

Banksy has issued a statement to the Independent denying that the illustration is his work. ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy,"" said a spokesman for the anonymous artist.

Instead, it appears that the illustration was originally posted by graphic designer Lucille Clerc, just with an added Instagram filter.

Here's Clerc's original Instagram post:

Break one, thousand will rise #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie #raiseyourpencil A photo posted by Lucille Clerc (@lucille_clerc) on Jan 1, 2015 at 2:12pm PST

Search on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you'll see plenty of popular accounts that seem to be official Banksy pages. The problem of fake social media accounts is so widespread that Banksy has even posted on his official website to deny he runs any Facebook or Twitter accounts. He does, however, have one Instagram account, which was used during his recent trip to New York.

Facebook was recently forced to remove the verification checkmark for a Facebook page for a Banksy account with millions of Likes after the artists PR representative denied that he had anything to do with it.

The Instagram account that the pencil illustration originates from is part of a ring of fake social media profiles. As well as the fake Instagram and Facebook accounts, the administrators behind the Banksy pages also run a YouTube account that re-uploads popular viral videos to capitalize on their popularity.

Here's an example of a video posted by the fake Banksy YouTube account:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn't want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.

It's tricky to verify new Banksy work. Because of Banksy's continued anonymity, and the often confusing similarity to other graffiti artists, many works of art end up mistakenly labeled as created by Banksy. A handful of galleries and companies in the UK are, however, experts in his work, meaning that they can verify prints purported to originate from Banksy.

Nevertheless, given today's tragic events, the sentiment is strong.",2967

A woman who stabbed a paedophile to death in east London has had her three-and-a-half-year jail sentence more than doubled.

Sarah Sands, 32, was found guilty of the manslaughter of Michael Pleasted, 77, after learning he had been charged with sexually assaulting young boys.

He was stabbed eight times and bled to death, the trial heard.

The Court of Appeal ruled the sentence was too lenient and increased it to seven-and-a-half years.

Image caption Michael Pleasted was on bail awaiting trial when he was killed

Sands was found guilty of his death by reason of loss of control.

Pleasted, who had previous convictions, was on bail awaiting trial when he was killed at his Canning Town flat in east London.

The original case heard the mother-of-five, who was cleared of murder, had originally befriended Pleasted and taken him food.

However, when she found out his past she armed herself with a knife and carried out a ""determined and sustained attack"" at his flat.

Image copyright Google Image caption Michael Pleasted was killed at his Canning Town flat in east London

After handing herself in, Sands told a police officer the victim had touched some children ""so I took care of it - I stabbed him"".

She told the court she had not intended to hurt Pleasted but he ""smirked"" when he answered the door and told her the boys were all liars who had ruined his life.

During the trial Judge Nicholas Cooke QC said the case was ""unique"" as Sands had lost control rather than taken the law into her own hands and engage in ""vigilante conduct"".

He said: ""This was a case in which the defendant promptly gave herself up to the police in a highly stressed state, never disputed responsibility for the killing as a matter of fact, did not take the opportunity to get rid of evidence and demonstrated remorse.""

But Sands' sentence was referred by the Attorney General after 30 members of the public complained about its original length.

Twenty-four convictions

At the time he took into account the fact she was a mother, had shown remorse and had never denied the killing.

But the three judges sitting at the Court of Appeal ruled that because Sands had taken a knife with her when she went to Pleasted's flat it meant the starting point for sentencing should have been 10 years.

Mitigating factors reduced it to seven-and-a-half years.

Pleasted, who also went by the name of Robin Moult, had 24 previous convictions for sexual offences spanning three decades.

He was not on the sex offenders register as he committed his offences before it was introduced in 1997.

At the time of the attack, Pleasted was on bail awaiting trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court on two charges of sexual assault on two children aged under 13.

Officers were also investigating a further allegation he had abused a third boy.",2950

Previously uninterpreted data showing vertical movement of the fault’s crust detected several millimeters of uplift and subsidence in surface areas as large as 125 miles.

While these hotspots were predicted in models before, this is the first time scientists were able to block out white noise and other diluting factors such as precipitation and local surface geology.

‘The Big One’ is expected to produce a game-changing earthquake within the next 30 years causing massive devastation to California.

Federal, state, and military officials have been working on contingency plans for the looming disaster, which could see 14,000 dead and 30,000 injured, according to AP.

A 2005 study published in the journal Nature found the fault had reached a sufficient level of stress for an earthquake of a magnitude greater than 7.0, with the risk concentrated on the area of the fault near Los Angeles.

According to the new research, scientists will be able to study and understand the behavior of faults, even when dormant, using the vertical readings in the hope of predicting activity.

Emergency services will also benefit from more accurate seismic hazard estimates, predicting where on the surface movement is more likely to occur when ‘The Big One’ eventually strikes.

Seven employees of a popular privately-run Afghan TV channel were killed after their bus was targeted by a suicide car bomber in the capital Kabul.

At least 20 others - including passers-by - were wounded.

Tolo TV tweeted: ""Unfortunately, in the terrorist attack today... we lost seven staff members"".

The Taliban said it carried out the attack. It had threatened to target Tolo over its news coverage of the fighting in Kunduz city in September.

The bus was reportedly taking staff from Tolo and its parent media organisation home for the day when it was rammed by the suicide bomber in central Kabul.

The explosion sent black smoke billowing into the sky, with emergency services rushing to the scene.

A Tolo TV staff member told the BBC's Kawoon Khamoosh he was fortunate to be alive after nearly burning to death.

Announcing what had happened in a live broadcast, Tolo news presenter Fawad Aman said: ""The enemy of humanity, peace and Islam martyred our colleagues because they were exposing their crimes

""They martyred you to silence us, but they will never achieve this evil goal.""

Tolo TV runs Afghanistan's first 24-hour news channel and, along with its website, is one of the country's most well-known news sources.

Tolo had implemented tighter security measures in recent months after the Taliban threatened it and another privately-run news channel, 1TV, over their coverage of the fight for Kunduz, calling them ""satanic networks"".

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack in a tweet, describing it as a ""barbaric attack carried out by coward terrorists"".

Correspondents say it is the first major attack on an Afghan media organisation since the Taliban were overthrown by US-led forces in 2001.

Early reports of Wednesday's blast suggested the Russian embassy was struck, but the Russian foreign ministry said damage to the building was minimal.

The Taliban have launched numerous previous attacks on Kabul.

Since the beginning of 2016, the city has been hit by at least six bomb attacks - in the most recent, on Sunday, a rocket landed near the Italian embassy, wounding two security guards. The Indian and Pakistani missions have also recently been targeted in other parts of the country.

Last week at least seven Afghan security personnel were killed in a gun battle near the Pakistani consulate in Jalalabad.

Observers have speculated that the attacks near foreign missions could also be aimed at destabilising attempts to revive peace talks with the Taliban.",2939

According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums , using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings.

North Korea says it has arrested a US student accused of committing a ""hostile act"" against the state.

State news agency KCNA identified him as University of Virginia student Otto Frederick Warmbier.

He had entered North Korea as a tourist with the intention ""to destroy the country's unity"", said KCNA, which added that the US government had ""tolerated and manipulated"" him.

It did not give further details, but said he was now under investigation.

The US State Department is ""aware of media reports that a US citizen was detained in North Korea"" and is working with its protecting power, the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said.

He said that no further information would be shared at this time due to privacy concerns.

North Korea sometimes uses the detention of foreigners as a means of exerting pressure on its adversaries.

Image copyright AP Image caption The incident follows escalating tensions with rivals including the US and South Korea

Detained on tour

China-based tour agency Young Pioneer Tours released a statement confirming that Mr Warmbier had been detained while on one of their tours in Pyongyang, and said his family had been informed.

It had earlier told Reuters that Mr Warmbier was arrested on 2 January.

""We are in contact with the Swedish Embassy... who are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the case. We are also assisting the US Department of State closely with regards to the situation,"" it said in the statement.

""In the meantime we would appreciate Otto's and his family's privacy being respected and we hope his release can be secured as soon as possible.""

Sweden represents US interests in North Korea as Washington and Pyongyang do not have diplomatic relations.

Mr Warmbier, listed by the University of Virginia's directory as an undergraduate commerce student, is the third Westerner known to be held in North Korea.

Hyeon Soo Lim, a Canadian pastor of South Korean origin, was sentenced to life imprisonment in December for an alleged plot to overthrow the government.

A Korean-American is also thought to be in North Korean detention on charges of spying.

The latest incident comes amid escalating tensions, after the North said it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. The claim has not yet been confirmed.

South Korea has resumed propaganda broadcasts over the border, while the North has been dropping propaganda leaflets on the South.

The United States is leading calls for new UN economic penalties against the North in the wake of the nuclear test.

We all know birds in North America fly south for the winter and revisit us come spring, but have you ever wondered what their journey looks like once they leave our backyards?

Ornithologists from Cornell University developed this migration map to show a year’s worth of travels for more than a hundred bird species across the Western Hemisphere. Each dot represents a different avian group as it flies thousands of miles to breed and feast. To create the map, the researchers used data from more than a million observations made by amateur bird watchers through eBird, a citizen science project.

“This is the first comprehensive picture of where these birds are moving across the entire year,” said Frank La Sorte, an ornithologist at Cornell and one of the map creators. It would have cost millions of dollars to gather the information needed to reconstruct the trajectories with traditional tracking methods, he said. “Even if we tracked hundreds and hundreds of birds, we would not get this level of detail.”

Dr. La Sorte said that through their analysis, first published last week in a biological research journal, he and his colleagues attempted to address what they consider the “big question in migration ecology”: What migration strategies do birds use to journey across the Western Hemisphere?

They found three general types of trajectories, including clockwise movement, counterclockwise movement, and a doubling back along the same path.

Birds that fly over the eastern portion of North America tend to follow routes that make large clockwise loops. In autumn they travel south through the Atlantic into the Caribbean and South America, and then in spring they loop back north through the Gulf of Mexicoand via a route that is further inland than their previous one. This path enables species like the American Golden-Plover and Blackpoll Warbler to take advantage of strong winds that help propel them in their desired direction.

Flocks that travel over the western portion of the continent, like the Hermit Warbler and the Dusky Flycatcher, do not make dramatic loops like their eastern counterparts. Instead they tend to follow the same track along mountain and river corridors through Mexico, Central and South America in both the fall and spring. In the middle of the continent, birds use all three strategies, though counterclockwise migrations are more common here than elsewhere, Dr. La Sorte said.",2895

Donald Trump expressed his opinion on Wednesday, January 20, about celebrities boycotting the 2016 Oscars over the lack of minority nominees — and the presidential hopeful has only riled up more scandal with his latest remarks.

Trump, 69, followed Stacey Dash's lead on Fox & Friends, where both guests were asked about the Academy Awards brouhaha. Dash, a Fox contributor, called out Black Entertainment Television (BET) for giving awards largely to black people. ""I think it's ludicrous, because we have to make up our minds,"" the Clueless alum, 49, told Steve Doocy. ""Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don't want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you're only awarded if you're black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It's a double standard.""

Later in the show, Trump weighed in. ""I saw somebody on your show today say, 'Well, what do we do with BET?'"" said the real estate mogul, who called into the program the morning after Sarah Palin endorsed him for president. ""The whites don't get any nominations, and I thought it was an amazing interview, actually. I've never even thought of it from that standpoint.""

He continued: ""I mean, I’ve watched over the years where African Americans have in fact received Academy Awards and have in fact been represented,"" Trump said. ""And this is not one of those years, but over the years I’ve seen numerous black actors and African American actors receive awards and I think that’s great. This doesn’t happen to be one of those years. … It's a difficult situation.""

The Oscars uproar started last Thursday, January 14, after the 2016 nominees were announced and none of the actors represented in the major categories were nonwhite. Host Chris Rock also joked that this year's show is the ""white BET Awards."" Then, on Monday, the situation escalated when both Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee said they were not attending the show.

In response, Will Smith's former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air costar Janet Hubert slammed the Concussion actor and his wife in a video message about their reactions to the nominees.

""Maybe you didn't deserve a nomination,"" Hubert, 60, who played Aunt Vivian on the sitcom from 1990 to 1993, said to the actor. ""I didn't think, frankly, you deserved a Golden Globe nomination. … Y'all need to get over yourselves. … You are a part of Hollywood. You are a part of the system that is unfair to other actors.""

März liess er sich zum letzten Mal blicken: Bei einem Empfang von Italiens Ministerpräsident Matteo Renzi im Kreml.

Seither ist Wladimir Putin von der Bildfläche verschwunden. Zwar veröffentlicht sein Büro immer wieder Informationen zu Terminen, die der Staatspräsident in den letzten Tagen wahrgenommen hat, zeigt sogar Bilder.

Doch russische Medien widerlegen die Angaben. Veröffentlichte Fotos stammen von früheren Terminen, angebliche Gesprächspartner sind gar nicht in der Stadt, als sie sich laut dem Kreml mit Putin getroffen haben sollen.

Wo also ist Putin? Ein Erkrankung des 62-Jährigen hat der Kreml heftig dementiert. Er sei kerngesund, seine Begrüssung «könne eine Hand brechen». Warum lässt er sich trotzdem nicht blicken? Wilde Theorien machen die Runde.

Das wildesteste Gerücht aber kommt nicht aus Russland, sondern – aus einer Geburtenabteilung im Tessin. Der halbe Kanton spreche schon davon, sagt eine Tessinerin zu Blick.ch: Putins Freundin Alina Kabajewa (32) habe vor wenigen Tagen in die Clinica Sant'Anna in Sorengo TI eingecheckt, wo sie ihr gemeinsames Kind zur Welt bringen wolle.

Das sei einer Bekannten herausgerutscht, die dort arbeite. Lässt Putin deshalb die Weltpolitik ruhen? Hat er Kabajewa sogar heimlich begleitet?

Es wird wohl nie eine Bestätigung dafür geben.

Aber unmöglich ist es nicht, dass ein möglicher Putin-Spross in der Schweizer Sonnenstube das Licht der Welt erblickt. Schliesslich geniesst die Clinica Sant'Anna einen ausgezeichneten Ruf. Speziell die gynäkologische Abteilung ist das Prunkstück der Klinik.

Und: Viele reiche Russen lassen sich dort behandeln. Deshalb gibt es von der Homepage neben der italienischen und der englischen auch eine russische Version. Putin könnte Kabajewa ins Ausland geschickt haben, um sie vor den russischen Medien in Sicherheit zu bringen. Denn die Beziehung der beiden gilt als grösstes offenes Geheimnis in Russland.

Den Tipp für die Geburtsklinik könnte Putin übrigens von seinem guten Freund Silvio Berlusconi bekommen haben. Der war 2009 in der VIP-Klinik auf Babybesuch: Seine Tochter Barbara brachte hier ihr Kind Edoardo zur Welt.

Kabajewa, die ehemalige Olympiasiegerin der Rhythmischen Sportgymnastik, ist erst im September von ihrem Posten als Abgeordnete der Putin-Partei zurückgetreten. In der Folge wurde sie überraschend zur Chefin der mächtigen Nationalen Mediengruppe (NMG) ernannt – und trat kaum mehr öffentlich auf.

Das Putin-Baby aus dem Tessin könnte sogar schon das dritte gemeinsame Kind von Putin und Kabajewa sein, 2009 sollen schon Sohn Dmitri und 2012 eine Tochter zur Welt gekommen sein.

Auf Twitter wird das Verschwinden Putins durchaus schon mit Kabajewa in Zusammenhang gebracht. Laut Gerüchten soll diese nämlich seit dem 6. März nicht mehr bei der Arbeit erschienen sein. (bih)",2871

Hours before he and an unidentified man lost their lives in a single car collision and explosion, the 40-year-old actor was co-hosting a charity event for Philippines Typhoon victims in Santa Clarita, Calif. through his non-profit organization, Reach Out Worldwide.

PHOTOS: Stars we've lost in 2013

In 2010, ROWW was created as a disaster relief organization to help victims from the Haiti earthquake in January 2010. After taking a trip there, Walker returned and according to the site, ""contacted a group of his friends to assist him in forming ROWW with the purpose of filling this unmet need"" of skilled resources. Since then, the organization has helped victims of the Oklahoma City tornado in June, and other victims from natural disasters.

After attending the toy drive Saturday, titled ""Winter Drive,"" Walker went for a drive in a red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, which belonged to a friend, TMZ reports. The Fast and the Furious actor was the passenger when his friend lost control and slammed the vehicle into a tree.

The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station confirmed to Us Weekly in a statement that there were two fatalities in the traffic collision at approximately 3:30 p.m. The Los Angeles County Fire Department extinguished the fiery fire, but the victims were dead at the scene.

Hours before the crash, Walker took what would be one of his last photos with an entrepreneur, Bill Townsend. Shortly after the tragic news broke, Townsend shared the picture and a message on his Facebook page.

""I was just with him no more than 2 or 3 hours ago. Talking cars, he was so happy seeing all his friends get together to look at the cars,"" he wrote. ""I hope it wasn't him in the wreck, but if it was, he would have passed doing something he loved, which is driving cars. The world lost an angel in Paul. He dedicated so much of his life to helping disadvantaged kids and people who are in need, with his charity recently assisting those in the tornadoes in the Midwest and the trauma in the Philippines.""

He added: ""Just today we had hundreds of toys donated for kids, all apart of Paul's charity. If this sad news indeed true I’m going to do whatever I can to keep Paul's goals for the charity alive.""

In the photo, Walker had his hands in his pocket as he wore a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and donned some scruff. Walker had been gearing up the past few months to reprise his role as Brian O'Conner in Fast and the Furious 7, which is set for a 2014 release date.

Is there anybody out there? Two astronomers say they have found evidence that a planet around 10 times the mass of Earth is lurking in the outer reaches of the solar system, on an orbit that comes no closer than 200 times the distance between the sun and Earth. Dubbed Planet Nine, it hasn’t been seen directly. Instead, Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena have inferred its existence from the strange orbits of other, smaller bodies.

If the planet is confirmed, it could steal the crown lost by the now-demoted Pluto – ironic, as Brown, who calls himself “plutokiller” on Twitter, was instrumental in that world’s downfall. In 2005 he discovered a Pluto-sized object, now known as Eris, in a distant region of the solar system called the Kuiper belt, leading to the reclassification of both objects as dwarf planets.

Brown and others have continued to explore the Kuiper belt and have discovered many small bodies. One called 2012 VP113, which was discovered in 2014, raised the possibility of a large, distant planet, after astronomers realised its orbit was strangely aligned with a group of other objects. Now Brown and Batygin have studied these orbits in detail and found that six follow elliptical orbits that point in the same direction and are similarly tilted away from the plane of the solar system.

“It’s almost like having six hands on a clock all moving at different rates, and when you happen to look up, they’re all in exactly the same place,” said Brown in a press release announcing the discovery. The odds of it happening randomly are just 0.007 per cent. “So we thought something else must be shaping these orbits.”

According to the pair’s simulations, that something is a planet that orbits on the opposite side of the sun to the six smaller bodies. Gravitational resonance between this Planet Nine and the rest keep everything in order. The planet’s high, elongated orbit keeps it at least 200 times further away from the sun than Earth, and it would take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years just to complete a single orbit.

Get hunting

The pair have detailed their findings in a paper published in the Astronomical Journal today, but as yet they have no direct evidence for the existence of the new planet, which means it’s time for astronomers to fire up their telescopes and get hunting.

“All those people who are mad that Pluto is no longer a planet can be thrilled to know that there is a real planet out there still to be found,” said Brown. “Now we can go and find this planet and make the solar system have nine planets once again.”

693465666259656705,non-rumor,Turkey claims Russian plane violated its airspace and summons ambassador https://t.co/cIvB03dzRZ,http://bbc.in/1KN5frU,True,Turkey says Russia violated its airspace near Syria border,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian SU-34 fighter bombers are based at Hmeymim airbase in Syria

Turkey has accused Russia of again violating its airspace and warned it would ""face consequences"" if such infringements continue.

The foreign ministry said a Russian jet flew into its airspace on the border with Syria on Friday. Moscow described the claim as ""baseless propaganda"".

Tensions between the two countries have been high since November, when Turkey shot down a Russian jet.

Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September.

It has been targeting forces fighting the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its ally.

'Irresponsible steps'

In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said a Russian SU-34 jet crossed into Turkish airspace at 11:46 local time on Friday, ignoring several warnings made in Russian and English.

It said the ministry had summoned the Russian ambassador in Ankara to ""strongly protest at and condemn"" the incident.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned on Saturday that Russia would ""have to face consequences if it keeps up such violations"".

""Such irresponsible steps do not benefit either the Russian Federation, or Russia-Nato relations, or regional and global peace,"" he told reporters.

He said he had asked repeatedly for a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, without success.

Nato - of which Turkey is a member - on Saturday urged Russia ""to act responsibility and to fully respect Nato airspace"" and ""take all necessary measures to ensure that such violations do not happen again"".

But Russia's defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov firmly denied there had been any violation of airspace.

""We can categorically state that neither Russia's air defence systems in Syria nor Syria's airspace surveillance radar registered any violation of the Syrian-Turkish border, not to mention the fact that there has been no voice contact between Turkey and our pilots for a long time now,"" he told Russian news agency Interfax.

Relations between Russia and Turkey, a vocal opponent of Mr Assad, plummeted after Turkish F-16s shot down a Russian SU-24 on 24 November.

Turkey said the plane intruded into its airspace and ignored repeated warnings to leave.

Russia insisted the jet had never crossed over from Syrian territory and did not receive any warnings.

The two leaders embarked on a war of words and Russia introduced a raft of sanctions designed to damage Turkey's economy.

Moscow's ban on the import of Turkish foods, the sale of charter holidays for Russians to Turkey and most construction projects with Turkish firms was expected to cost the Turkish economy at least $10bn.",2837

President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years.

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared “el lobison”.

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew — Cristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) December 23, 2014

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption, aimed at stopping the deadly stigma.

Starting in 1907, the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron, which also extended the practice to baby girls.

Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pic.twitter.com/DVWewmZera — Cristina Kirchner (@CFKArgentina) December 23, 2014

Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship.

Even now, reports of dog-like creatures attacking livestock continue, as does the tradition.

Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted, as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009.

She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a “magical moment”.

Calling the Tawils a “marvellous family” she described Yair as “a total sweety” and dubbed his mother “Queen Esther.”

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers.

Pictures showed them lighting Hanukkah candles together on a menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family.

Update: An Argentine historian has since told the Guardian that the local lobison myth and the tradition of the seventh child becoming the President's godchild are not related. However, in Portuguese folklore the last-born of a series of seven or nine siblings is in danger of becoming a werewolf or a witch.",2833

https://t.co/U1hGutdEqs https://t.co/A4CHZ7n1D3",http://bbc.in/1SiudYn,True,Sweden masked gang 'targeted migrants' in Stockholm,"Image copyright TV4

Up to 100 masked men, dressed in black, gathered in central Stockholm to attack people from immigrant backgrounds, reports say.

Swedish police say the large gang distributed leaflets inciting people to assault refugees.

Witnesses said the men physically attacked people they believed were foreigners. However, police have not confirmed these reports.

It comes amid heightened tension in Sweden over the migrant crisis.

Some 163,000 migrants applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015, the highest per capita number in Europe.

According to Aftonbladet newspaper, the men in Stockholm were distributing leaflets on Friday evening with the slogan ""It's enough now!"",

The material threatened to give ""the North African street children who are roaming around"" the ""punishment they deserve.""

The newspaper published a video showing the gang clashing with police at Stockholm's central station.

Knuckledusters

Stockholm police said in a statement (in Swedish) that the group was handing out leaflets with the intention to incite people to carry out crimes.

One man was arrested after punching an officer in the face. Several others were detained on public order offences and another was found with brass knuckledusters, police said. All had been released by the following morning.

Image copyright TV4 Image caption Police apparently clashed with masked men outside Stockholm central station

Spokeswoman Towe Haegg told Swedish radio police had not received any reports of violence against people from migrant backgrounds.

However, Aftonbladet interviewed one 16-year-old who said he had been hit in the face near Stockholm's central station. The newspaper also quoted another witness who said he had seen men beating up people who appeared to have a foreign background in the middle of the city's Sergelstorg square.

The men were wearing arm bands of various colours and have been reportedly linked to football hooligan gangs.

There were scuffles on Saturday between pro and anti-migrant demonstrators, during which witnesses say foreigners were assaulted.

Tensions have increased after a 22-year-old employee was stabbed to death at a centre for young asylum seekers earlier this week. A 15-year-old asylum seeker was arrested in Molndal, near Gothenburg, over the murder.

Along with Germany, Sweden is a prime destination for refugees and illegal migrants entering the EU.

More than one million refugees and migrants travelled to Europe last year, most fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

The numbers arriving in Sweden have fallen significantly since it imposed tighter border controls this year.

On Thursday, Interior Minister Anders Ygeman said the country would prepare to deport up to 80,000 migrants whose asylum applications were rejected.",2790

Garnish his wages &amp; send 2 Red Cross http://t.co/FqxRTC8LSV,http://bit.ly/13IesPa,True,"Nidal Hasan Has Earned $278,000 in Salary Since the Fort Hood Shooting","This article is from the archive of our partner .

To date, preparations for the trial of accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan have cost the government at least $278,000 — and that's just in the salary that Hasan received since the 2009 massacre.

NBC's Dallas affiliate, KXAS, reports that Hasan, who at the time of the shooting was working as an Army psychiatrist, has continued to receive his salary for the past 42 months.

The Army said under the Military Code of Justice, Hasan’s salary cannot be suspended unless he is proven guilty.



If Hasan had been a civilian defense department employee, NBC 5 Investigates has learned, the Army could have suspended his pay after just seven days.

According to witnesses, Hasan shouted ""God is great"" in Arabic before opening fire, repeatedly targeting soldiers that had already been wounded. Thirteen people were killed and 30 wounded.

Despite those apparent details, however, the government doesn't classify the event as an act of combat or terror. According to the government, the shooting was ""workplace violence"" — meaning that the injured aren't entitled to additional pay or Purple Heart designations. Several members of Congress have written to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, asking for the event to be redesignated.

A number of the victims of the attack report that they were made personal promises by senior government officials that they and their family members would be “well taken care of” and that the “government will make [them] whole.” We believe that in the aftermath of the terrorist attack at Fort Hood … the decision to deem the incident “workplace violence” was an irresponsible, indefensible breach of our nation’s sacred pledge to our service members.

The Congressmembers also accuse Defense of kowtowing to ""political correctness"" in not designating the attack as a terror attack.

It's not likely that the KXAS report will result in Hasan losing his salary. For one thing, the stipulation that he continue receiving his salary stems from the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For another, Hasan receiving his salary was first reported back in 2011 by the ABC affiliate near Fort Hood. The commander of the facility explained the rationale.

Campbell said it's all part of the judicial process that says Hasan is innocent until proven guilty.



""The bottom line is when you cut through everything we are as an army, we have to be fair to him regardless of what we saw or we think we saw or whatever the case may be. It's imperative we maintain the integrity of the court martial so he gets as fair a shot as possible defending himself with his team,"" Campbell added.

Testimony in the trial will finally begin on July 1. By then, the salary Hasan has received since his arrest will likely top $290,000.",2781

Activists demanding free elections for the semi-autonomous territory have been holding their hands up in the air in a symbol of non-violent protest, a gesture many in the US recognize from recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri after an unarmed 18-year-old was shot to death by police.

RT @dangillmor Hong Kong ""hands up, don't shoot"" emulation of Ferguson protests is such a powerful image: pic.twitter.com/TPc8xUAs3k — Patrick Chovanec (@prchovanec) September 29, 2014

Most Hong Kong protesters aren’t purposefully mimicking “hands up, don’t shoot,”as some have suggested. Instead, the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders, who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police.

Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson, Icy Ng, a 22-year-old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said, “I don’t think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands.” Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator, Ellie Ng, 24, said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that “Hong Kong protesters are peaceful, unarmed, and mild.” (A more important symbol for the movement may be the umbrella, which protesters have been using to protect themselves against pepper spray and tear gas.)

Still, the gesture has taken on new meaning for Hong Kong residents whose relationship with the city’s police may never be the same. Hong Kong is one of the most intensively policed cities in the world, with a police force of 30,000 that rivals New York City’s but serves a fraction of New York’s population. The last time Hong Kong authorities used tear gas against demonstrators was in 2005, during demonstrations outside of a World Trade Organization meeting, and in 1967, when leftist activists rioted throughout the city.

Now, residents are shocked by images of students being tear gassed and elderly demonstrators being pepper sprayed in the face, footage that has prompted more protesters to join demonstrations on Monday.

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below

Leelah Alcorn, a 17-year-old transgender woman, left a heartbreaking suicide note on her Tumblr before getting hit by a semi-truck on Interstate 21 in Ohio.

First, she writes of how painful it is to go through life as a transgender woman whose family refuses to accept her identity:

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn't make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don't tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don't ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won't do anything but make them hate them self. That's exactly what it did to me.

Then, of the aftermath when her parents pulled her out of school for coming out as gay as a first step toward transitioning:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. ... People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

And lastly, of her hope that one day trans people can live a better life:

I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say ""that's fucked up"" and fix it. Fix society. Please.

First responders reporting from retail stores all across the nation said the record-breaking post-Thanksgiving shopping spree carnage began as early as midnight on Friday, when 13 million shoppers were reportedly trampled, pummeled, burned, stabbed, shot, lanced, and brutally beaten to death while attempting to participate in early holiday sales events.

Law enforcement officials said the bloodbath only escalated throughout the weekend as hordes of savage holiday shoppers began murdering customers at Wal-Mart, Sears, and JCPenney locations nationwide, leaving piles of dismembered and mutilated corpses in their wake.

“The level of bloodshed this year was almost beyond imagination—no prior Black Friday could have prepared us for this,” said National Guard commander Frank Grass, talking to reporters in front of the still-smoldering remains of a local Best Buy that was burned to the ground Saturday. “We had fire trucks, police cruisers, and guardsmen stationed at multiple locations, but it was useless. At the moment, hundreds of thousands of American shoppers are still unaccounted for, and we expect $2 billion in damage has been wrought upon our cities. ”

“The stench of death is unbearable,” a tearful Grass added. “Simply unbearable.”

As the weekend of sales drew to a close, ambulances could be seen circling the now empty and completely ravaged shopping complexes as they searched for signs of life, while clean-up crews worked to clear the rubble, overturned cars, and large pools of blood from local Kohl’s and Macy’s parking lots.

The White House issued an official response, stating, “We mourn the deaths of those 42 million American shoppers who tragically lost their lives this Black Friday.”

Survivors of the deadly holiday sales event said that while the weekend began as a chance to “get in on some unbeatable post-Thanksgiving deals,” it quickly escalated into a merciless, no-hold-barred fight to the death.

“At some point in time we all stopped caring about the deals and the holiday shopping and were pretty much just out for blood,” said Dana Marshall, 37, a Target shopper who suffered seven broken ribs and a cracked sternum while fighting two other customers for a discounted Nikon digital camera. “I remember just sitting on top of a woman and smacking her head with a DVD player until her face was completely unrecognizable. I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing.”

“At some point in time we all stopped caring about the deals and the holiday shopping and were pretty much just out for blood,” said Dana Marshall, 37, a Target shopper who suffered seven broken ribs and a cracked sternum while fighting two other customers for a discounted Nikon digital camera. “I remember just sitting on top of a woman and smacking her head with a DVD player until her face was completely unrecognizable. I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing.”

514517470238240768,false,And here's a guy bending an iPhone 6 Plus with his bare hands http://t.co/6z7fHaeiYn http://t.co/Pb74z0LwVg,http://gizmo.do/74dBvKC,True,And Here's a Guy Bending an iPhone 6 Plus With His Bare Hands,"Just a few hours ago, we started hearing reports that a small sampling of iPhone 6 Plus owners have experienced a slight bend to their phone after putting the device in their front pockets. And now, here's what appears to be video proof that—yep, this smartphone sure can bend. Although it sure takes some effort.

Lou from Unbox Therapy puts the rumors to the test with his bare hands, and though it clearly takes quite a bit of force, he is able to give that handset one hell of an angle. The glass hangs in there, so it's still functional. And while it's clearly not something that will happen with normal use, the fact that it could happen at all is a bit concerning.

According to experts, though, it probably shouldn't be surprising. As Jeremy Irons, a Design Engineer at Creative Engineering explained:

From an engineering standpoint, the iPhone is an amazingly small and delicately constructed device. The only thing really contributing to the structural integrity of the iPhone 6 Plus is the thin aluminum frame that covers the back and reaches around the sides. There is also another very thin piece of steel behind the glass, but we are not working with much as far as bending strength.

Here's that oh-so-thin piece of steel from iFixit's iPhone 6 Plus teardown:

But according to Irons, that's not going to be quite enough to make up for the strength lost to thinness:

Previous iPhones were thicker and not as long. In material bending, larger cross sectional areas (thickness x width) and shorter lengths make things stronger (You can't easily bend a cube), while the opposite makes things very easy to bend (paper is easily folded). The increased length and decreased thickness contribute to the weakness of the new iPhone. Strength is proportionally related to length, but strength is affected much more by changes in thickness. All other things being equal, this 0.5 mm change in thickness greatly affects the bending strength. While the iPhone 5S was only 7% thicker than the iPhone 6 Plus, it was actually 22% stronger in bending. When you make something longer, it gets proportionally more bendable, when you make it thinner, it gets a lot more bendable.

Still, it's important to note that, though extreme in this case, a slight bending with use isn't all that uncommon, as Irons emphasizes:

As a disclaimer, we know nothing about the intricacies of the iPhone and this is just speculation based on our engineering knowledge. I read that phones often become bent during use and the pictures that are surfacing may only be from extreme cases, and not an actual defect in the product.

We've reached out to Apple for comment on the issue and will update as soon as we hear back. [Thanks Lewis!]",2746

Last year was the warmest year on record, smashing the record set in 2014 by a huge margin, several agencies have confirmed.

But it is unlikely to hold on to the record for long; this year is likely to be even warmer.

In 2015 the global average surface temperature was 0.75 °C higher than the 1960 to 1990 average according to the UK’s Met Office, smashing the record of 0.57 °C higher set in 2014.

That is a huge increase: record years are usually only marginally warmer than the previous record. And 2016 is expected to smash the record again, according to the Met Office, with the global surface temperature rising to 0.84 °C.

Global warming is, of course, the main reason why the record for the warmest year keeps being broken. Every year the planet as a whole is accumulating more heat energy as a result of rising greenhouse gas levels.

The vast majority of this heat goes into the oceans rather than the lower atmosphere. Just how much varies from year to year, largely because of the natural phenomenon known as the El Niño and La Niña cycle.

Underestimate?

During La Niñas, cold surface waters in the Pacific soak up even more heat than usual, which can cool the lower atmosphere and thus lower surface temperatures. During El Niños, warm surface waters in the Pacific release a little heat, warming the lower atmosphere.

We are currently in the middle of what is by some measures the strongest El Niño ever recorded, which is why global surface temperatures have shot up so much. Many other factors, from the solar cycle to levels of aerosol pollution in the atmosphere, also have a role.

As New Scientist revealed in July, we are already halfway to 2 °C – the level countries decided it would be dangerous to exceed.

Average global surface temperatures have now risen by more than 1 °C compared with pre-industrial times, according to all the main records of global surface temperatures, including those compiled by the UK’s Met Office, and by NASA and NOAA in the US.

These records differ slightly because of the way they handle regions where there are no weather stations, like most of the fast-warming Arctic. The Met Office record simply excludes these regions – and thus likely underestimates global warming – while the others extrapolate the missing data by various methods.

Even if countries stick to the climate change commitments they made at the UN climate summit in Paris in November last year, the world is currently on track to warm by 3 or 4 °C by 2100. That is the most likely outcome for the estimated amount of emissions, but the resulting warming could be less than this, or as much as 5 or 6 °C.

Dr. Erwin Huebner, University of Manitoba / Wikipedia A deadly illness from abroad has made its way to the U.S. - but it's not Ebola. Several cases of ""kissing bug"" disease, known formally as Chagas disease, have recently been identified in Texas, according to researchers gathered Tuesday at the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting in New Orleans.

The Washington Post reports that health officials found 17 Houston residents who had been infected with Chagas, a disease native to Latin America that is spread to humans through contact with the parasitic triatomine bug, or so-called kissing bug. The tiny insect feeds on human blood by biting people's faces during the night. It carries a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes the disease.

Additionally, researchers found that one in every 6,500 blood donors in Texas tested positive for exposure to the parasite - about 50 times higher than Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. ""We were astonished to not only find such a high rate of individuals testing positive for Chagas in their blood, but also high rates of heart disease that appear to be Chagas-related,"" Nolan Garcia, an epidemiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston whose research focused on Chagas disease in the U.S., said in a statement.

CDC officials, however, said they believe most people infected with Chagas contracted the parasite in Mexico or South America before coming to the U.S. About 7 million to 8 million people are thought to be infected with the parasite worldwide, mostly in Latin America, the World Health Organization has said.

""There have been a few reports of people becoming infected with these bugs here in the United States,"" Susan Montgomery of the CDC's parasitic diseases branch said, according to HealthDay. ""We don't know how often that is happening because there may be cases that are undiagnosed, since many doctors would not think to test their patients for this disease."" Montgomery assured Americans the risk of infection is ""very low.""

Chagas disease can lead to life-threatening heart disease, health officials said. Most people who contract Chagas do not display any symptoms or only show mild, vague signs like fatigue, body aches and headaches.

""We think of Chagas disease as a silent killer,"" Garcia said. ""People don't normally feel sick, so they don't seek medical care, but it ultimately ends up causing heart disease in about 30 percent of those who are infected.""",2708

A minute later, dispatchers gave a description of the suspect. The officer encountered Brown at 12:01 p.m. Three minutes later, the shooting was over, and a second officer was on the scene, he said.

The chief said earlier in the week that the officer had been taken to a hospital with injuries to his face. He has been on administrative leave since the shooting. Jackson had declined for days to release the name of the officer, citing threats issued on social media.

Sharply different accounts of the shooting have been given previously by police and by Johnson.

Police have said that an officer encountered Brown and another man on the street. They have said that one of the men pushed the officer into his patrol car and that there was a struggle over the officer’s gun. They have said that Brown ran and the officer fired multiple times.

Johnson, however, told MSNBC that the officer ordered him and Brown off the sidewalk. He said that the officer tried to thrust his car door open but the door slammed into Brown and bounced closed. He said the officer then grabbed Brown by the neck, pointed the gun at him and said, “I’ll shoot.”

Johnson also said that the officer fired shots after Brown turned with his hands up and said, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!”

Another witness emerged Thursday and, in an interview with MSNBC, corroborated major details of Johnson’s account.

Johnson’s lawyer confirmed to MSNBC on Friday that Brown had taken the cigars from the store.

The unrest in Ferguson escalated and peaked on Wednesday night, when police fired tear gas into crowds of protesters and arrested 16 people, including two reporters. Police were criticized for a military-style presence that included officers atop armored trucks aiming rifles at crowds.

Relative calm was restored Thursday night after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon put the state Highway Patrol in command.

Nixon, in a statement on Friday, said he was pleased that the officer’s name had been released.

“For the sake of the family, the citizens of Ferguson, and the entire region, it is vital that the investigations into the shooting death of Michael Brown move forward in a thorough, open and transparent manner to ensure that trust is restored and justice is done,” the statement said.

516321020815228929,true,"Beheading Suspect Attended Same Mosque as 9/11 Terrorist: MOORE, Oklahoma -- Alton Nolen, the man who beheaded... http://t.co/NfpMkOW2eE",http://bit.ly/YxsMLD,True,Beheading Suspect Attended Same Mosque as 9/11 Terrorist,"MOORE, Oklahoma — Alton Nolen, the man who beheaded one woman and severely injured another at Vaughan Foods in Moore, Oklahoma, was apparently a radicalized Muslim. Nolen attended the same mosque as Zacarias Moussaoui, a man convicted in federal court of conspiring to kill U.S. citizens as part of the September 11 attacks, Breitbart Texas has learned.

Saad Mohammed, the Board Chair of Oklahoma’s Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Breitbart Texas that Nolen attended services at the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City (ISGOC) every Friday.

“He always sat in the back, he was very quiet and very low key,” Mohammed said. “Not someone you would notice right away. If you were to walk into an empty room, you wouldn’t have noticed him…He was a little odd, a little strange in the way he carried himself. But we [at the mosque] never made anything of it.”

Nolan first started attending ISGOC in May.

While Mohammed denies that his mosque encourages radicalization, he revealed that Moussaoui also attended ISGOC.

Mohammed recalled Moussaoui expressing a dislike towards non-Muslims. “I lectured a class that day, and [Moussaoui] said he disagreed with non-Muslims being in the Mosque,” Mohammed said. “We didn’t pay any attention because that’s just how some people think. But you know, look what happened. So we’re going to try to monitor for [strange behavior] more.”

At this point, however, it is unclear how ISGOC monitors alarming behavior.

Massaoui, who is a French citizen, is currently serving a life sentence without parole in Colorado. FBI reports show that in early 2001, Massaoui displayed odd, alienating behavior at ISGOC; he approached Suhaib Webb, the mosque’s former Imam, and asked, “Why don’t you tell the Muslims they should leave the land of the Infidel?”

Webb himself, and his history of radicalization, has also raised eyebrows. Webb, who now serves as Imam of the sister organization of the mosque attended by the Boston Bomber suspects, has ties to former Al Qaeda mastermind Anwar al-Awlaki.

“We do have people here who have an extreme way of thinking,” Mohammed admitted. “What I mean by that is [they think], ‘The way I practice Islam is right, you’re wrong. My school of thought is the best, your’s is a little shaky.’ We have that.”

Still, he insisted that “down with America” mindsets are not present at the mosque.

Referring to the recent incident involving Nolen, Mohammed said, “This is not something that’s going to be widespread. We’re going to keep our eye out for this.”

He added, though, that “it’s impossible to completely stop” violence, “because you don’t know what people are thinking.”

Today, word is getting out that the 5.5-inch phone may be vulnerable to unplanned situational curvature.

In other words, the phones are bending, and they’re not supposed to bend. They bend because people are putting them in their pockets, then sitting down, which is a reasonable thing to do. Call it Apple’s #Bendghazi, if you will. Or #Bendgate.

MacRumors highlighted the following forum post from a new iPhone 6 Plus owner:

Yesterday, I left at 10am with the iPhone in my left FRONT pocket of my suit pants. I drove 4 hours to a wedding, which also involved a lot of sitting during dinner etc but also 2-3 hours of dancing. I left at 2am and went to bed, driving home 4 hours back. So in total, the 6 Plus was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly. As I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive (yes, sitting again ), I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones slightly distorted.

Another user posted the following photo of his clearly bent iPhone:





What’s interesting about Bendgate/Bendghazi is that both of these MacRumors forum posters said they put their phones in their front pockets. Contrary to some reports, they weren’t “sitting on” their iPhones. They were sitting down. The phone molded to the shape of their thighs.

On Twitter, the story became a fight between those concerned about Bendgate and those dismissing it as a First World Problem that was easy to avoid.

Complaints from players' parents led to the uncovering of the fight club, as well as reports that Plano East High School head baseball coach Travis Collins and assistant coach Reagan Allen subjected players to demeaning, sometimes racist comments, according to documents obtained by The Dallas Morning News.

Injured players in particular were targets of coaches' comments, the document showed. One student told investigators, ""It was as if it was just a game to the coaches to see who could dish out the funniest nickname or phrase to ridicule the hurt player."" The document did not identify the student.

An attorney for the coaches, Giana Ortiz, said they ""vehemently deny"" the allegations regarding demeaning comments and assert that they had no knowledge of any fight club involving their players.

""They have dedicated their lives to the game they coach and to developing players through positive example and influence,"" Ortiz said.

However, investigators said the attention generated by the fights was so widespread that the coaches should have known of them, although they occurred while the coaches were away from campus for an annual conference.

The district found that the fights were promoted on social media and that players would come to class with bruised eyes and knuckles after the club fights.

Some players defended the coaches to The Dallas Morning News. Senior Devin Gifford said he never heard the coaches make demeaning remarks and that Collins and Allen cared for their players.

""They criticized us when we made mistakes and praised us when we did well,"" Gifford told the newspaper. ""They never pushed to make injured players play. I hurt my arm once and told coach (Collins) that it still hurt. He just told me to play when I felt ready.""

Dan Rudkin, whose sons played for the two coaches for seven years, said he had heard no complaints.

""I've never seen anything that concerned me in all my years with the team,"" he said. ""I never heard of a fight club, and I feel that if the coaches had, knowing them the way I do, they definitely would have done something about that.""

Both coaches are on paid administrative leave, and a district statement says neither coach is still associated with the baseball program.

Collins has been with the Plano school district since 2002, and Allen has been there since 2003. Their former players include Jake Arrieta, the 2015 National League Cy Young Award winner.",2661

The men were reported missing by the Massachusetts National Guard Saturday night at Joint Base Cape Cod. A statement identified the soldiers as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, 48, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, 18, and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar, 20.

""They have been found,"" the source said. The men were found near Rainbow Bridge, which spans New York and Ontario, but no other details were immediately available.

A federal source told MyFoxBoston.com the men were caught at the border on Monday.

Earlier, Pentagon officials who spoke to Fox News said they did not feel that the missing soldiers posed a public threat. U.S. military officials told The Associated Press that the men arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept. 11. They were last seen during a day off at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady told the Cape Cod Times that the men “had the freedom to come and go.”

""If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,” he said.

Base and exercise officials were working with local and state authorities to locate the soldiers, who were taking part in a U.S. Central Command Regional Cooperation exercise.

The exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

Col. George Harrington, battle group commander for the exercise, told the Cape Cod Times that the day the soldiers disappeared was a chance for participants to visit Cape Cod beaches and be treated to a traditional lobster boil back on the base.

This year's exercise, which involves more than 200 participants from six nations, including the U.S., wraps up on Wednesday. There are about a dozen Afghan soldiers still taking part in the exercise.

A Cape Cod Times reporter who attended a training exercise on Friday observed that none of the soldiers involved were carrying weapons.

This year is the first time the exercise has taken place on U.S. soil since 2006, the Cape Cod Times reported. The events are usually held in South Asia.

""This is a valuable opportunity for the Massachusetts National Guard and is personally rewarding,"" Harrington told the newspaper.

Five black and Latino teenagers were arrested.

Trump stepped in, denounced Mayor Ed Koch’s call for peace and bought full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty. The five teenagers spent years in prison before being exonerated. In retrospect, they suffered a modern version of a lynching, and Trump played a part in whipping up the crowds.

As Trump moved into casinos, discrimination followed. In the 1980s, according to a former Trump casino worker, Kip Brown, who was quoted by The New Yorker: “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. … They put us all in the back.”

In 1991, a book by John O’Donnell, who had been president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump as criticizing a black accountant and saying: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” O’Donnell wrote that for months afterward, Trump pressed him to fire the black accountant, until the man resigned of his own accord.

Trump eventually denied making those comments. But in 1997 in a Playboy interview, he conceded “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”

The recent record may be more familiar: Trump’s suggestions that President Obama was born in Kenya; his insinuations that Obama was admitted to Ivy League schools only because of affirmative action; his denunciations of Mexican immigrants as, “in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists”; his calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States; his dismissal of an American-born judge of Mexican ancestry as a Mexican who cannot fairly hear his case; his reluctance to distance himself from the Ku Klux Klan in a television interview; his retweet of a graphic suggesting that 81 percent of white murder victims are killed by blacks (the actual figure is about 15 percent); and so on.

Trump has also retweeted messages from white supremacists or Nazi sympathizers, including two from an account called @WhiteGenocideTM with a photo of the American Nazi Party’s founder.

Trump repeatedly and vehemently denies any racism, and he has deleted some offensive tweets. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi racist website that has endorsed Trump, sees that as going “full-wink-wink-wink.”",2650

Pretty much all the actors in Hollywood.

Nearly every category in which a nonwhite actor or ensemble was nominated at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Saturday night went to that candidate — the only exception being the final award, Best Film Ensemble, which went to Spotlight.

Of the 13 categories announced during Saturday night's telecast, seven had either nonwhite actors or diverse ensembles as nominees. Six of those won it: Idris Elba (twice), Queen Latifah, Viola Davis, Uzo Aduba and Orange is the New Black.

SEE ALSO: Every major celebrity who's commented on the Oscars diversity controversy

The run started with Orange is the New Black star Aduba's win for Female Actor in a Lead Role, Comedy, and the show's win for Ensemble, Comedy. Next was Elba, who was shut out from the Oscars but won the SAG for Beasts of No Nation. He was back onstage minutes later for his win for Male Actor in a Miniseries/TV Movie for Luther.

""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Diverse TV!"" Elba said early on in the telecast from Los Angeles.

In between Elba's wins, Queen Latifah beat out four white nominees for Female Actor in a Miniseries/TV Movie for the HBO special Bessie. ""Thank you my compadres, my brothers and sisters in the struggle,"" she said.

Viola Davis accepts the award for Female Actor in a Lead Role, Drama for her role in 'How to Get Away With Murder.'

Davis won Female Actor in a Lead Role, Drama for her role in How to Get Away With Murder, then spoke backstage about the unfolding #OscarsSoWhite controversy.

""We've become a society of trending topics,"" she said. ""Diversity is not a trending topic. ... I've always considered myself an actor, since I got my acting card in 1988. I never put any limitations on myself. I always felt I could play any character in Chekhov, in Shakespeare, in [Anne] Ridler, in August Wilson — I see myself as an actor, no matter what is going on in the business, I will find a way to practice my art and all the actors of color I know don't place any limitations on themselves regardless of what's going on with the Academy, regardless of what's going on in Hollywood.""

In the final and biggest category of the night, Film Ensemble, a win for Beasts of No Nation or Straight Outta Compton would've made it a clean sweep — but that prize would go to Spotlight, putting the story of the Boston Globe's investigation into the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandal back on track for the big Oscar.

(Photo: File/AP)

Jill Biden will visit Nashville Wednesday morning to talk with students at McGavock High School about their access to a tuition-free college education through Tennessee Promise and dual-enrollment courses.

Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, will be joined by Gov. Bill Haslam, Mayor Megan Barry and other officials during her 9:30 a.m. visit to McGavock, according to a statement from the White House. Ted Mitchell, U.S. undersecretary of education, and Randy Boyd, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, also will attend.

The visit comes as the U.S. Department of Education is accepting applications for a new experiment that will invest up to $20 million to improve high school students' access to college coursework, the White House statement said. The funding will allow up to 10,000 high school students from low-income families to use federal grants for dual-enrollment college courses during the 2016-17 academic year.

While in Nashville, Jill Biden also will host a meeting of the College Promise National Advisory Board, a bipartisan panel that advocates for free community college and improved college access. Boyd, who was a dominant force in the formation of Tennessee Promise and Haslam's Drive to 55 effort to increase the number of Tennesseans with a college education, is a member of the board.

Tennessee has become a national leader in college access in recent years, largely because of Tennessee Promise, the first statewide scholarship program in the country to offer graduating high school seniors the chance to attend community or technical college tuition-free. Biden visited the state in 2015 along with President Barack Obama to celebrate what he called ""the great work that's been done"" in Tennessee.

State leaders also have invested in dual-enrollment programs, which bring college-level courses to high schools. A $10 million grant program that rolled out in late 2014 put college-level mechatronics in high schools in Montgomery County and other school systems across the state.

According to a December report from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, 1,591 high school students took dual-enrollment college courses that were funded or enhanced by the Labor Education Alignment Program grants. The same report urged lawmakers to provide added funding and attention during this year's legislative session.

407212665350942720,true,'Fast and Furious' Cast Mourns Paul Walker's Death http://t.co/vAN2PaMYje,http://on.mash.to/1hreljf,True,'Fast and Furious' Cast Mourns Paul Walker's Death,"As details of Paul Walker's sudden death continue to unfold, the 40-year-old actor's Fast and Furious costars mourned his passing on social media.

Walker died Saturday in a car crash in Santa Clarita, Calif. Leaving a charity event, he was riding in the passenger seat of a Porsche Carrera GT, when the driver lost control. The car slammed into a post or a tree, and burst into flames, according to a report.

Walker was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner, a police officer in five of the soon-to-be seven films in the Fast and Furious franchise. He co-starred alongside Vin Diesel, who expressed his grief on Instagram, saying he was ""absolutely speechless.""

In one of his last interviews before the crash, Walker told USA Today on Monday that fans addressed him more often by his signature character's name than by his real name — so much so, in fact, that he felt more comfortable when identified as his Fast and Furious alter ego.

""I'm Brian a lot more than I'm Paul Walker, which is awesome,"" Walker told the newspaper. ""When I hear, 'Hey Paul Walker!' my hair stands up on the back of my neck. It's uncomfortable. But when I hear 'It's Brian!' it's cool. I like Brian.""

The tight-knit cast expressed their condolences to Walker's family via social media.

Perhaps the most heartbreaking of all is a screenshot of a text exchange between Walker and co-star Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, a childhood friend of O'Connor's in the films.

Gibson shared their last conversation on Instagram, adding, ""At least I got to say I love you.""

Rapper Ludacris, a long-standing Fast and Furious cast member who plays Tej Parker, another friend of O'Connor's, shared a photo of the cast on Instagram.

""Your humble spirit was felt from the start, wherever you blessed your presence you always left a mark, we were like brothers & our birthdays are only 1 day apart, now You will forever hold a place in all of our hearts @paulwalker legacy will live on forever. R.I.P.,"" the photo's caption said.

The 40-year-old actor, who died in a car accident yesterday (Nov. 30) in Santa Clarita, Calif., attended a charity event for his organization, Reach Out Worldwide, just hours before the tragic crash. He was reportedly ""so happy"" to be at the ""Winter Drive"" -- a toy drive for Philippines Typhoon victims.

Bill Townsend, who was at the event, took the below photograph with the late actor shortly before he drove off in the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that crashed while his friend, Roger Rodas, was driving. Rodas, 38, also died in the accident, which took place at approximately 3:30 p.m. The Los Angeles County Fire Department extinguished the car fire, but both Walker and Rodas were found dead at the scene.

""The early news reports that Paul Walker has died. I was just with him no more than 2 or 3 hours ago. Talking cars, he was so happy seeing all his friends get together to look at the cars. I hope it wasn't him in the wreck, but if it was, he would have passed doing something he loved, which is driving cars,"" Townsend wrote on Facebook following the news of Walker's death. ""The world lost an angel in Paul. He dedicated so much of his life to helping disadvantaged kids and people who are in need, with his charity recently assisting those in the tornadoes in the Midwest and the trauma in the Philippines. Just today we had hundreds of toys donated for kids, all apart of Paul's charity. If this sad news indeed true I'm going to do whatever I can to keep Pauls goals for the charity alive.""

""He had been so happy,"" Townsend added to E! News of the ""Fast and the Furious"" star's mood that day. ""He was there at the event and had managed to raise thousands and so many people had brought toys. So many people had come out to support the charity and he was with his friends. It was a great day for him. He was so overwhelmed to have so much support.""

Walker had been gearing up the past few months to reprise his role as Brian O'Connor in ""Fast and the Furious 7,"" which is set for a 2014 release date. He was also set to promote his new film ""Hours,"" out Dec. 13.

“All of us at Universal are heartbroken,” Universal, who worked with Walker on the ""Fast and the Furious"" films, said in a statement. ”Paul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family for 14 years, and this loss is devastating to us, to everyone involved with the Fast and Furious films, and to countless fans. We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul’s family.”",2576

NY Times via YouTube The families of murdered American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff are speaking out against the US government for making their efforts to free their loved ones a ""helpless"" endeavor.

The parents of Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who was kidnapped by militants in Syria, told Yahoo News on Friday that a member of the president's National Security Council threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to pay a ransom to get their son freed.

""The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this,"" Barak Barfi, a friend of Sotloff who is serving as a spokesman for his family, told Yahoo News. ""The Sotloffs felt there was nothing they could do to get Steve out.""

Sotloff's mother, Shirley, recorded an emotional video directly addressing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in late August. Despite her plea for mercy, the group murdered her son one week later.

The claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foley's mother Diane, in which she said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by the US government's handling of her son's case.

In the interview, Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do, including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal — ""we might be prosecuted,"" Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him.

""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" she said. ""And he wasn't, was he?""

Diane Foley. CNN/screenshot

Jim Foley, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria, was brutally murdered in mid-August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq.

""It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted ... "" Diane Foley told ABC News. ""I'm sure [the US official] didn't mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing … meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day.""

The US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley, Sotloff, and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, although the special operations troops were unable to locate any of them. The Wall Street Journal reported the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid.",2570

Ferguson fatal police shooting and popular protests - TIMELINE

At the same time, 37 percent of Americans do trust the justice system, while 19 percent are undecided.

The poll also found that 43 percent think police violence with the use of lethal force happens too often in the US, while 32 percent disagreed with the statement.

The reaction to Brown’s fatal shooting on August 9, and the protests of thousands of people that followed, was different, depending on the political beliefs and ethnicity of the respondents.

Democrats were three times more likely to speak out against deadly police violence than Republicans, the poll found.

Sixty-nine of black Americans thought the officers used lethal force too frequently, while only 37 percent of white Americans thought so. Over 65 percent of black US citizens don’t trust the justice system to deal with the guilty, while 40 percent of the white population don’t believe in the system either.

When asked if the police treat the black population more severely than the white population, 53 percent agreed, while 31 percent said police officers treat everyone the same.

Minorities in the US usually express mistrust toward law enforcement officials: for instance, a Gallup poll carried out last year revealed that the white population is 12 percentage points more likely to be confident of the police actions than the non-white population.

The poll was conducted August 11-14 among 1,000 US adults, 116 of them black, using a sample chosen from YouGov’s online panel. Factors taken into account were: age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance, HuffPost said.

The poll follows an escalation of violence after the killing of Brown, 18, by a white police officer. During the protests, police used rubber bullets and tear gas, and detained several journalists.

The latest accounts of justifiable homicide reported to the FBI stated that almost twice a week in the US a white policeman killed a black person – that’s over a seven-year period that ended in 2012. An average of 400 police killings a year were reported, with 96 percent of them involving a black person as the victim, USA Today reported.",2564

Paul Walker, best known for starring in the popular Fast and Furious franchise, died Saturday in a car accident in Valencia, California. He was 40.

It would be difficult to make the case that Walker was a particularly influential or exceptional actor. But he was a fine action star and was decent in his heavier dramatic fare. But beyond his on-screen credentials, all available evidence suggests that Walker was, up until the moment he died, a celebrity who genuinely cared about the world around him—someone who used his celebrity for worthy causes.

According to a statement posted to the actor’s Facebook fan page, Walker died “in a tragic car accident while attending a charity event for his organization Reach Out Worldwide.”

Reach Out Worldwide, formed by Walker in 2010, is a 501(c)(3) that provides rescue and recovery aid in the wake of major natural disasters. The group supplements rescue efforts with its own team of paramedics, doctors, and search-and-rescue professionals. Reach Out Worldwide has lent its services to disaster-relief efforts in the Philippines, Alabama, Indonesia, Chile, and Haiti. “I’d made a few runs into Port-au-Prince and was negotiating with the army to give me baby formula, tents, extension cords,” Walker told the Daily Telegraph, an Australian tabloid newspaper, in 2011. “I was hustling for everything.”

Here’s his explanation for why he started Reach Out Worldwide:

Because of my travels with work and pleasure, a lot of the times disasters would strike in areas that I’d been. You think of the faces—they might not be people you’re in contact with but you can’t help but wonder how that family was you had dinner with. That stuff starts crossing your mind and you feel so helpless. I would be consumed with anger, like, “Fuck! I wanna be there, I wanna do whatever I can.” One of my best friends had heard it too many times and ultimately he just held me accountable. He punked me out: “So you gonna pack your bags and go to Haiti and help out or what?”

“When the shit hits the fan,” Walker continued, “that’s when you actually see the best in people.”

Hours, one of the last films Walker starred in, is scheduled for a mid-December release. It’s a fitting send-off for Walker: The film is set in a hospital in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, with Walker playing a father desperately trying to protect his newborn daughter.

But you’re not more likely than your dumber counterparts to actually want to do anything about racial inequality.

Whites with higher cognitive ability are simply more sophisticated racists than their counterparts with lower ability.

That’s the finding of a new study that looked at nearly three decades of answers to the General Social Survey, a survey that asks about attitudes on everything from government spending, to the existence of God, to race. By giving a short vocabulary test–something that’s a pretty good predictor of how well someone will do on a longer IQ test–the data shows roughly how smart someone is. From there, it’s possible to see how intelligence changes what someone thinks about race.

People who score lower on the vocab test are much more likely to hold racist stereotypes and say black people are “lazy” or “unintelligent.” They’re also more likely to disapprove of intermarriage, and not to want a black family living next door.

Smarter respondents disagreed, but held similarly racist views when it came to actual government policy. Almost everyone with higher verbal scores agreed that “whites have no right to segregate their neighborhoods,” for example. But half of those say they wouldn’t vote for a law designed to prevent prejudice in real estate transactions.

And while 95% of the “smarter” group say that black and white children should attend the same schools, only 22% support school busing programs. The lowest-scoring people actually support busing programs a little more (27%).

“I was most surprised by the finding that individuals with higher cognitive abilities were no more likely–on average–than individuals with lower cognitive abilities to support even the most benign opportunity-enhancing policies designed to remedy racial inequality, such as non-discrimination laws in the housing market, despite reporting significantly lower levels of overt prejudice,” says study author Geoffrey Wodtke, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto.

PBNJ Productions/Getty Images

Among researchers, there are two competing theories about intelligence and racism. Some believe that prejudice is born out of ignorance and narrow-mindedness; the smarter you are, the theory goes, the better you can handle complex information without resorting to simple stereotypes. Several studies seem to support this idea.",2541

1. Banksy isn't from Liverpool

He's from Bristol according to his Wikipedia.

2. There's no London Police force

There's the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police, both used interchangeably in the article.

3. There's no London Police Chief called Lyndon Edwards

We call them The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. And he is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

4. Police don't release pictures of people being arrested

Nope. They definitely don't do that.

5. Met Police don't cover the Watford area.

That's Hertfordshire Police's job.

6. The website it comes from is full of spurious stories

Other headlines on the site include 'Kanye West applies for refugee status' and 'Miley Cyrus replaced by double in 2010'.

7. The same article was circulating last year as a press release

Before Banksy was Paul William Horner a 39 year old, rather than Paul Horner, a 35-year old.

8. The picture of him being arrested is from Notting Hill Carnival 2012

Put that picture URL into Google images and you get pictures from Carnival.

9. And as if you needed any more proof, Banksy's PR has confirmed it is a hoax

Nevertheless it looked real enough to fool many people - including former Tory MP Louise Mensch.

But it's definitely a hoax, Banksy's secret is still safe for now. Everyone back in your boxes until the next rumour appears.

Banksy’s real identity has been a closely kept secret ever since his work emerged in 1992.

Initially it was rumoured he was born Robin Banks, a former butcher.

However, more recently people believe he could be Robin Gunningham, who enjoyed a middle-class upbringing in Bristol.

During a rare interview he was described as “a cross of Jimmy Nail and British rapper Mike Skinner”.

Banksy has also claimed his parents think he is a painter and decorator.",2537

It's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally.

One 22-year-old protester told Quartz's Lily Kuo that she had never heard of the events in Ferguson. Another said that the similarity was coincidental, a result of protest leaders telling people to raise their hands to police to signal peacefulness. Still, Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use, even if only subconsciously.

The death Saturday of actor Paul Walker, known for his work in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise as well as earlier roles in ""Varsity Blues,"" ""Pleasantville"" and other films, left the world stunned. While fans process the tragedy and police unravel the Santa Clarita, Calif. car accident that took the life of the 40-year-old Walker, studio executives at Universal have the unhappy decision of what to do with the car-centric franchise Walker was so widely recognized for.

As is the case with any death, there are obligations and entanglements to be sorted through on behalf of the deceased. Walker was in the midst of filming ""Fast & the Furious 7,"" due to be released July 11, 2014. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the cast and crew had taken a Thanksgiving hiatus, and were scheduled to resume filming in Atlanta on Sunday, Dec. 1. Instead, director James Wan (a newcomer to the franchise) and Universal execs held a conference call to discuss the future of the movie and how to work around Walker's untimely death.

No announcements have been made about a rewrite, change in release date, recasting, digital face replacement or any of the other possible workarounds used in the past when an actor died mid-production. In the very early hours of Sunday morning, Wan tweeted that he was ""beyond heartbroken.""

I am so beyond heartbroken right now. I can't process anything. — James Wan (@creepypuppet) December 1, 2013

Universal released a statement Saturday night: ""All of us at Universal are heartbroken,"" it said. ""Paul was truly one of the most beloved and respected members of our studio family for 14 years, and this loss is devastating to us, to everyone involved with the

Fast and Furious films, and to countless fans. We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul's family.""

The official ""Fast and Furious"" Facebook page posted an image of Walker leaning against a car, captioned ""always in our hearts.""

Walker has been involved in the franchise from the very beginning; 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"" revolved around his undercover cop character, Brian O'Conner, attempting to worm in with a ring of fast-driving, law-bending criminals.

The earliest that production on ""Fast 7"" would resume is Tuesday, sources told Buzzfeed Entertainment. The cast, including Walker, was reportedly also scheduled to meet in Abu Dhabi in January to film additional scenes.",2512

A food testing authority using cutting-edge genetic testing has found human DNA in some samples of hot dogs, and meat was found in a shocking number of vegetarian substitutes.

Clear Food, a company that genetically tests food products, analyzed 345 hot dogs and sausages from 75 different brands, and found that 14 percent had hygienic issues or had ingredients that were not displayed on the product label.



Two percent of the samples tested positive for human DNA, and a whopping 66 percent of vegetarian hot dogs contained evidence of such contamination.

“One thing's certain: questions about the hot dog are as old as the hot dog itself. And they're not wholly unwarranted,” the report said.

Other shocking findings involved vegetarian meat substitute products. Ten percent of vegetarian hot dogs and sausages were found to contain meat. Evidence of chicken was found in 10 samples, beef in four samples, turkey in three samples, and lamb in two samples that were supposed to be meat-free.



Pork is a particular concern as an unlabeled substituted ingredient, due to dietary prohibitions in Islam and Judaism. Pork substitution was reported to be an issue in products across the price spectrum being sold at a wide variety of retailers. Clear Food found pork substitution in 3 percent of the samples that were tested. In most cases, pork found its way into chicken and turkey sausages.

The company noted that while the issues they were raised are not necessarily violations of FDA rules, they are providing a service to help people make decisions based on their own preferences, not that of a government regulator.

“While some of these substitutions, hygienic issues, other variances, or off-label ingredients may be permitted by the FDA, our scientific disclosure allows you, as the consumer, to decide whether the variance or problems meet your personal standard in your buying decision,” Clear Food said.",2506

Step one: back off  https://t.co/Jue9yeyfT0 https://t.co/W7yD2rq7H9",http://nyti.ms/1Sscn3q,True,Opinion | How to Raise a Creative Child. Step One: Back Off,"Even then, though, parents didn’t shove their values down their children’s throats. When psychologists compared America’s most creative architects with a group of highly skilled but unoriginal peers, there was something unique about the parents of the creative architects: “Emphasis was placed on the development of one’s own ethical code.”

Yes, parents encouraged their children to pursue excellence and success — but they also encouraged them to find “joy in work.” Their children had freedom to sort out their own values and discover their own interests. And that set them up to flourish as creative adults.

When the psychologist Benjamin Bloom led a study of the early roots of world-class musicians, artists, athletes and scientists, he learned that their parents didn’t dream of raising superstar kids. They weren’t drill sergeants or slave drivers. They responded to the intrinsic motivation of their children. When their children showed interest and enthusiasm in a skill, the parents supported them.

Top concert pianists didn’t have elite teachers from the time they could walk; their first lessons came from instructors who happened to live nearby and made learning fun. Mozart showed interest in music before taking lessons, not the other way around. Mary Lou Williams learned to play the piano on her own; Itzhak Perlman began teaching himself the violin after being rejected from music school.

Even the best athletes didn’t start out any better than their peers. When Dr. Bloom’s team interviewed tennis players who were ranked in the top 10 in the world, they were not, to paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, doing push-ups since they were a fetus. Few of them faced intense pressure to perfect the game as Andre Agassi did. A majority of the tennis stars remembered one thing about their first coaches: They made tennis enjoyable.

SINCE Malcolm Gladwell popularized the “10,000-hour rule” suggesting that success depends on the time we spend in deliberate practice, debate has raged about how the hours necessary to become an expert vary by field and person. In arguing about that, we’ve overlooked two questions that matter just as much.

First, can’t practice itself blind us to ways to improve our area of study? Research reveals that the more we practice, the more we become entrenched — trapped in familiar ways of thinking. Expert bridge players struggled more than novices to adapt when the rules were changed; expert accountants were worse than novices at applying a new tax law.",2498

The 38-year-old musician was traveling with his father in West Bend, WI, where he was due to perform at a charity event for veterans.

He had been rehearsing early Saturday morning for the "" Rockin' for Heroes "" benefit event at a local restaurant, said his father, Darrell Roberts.

The father said he often traveled with his son, and last saw him outside his hotel room.

""We go up to our room, we got adjoining rooms and -- he was always looking after me as his dad -- so my key didn't work and he went and came back in just a few minutes and got me a new key. He opened the door for me and he said 'just make sure you open the adjoining room in case you need anything.' He was always looking out for me,"" Roberts said.

Unknown cause of death

Roberts says detectives woke him up Saturday to tell him Matt had passed away.

""I was wakened at 8:50 this morning by some detectives beating on my door. It's always scary as a parent, they were in suits and that's when they told me. They asked me if Matt Roberts was your son, I said yes, and they said 'we have bad news to tell you, Matt deceased last night,'"" Roberts said.

West Bend police received a call Saturday that a man was ""either asleep or passed out in the hallway of his hotel,"" a statement from the department says.

He was later declared dead. The department has not determined the cause of death and an autopsy is scheduled.

Struggle with drugs, anxiety

Darrell Roberts said his son had struggled with anxiety and an addiction to prescription medication since his time with 3 Doors Down.

""I know he had prescription drug addiction. He suffered greatly from anxiety. It's crazy as a performer; he never liked crowds or liked places he didn't know about as a baby, as a child, and this was his way of dealing with it and me and him talked about it often,"" Roberts said.

Matt was not in treatment for his addiction but his father believed he was doing much better.

""I thought he had beaten it all,"" he said.

Roberts planned to attend the event his son was scheduled to perform and inform the crowd about his death.

""That's what he would have liked, he put all this energy and effort to come out here to perform. I'll put his guitar on stage and light it up and I'm going to say thanks to everybody and leave and go home in the morning,"" he said.

Reuters In April, a BMW racing through a fruit market in Foshan in China's Guangdong province knocked down a 2-year-old girl and rolled over her head. As the girl's grandmother shouted, ""Stop! You've hit a child!"" the BMW's driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl. The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time. When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: ""Don't say that I was driving the car,"" she said. ""Say it was my husband. We can give you money.""

It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true — it's fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: ""It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure.""

This 2008 television report features security-camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat's back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Security-camera footage. Screen grab Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother's body. He then speeds away from her corpse.

Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao's claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for ""negligence."" Zhao's case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, ""You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one."" ""Double-hit cases"" have been around for decades. I first heard of the ""hit-to-kill"" phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near miss of a motorcyclist, he said, ""If I hit someone, I'll hit him again and make sure he's dead.""",2477

Since parting ways with One Direction less than a year ago, Zayn Malik has dropped several hints about what to expect from his newly-minted solo career. He spoke about adopting a more R&B-influenced sound. He pursued an edgier aesthetic. He craved authenticity and creative control. And damn it, he wanted to sing about sex.

Well, turns out he really wasn’t kidding about that last bit. Despite the forewarning that this was going to be a “dirty and raw” debut, Zayn’s first solo single, “Pillowtalk,” eclipses all expectations for just how libidinous his music could be. The loud, sexy track has F-bombs and heavy beats galore, but Zayn's vocals stand front and center, shining on one hell of a towering chorus.

Zayn released “Pillowtalk” and its accompanying video late Thursday night, less than 24 hours after revealing the title of his upcoming album, Mind Of Mine, in an interview with Beats 1. In that same interview, the 23-year-old was curiously tight-lipped about his rumored girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, murmuring something about being “good friends.” But, uh, you can go ahead and squash any leftover doubts you may have had about their coupledom, because #Zigi is here. #Zigi is now.

In the vid, Zayn and Gigi navigate a kaleidoscopic paradise and war zone, where they make out, make up and cry black tears as Zayn sings, ""So we'll piss off the neighbors/ In the place that feels the tears/ The place to lose your fears/ Yeah, reckless behavior/ A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw/ Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day/ F--king you, and fighting on/ It's our paradise and it's our war zone.""

YouTube

In an interview with Sunday Times Culture magazine earlier this week, Zayn described “Pillowtalk” as “so pure, so dirty and raw” (little did we know he was actually quoting the song at the time), adding that he’s not glazing over its explicitly sexual theme.

“I think I'm pretty black and white about what it's about,” he said. “Everybody has sex, and it’s something people wanna hear about. It’s part of everybody’s life, a very big part of life! And you don’t wanna sweep it under the carpet. It has to be talked about.”

Though “Pillowtalk” is the first full single we’ve heard from Zayn, a snippet of a new song called “Befour” was previously featured in a video accompanying his Fader magazine profile. Both tracks are expected to appear on Mind Of Mine, which is due to arrive March 25 (exactly one year after leaving 1D).",2468

“In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways,” Target announced April 19. “Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.”

Target common stock dropped from opening price of $83.50 per share April 19 to a closing price of $79.99 per share May 3—a 4.2 percent decline over the past two weeks. Its closing price of $83.98 on April 19 was the highest since July 2015.

“Target’s policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims,” the American Family Association, a nonprofit that supports Christians values, wrote April 20. “And with Target publicly boasting that men can enter women’s bathrooms, where do you think predators are going to go?”

The group continued in an updated website message:

Clearly, Target’s dangerous new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters. Over 1 million people agree with us and pledged to boycott Target stores until protecting women and children is a priority.

More than 1.15 million consumers have signed the American Family Association’s pledge to boycott Target, the “best response” the organization says it has had to a campaign in a short amount of time.

“Target stocks are dropping. They started dropping the day we announced this boycott,” Sandy Rios, the group’s director of government affairs, told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon.

The American Family Association suggests that Target keep restrooms for males and females separate, but also have a single occupancy, unisex restroom available.

YouGov’s BrandIndex tracked data that shows Target’s consumer perception went down after the transgender bathroom announcement.

“I don’t think it’s a statement that people aren’t in favor of equal rights for transgender people,” YouGov CEO Ted Marzilli told USA Today. “It shows people just kind of demonstrating that they’re uncomfortable, or uncertain about how comfortable they are, with mixed public restrooms.”

Reporter Charlo Greene quit on live TV during a broadcast last night on KTVA in Anchorage, Alaska. She helmed a segment, her very last segment, on the Alaska Cannabis Club last night, which is apparently the state's only medical marijuana resource. Its website adds that its business model ""finds a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws, Alaska's constitutional protections and current local and state marijuana laws factored in."" In other words, it acts as a go-between.

And it turns out Greene is the club's CEO — a fact she had apparently not disclosed in any pre-show reporting [via Dazed & Confused]. As the cameras rolled, she outed herself, saying she plans to ""[dedicate] all my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska."" ""And as for this job,"" she continued, noticeably nervous and a little emotional, ""not that I have a choice, but fuck it – I quit."" Greene then walked off camera, and that was that. The camera quickly panned to a rather flabbergasted anchor who apologized for the profanity, and cut to a commercial.

The Alaska Cannabis Club's Facebook page had prompted its followers to tune in for the show, though apparently no one knew of Greene's dramatic plans. (It's worth noting her phrasing — ""not that I have a choice"" — suggests her resignation may have been preceded at least by some newsroom politics/unpleasantness.) She has now launched an Indiegogo fundraising page to raise money, and awareness, for her cause. There, she writes:

As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand. Here's the sad thing: it's working. Polling shows the majority of Alaskans, who were in favor of the initiative at the start of the year, are now against it. Few people fighting for marijuana legalization in Alaska are as media savvy, well educated on the marijuana industry, passionate, professional and completely dedicated to passing this initiative as me, the only person in Alaska that has had the balls to face the injustice of Alaska's medical marijuana catch-22 and do something about it.

693284114724700160,non-rumor,Boeing wins contract to build new Air Force One presidential jets https://t.co/can13F4fjN https://t.co/mUTY25mLKQ,http://reut.rs/1SPgwjn,True,Boeing wins contract to build new Air Force One presidential jets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) has won a contract to start preliminary work on a new fleet of Air Force One presidential aircraft based on its 747-8 jumbo jet, the Pentagon said on Friday.

The U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing an initial contract worth $25.8 million to reduce risk and lower the cost of the program by looking at the tradeoffs between the requirements and design of the new plane, according to the Pentagon’s daily digest of arms deals.

Details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets.

The Air Force first announced in January 2015 that Boeing’s 747-8 would be used to replace the two current Air Force planes used to transport the U.S. president. Air Force One is one of the most visible symbols of the United States.

The Air Force plans to modify the contract in coming years as the Air Force One program moves into the engineering and design phase, and later, into production.

The Air Force now operates two VC-25s, specially configured Boeing 747-200Bs, which are nearing the end of their planned 30-year life.

In January, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the Air Force One program would use proven technologies and commercially certified equipment to keep the program affordable.

The Air Force decision was widely expected since the only other suitable four-engine jet is the A380 built by Airbus (AIR.PA) in Toulouse, France.

The 747-8 is the only four-engine commercial jet Boeing makes, providing an extra margin of flight safety over the more standard twin-engine planes.

Boeing last week said it would cut production of the 747-8 in half in September and take a $569 million charge in the fourth quarter as it faces dwindling sales.

The four-engine jet is now mostly a cargo workhorse, eclipsed by more fuel-efficient twin-engine jets for passengers.

The double-decker plane entered service in 1970, undergoing a major overhaul in 2012, with new engines and a longer fuselage.",2427

HUBBARD, Iowa — Senator Ted Cruz is often asked about doing away with President Obama’s health care law. He is rarely pressed by voters on what will replace it.

But at a middle school cafeteria here, a man, Mike Valde, presented him with a tragic tale. His brother-in-law Mark was a barber — “a small-business man,” he said. He had never had a paid vacation day. He received health insurance at last because of the Affordable Care Act. He began to feel sick and went to a doctor.

“He had never been to a doctor for years,” Mr. Valde, 63, of Coralville, Iowa, said. “Multiple tumors behind his heart, his liver, his pancreas. And they said, ‘We’re sorry, sir, there’s nothing we can do for you.’ ”

The room was silent.

“Mark never had health care until Obama care,” Mr. Valde continued. “What are you going to replace it with?”

Mr. Cruz expressed condolences and pivoted quickly to a well-worn answer assailing the health care law.

Mr. Cruz said “millions of Americans” had lost their jobs and their doctors as a result of the law, and that many had “seen their premiums skyrocket.”

He said he had often joked about a pledge by Mr. Obama that premiums would drop: “Anyone whose premiums have dropped $2,500, as President Obama promised, should vote for Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Cruz said. “I’ll take everybody else.”

Many in the room laughed.

Mr. Valde — who said in an interview later that he did in fact intend to caucus for Mrs. Clinton — pressed on.

“My question is, what are you going to replace it with?” he said.

Mr. Cruz said he was getting there, but had to lay out the problems with the law first. “There are millions of stories on the other side,” he said, describing voters who had liked their insurance plans and lost them because the plans did not provide the level of coverage the new law required.

He went on to describe elements of his plan, which includes an effort to allow people to purchase insurance across state lines.

Mr. Cruz turned back to Mr. Valde. “Your father-in-law, he couldn’t afford it,” he said.

“Brother-in-law,” Mr. Valde said.

“Your brother-in-law couldn’t afford it,” Mr. Cruz said.

“Right,” Mr. Valde said. “But he could afford it — he finally got it under Obama.”

“He would have gotten it earlier, if he could have afforded it earlier,” Mr. Cruz said. “But because of government regulations he couldn’t.”

Moments later, Mr. Cruz wrapped up and Mr. Valde sat down.",2425

See the varieties affected: http://t.co/9f7Y0pdrOR,http://cnn.it/1c2EpuB,True,School lunch supplier shut by USDA reopens; some Hot Pockets recalled,"Story highlights USDA had closed meat plant that supplies federal nutrition programs

The meat plant, closed for 'insanitary conditions' reopened Wednesday

In separate action, Philly Steak and Cheese Hot Pockets may contain recalled meat

No illnesses have been reported in relation to the recall

A California meat company suspended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture because of ""insanitary conditions"" is operating again, the agency said Wednesday.

""On Monday,(the Food Safety and Inspection Service) suspended operations at Central Valley Meat Co. due to insanitary conditions at the establishment,"" the agency said in a statement Wednesday. ""After the company took corrective actions to address the issue, the suspension was lifted, and the plant has resumed operations.""

The Central Valley Meat Co. in Hanford, California, supplies beef for federal school nutrition programs. In 2011, it provided nearly 21 million pounds of beef, or nearly 16% of the supply.

Meanwhile, Nestlé USA has issued a recall of two varieties of Philly Steak and Cheese Hot Pockets because they may contain meat the department has already recalled.

The two brands are Hot Pockets brand Philly Steak and Cheese in three different pack sizes, and Hot Pockets brand Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese in the two-pack box.

For the exact batch code, please check this release

Earlier, the USDA said the Rancho Feeding Corp. had recalled more than 8.7 million pounds of meat products because it ""processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection."" The Hot Pockets may contain some of this meat.

No illnesses have been reported in relation to the recall.

According to Nestlé, consumers should return the products to the place of purchase for a full refund or contact Nestlé consumer services at 800-392-4057.

In August 2012, Central Valley Meat was closed while the USDA investigated what it called ""disturbing evidence of inhumane treatment of cattle"" at the supplier following its receipt of a video from an animal welfare group.

However, the USDA said at the time the video found nothing that would compromise food safety.

Central Valley Meat was cleared to reopen a few days later after the USDA said the company ""committed to a number of corrective actions, including additional humane handling training for employees and safeguards.""",2413

(Photo: Getty)

An audio recording released Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer Aug. 9.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest.

CLOSE Michael Brown's funeral put a focus on the teen's faith as family and friends remembered their last moments with him. KSDK

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organization Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organization's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

A press conference is set for 1 p.m. CT Tuesday at the U.S. District court building in St. Louis.

Rachel Weber Senior Editor Tuesday 9th September 2014 Share this article Share

Companies in this article Microsoft Mojang

Update: Mojang founder Markus ""Notch"" Persson may have instigated the negotiations with Microsoft, after reaching out to the company several months ago.

Many within the games industry and the games press have reacted with surprise at the possibility of Microsoft acquiring Mojang, not least because Persson has been openly critical of the company in the past. However, Bloomberg's sources have claimed that Persson actually proposed the deal in the first place, largely due to a ""positive working relationship"" and a ""close relationship"" with Xbox boss Phil Spencer.

According to Bloomberg, Persson will remain at Mojang to see the deal and subsequent merger through to completion, but will likely depart once that has happened.

Original Story: Unconfirmed reports suggest that Microsoft could be about to secure a massive deal with the purchase of Minecraft studio Mojang.

Neither Mojang or Microsoft have made any public announcement regarding the story but the Wall Street Journal cites ""a person with knowledge of the matter"" who claims the sale is worth $2 billion and could be signed and sealed this week.

The news is unexpected, Mojang has always seemed to be a company that prided itself on its independence with Minecraft creator Markus ""Notch"" Persson as its outspoken leader.

In March it was revealed that Mojang made $129 million in profit in 2013, so it's not hard to see why Microsoft might be interested.

GamesIndustry.biz has contacted Mojang for clarification and will update this story as it develops.

514395350615203841,true,Reporter Charlo Green quit on air to start a marijuana business http://t.co/vkDUy6nn8P Will quitting on TV pay off? http://t.co/ESEzaE312o,http://bbc.in/1sVVZrF,True,#BBCTrending: Will anchor who quit succeed in business?,"Media playback is unsupported on your device

Old and new media came to a head in Alaska this week: a local news reporter presented an edited package on the evening news about the campaign to legalise marijuana, then revealed her identity as the owner of a medical marijuana business.

Then, with the cameras rolling, she quit her job, uttered a profanity, and walked off the set, leaving the anchor stunned and fumbling before a commercial break.

Ethical issues aside, Greene's sign off is having a bigger impact on social media than any local news spot could. More than two million people have seen the video on YouTube. Twenty thousand people have tweeted about it, and it's made headlines across the globe.

But one business consultant wonders if it will have lasting impact.

""Just because something is viral doesn't mean it's paying the bills, and that's a really important point,"" says Peter Shankman, author of Can We Do That?! Outrageous PR Stunts That Work.

""She might have seven million Facebook views tomorrow, but guess what? No one's buying her stuff, because they're all outside of Alaska,"" he says.

While Greene's stunt was being discussed on CNN, her Indiegogo fund to raise $5,000 to campaign for Alaska's marijuana legalisation act had barely made it past the halfway mark. She had yet to raise the full amount by the end of the business day on the East Coast.

While the stunt will be the first thing that pops up when someone searches for her online, the Twitter feed for her business, Alaska Cannabis Club, has fewer than 700 followers and its Facebook page has less than 6,000 - that's more than two-thirds fewer than the Facebook page of KTVA, the news station she quit in spectacular fashion.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Despite a day of publicity Greene's Twitter feed stayed below 1000 followers

In the meantime, her immediate community - and her client base - may have questions about credibility.

""I don't think she was thinking long term,"" Shankman says. ""This was a very short term play.""

Comments online indicate that the renegade spirit she showed in quitting is appreciated by fans of marijuana culture. Whether that translates to more customers or more votes for pro-pot legislation remains to be seen.

Some bodies found in shallow graves near the Mexican town of Iguala are not those of students missing after clashes with police, the state governor says.

The 43 students were last seen being pushed into police vans after a protest in Guerrero state on 26 September.

""I can say that some of the bodies, according to the work of forensics experts, do not correspond to the youths,"" said Governor Angel Aguirre.

Prosecutors believe police turned over the students to a drug gang.

The gang was linked to the family of Iguala's Mayor Jose Luis Abarca Velazquez.

He, his wife and his head of security went on leave after the clashes and have not reappeared.

A formal search has been launched for them.

Mr Aguirre has promised new developments in the investigation over the next few days.

""I have big hopes of finding our young students alive. That is why we have now entered a new phase in the search for them,"" he said.

The clandestine graves were located in the outskirts of Iguala following an anonymous tip off.

Twenty-eight burnt bodies were retrieved from the pits. Forensic experts are still working to identify all of them, said Mr Aguirre.

'No impunity'

The students all attended a local teacher training college with a history of left-wing activism.

Six students were killed in two separate shooting incidents during the protests in Iguala, which lies some 200km (120 miles) south of the capital, Mexico City.

But it is not clear whether they were targeted for their political beliefs.

Some think that they may have angered a local drug gang called Guerreros Unidos by refusing to pay extortion money.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets across Mexico to demand government action to locate the students.

President Enrique Pena Nieto went on national television to promise to identify and punish those responsible for the disappearance.

He described the incident as ""shocking, painful and unacceptable"" and said there will be ""no impunity"".",2364

Serial killer Levi Bellfield has admitted abducting, raping and killing 13-year-old Milly Dowler for the first time, according to Surrey Police.

Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl.

He made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice, police said.

Milly's family described the news as ""devastating for a family which has already had to endure so much"".

Surrey Police revealed it had arrested a man in his 40s who has since been released without charge.

Detectives from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team made the arrest following new information regarding an accomplice being involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly Dowler.

They said no evidence had been found to support that claim.

Image copyright PA Image caption Levi Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and killing Milly Dowler

In a statement issued through solicitors, Milly's family said they had been made aware of the recent arrest and Bellfield's admission.

Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.

Tom Symonds, BBC home affairs correspondent

Bellfield wasn't arrested and charged until detectives connected him with two other horrific murders - those of Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange and the attempted murder of a young woman called Kate Sheedy.

But this admission today makes little difference.

Despite admitting what he's done, he is serving what is called a whole life tariff - so he will never be released.

Milly's body was later found 25 miles away in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died.

Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a ""cruel and pitiless killer"".

He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly.

Bellfield, who now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004.",2307
715515982584881152,unverified,Craigslist Ad: ‘Get Paid $15 an Hour to Protest at the Trump Rally’ - https://t.co/uPbXy6zD2Q https://t.co/1sY7Sf6zoA,http://www.infowars.com/craigslist-ad-get-paid-15-an-hour-to-protest-at-the-trump-rally/,True,Craigslist Ad: ‘Get Paid $15 an Hour to Protest at the Trump Rally’,"A pro-Bernie Sanders Craigslist ad invites people in Wisconsin to protest against Donald Trump for $15 dollars an hour.

Beneath an image of a Bernie Sanders T-shirt, the ad, which was posted on Tuesday morning, reads, “Paid positions for protesters at the Trump rally.”

“Shuttle buses, parking, signs, and hourly pay available. $15 an hour due to economic inequality. Meet at 3300 W. Tripp Road, Jainesville, WI 53548 for pre-protest instructions and to get your time card.”

But is the ad genuine?

One respondent on Facebook noted that the meet-up location was 10 miles from the site of Trump’s event at the Jainesville Holiday Inn.

While that’s true, it’s still only a 16 minute drive, which is presumably why transportation was offered to bus the protesters to the rally.

The sight of protesters being paid right in front of Trump supporters would also be something that organizers would obviously be keen to avoid.

Google maps shows that the meet-up spot, 3300 W. Tripp Road, is a parking lot in a remote location.

The Craigslist ad was subsequently deleted after it began to receive attention on pro-Trump forums.

Whether the ad is real or not, we know that at least some anti-Trump protesters were recruited via a Craigslist ad before the march at Trump Tower in New York City earlier this month.

Writing for the Daily Caller, former Trump advisor Roger Stone revealed, “Infiltrating the crowd, I learned most were from MoveOn or the Occupy movement. Soap was definitely in short supply in this crowd. Several admitted answering a Craig’s list ad paying $16.00 an hour for protesters.”

MoveOn, which is funded by billionaire George Soros, also took credit for causing the cancellation of Trump’s rally in Chicago back on March 11 after hundreds of Bernie Sanders supporters infiltrated the event and staged violence which the media later blamed on Donald Trump.

Following the riots in Chicago, left-wing groups vowed to stage mass civil disobedience at Trump rallies across the country beginning in April.

Follow RT’s LIVE UPDATES on Fukushima leak emergency



The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which is responsible for decommissioning the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, on Saturday said the protective barriers that were installed to prevent the flow of toxic water into the ocean are no longer coping with the groundwater levels, Itar-Tass reports.



The contaminated groundwater, which mixes with radioactive leaks seeping out of the plant, has already risen to 60cm above the barriers – the fact which TEPCO calls a major cause of the massive daily leak of toxic substances.

Earlier on Friday, the company announced it started pumping out contaminated groundwater from under Fukushima, and managed to pump out 13 tons of water in six hours on Friday. TEPCO also said it plans to boost the pumped-out amount to some 100 tons a day with the help of a special system, which will be completed by mid-August. This will be enough to seal off most of the ongoing ocean contamination, according to TEPCO’s estimates.

However, Japan’s Ministry of Industry has recently estimated that some 300 tons of contaminated groundwater have been flowing into the ocean daily ever since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the disaster.

TEPCO also promised it will urgently reinforce the protective shields to keep radioactive leaks at bay. The company has repeatedly complained it is running out of space and has had to resort to pumping water into hastily-built tanks of questionable reliability, as more than 20,000 tons of water with high levels of radioactive substances has accumulated in the plant’s drainage system.

Water samples recently taken at an underground passage below the Fukushima nuclear plant showed extreme levels of radiation comparable to those taken immediately after the March 2011 catastrophe. The tested water, which had been mixing with ground water and flowing into the ocean, contained 2.35 billion Becquerels of cesium per liter – some 16 million times above the limit.",2243

Missing Afghan Soldiers Caught Trying to Enter Canada,"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise on Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls, officials said Monday.

A top Massachusetts law enforcement officials told NBC News that the three were caught at the famed Rainbow Bridge. It was unclear what the process will be to return them to Joint Base Cape Cod or if they will be returned somewhere else.

The Massachusetts State Police later said in a statement that the men were being interviewed by federal authorities, and there was ""no information that suggests the three men committed any crimes.""

The three arrived 11 days ago with 200 soldiers and civilians from several countries for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. They were last seen Saturday at a shopping mall in Hyannis during a day off. Massachusetts State Police, with the help of the FBI and the Guard, had been trying to find them.

Col. Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, had told NBC News earlier, ""There's no reason to think they have nefarious intent, and no information to suggest that public safety is in question. But there's a pause for concern, because we want to make sure this wasn't planned, and we want to see if anyone has helped them."" He said because the men have visas that remain valid for the next several days, they're in the country legally.

Several officials said the widely held view is that they were trying to find some way to not go back to Afghanistan. It's possible the men were trying to cross into Canada to take advantage of the country's more liberal asylum policies.

Their disappearance follows an apparently similar event last week when two policemen from Afghanistan went missing during a DEA training program in the Washington area. They were found in New York. Earlier this month, a senior Afghan military officer slated to carry the flag for his country at a NATO summit in Wales applied for asylum in the United Kingdom upon his arrival.

Following the tragic death of Paul Walker in a fiery car crash on Saturday afternoon, additional details about the circumstances surrounding the accident continue to emerge.

TMZ spoke with a man reportedly on the scene just after the crash, one of a number of friends and employees that arrived to find the car engulfed in flames. ""They were stuck. They were trapped,"" he said. ""We were trying with extinguishers to put out the flames.""

""I could see him,"" the man said of Walker. ""He was unconscious.""

Firefighters then arrived at the crash site. Once the flames were extinguished, firefighters found two occupants, both of whom were pronounced dead at the scene.

Walker also posed for a photo with the red Porsche Carrera GT reportedly involved in the crash about 30 minutes before the accident.

Photos from the scene, near Kelly Johnson Parkway in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, California, show the horrific wreckage from the accident.

The 40-year-old Walker was a passenger in the Porsche, which collided with a light pole and a tree. The driver was said to be Roger Rodas, a friend of Walker's and the owner of Always Evolving, a performance shop for high-end automobiles. arial footage from the scene appeared to show the wreckage wrapped around a tree and a downed light pole.

At the time of the accident, Walker was taking part in a charity event for his organization Reach Out Worldwide, a group dedicated to aiding in rescue and recovery after major natural disasters around the globe. Saturday's event was intended to benefit the victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Earlier in the day, a photo of the Porsche said to be involved in the crash was posted on Facebook.

The road near the crash site showed burned rubber and doughnut marks. ""I don't know if the marks in the road are related to the crash,"" said Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Brian Allen.

Bannon on the AFA’s Target boycott, which now has the support of more than 1.2 million families.

Asked about what is ultimately behind efforts like the one at Target and others being advanced by the Obama administration, Rios said:

We have a push from the left to deconstruct everything that’s called normal. And that includes sexuality. It’s part of the Marxist theory to deconstruct the family and to recreate new systems. And so, I’m not saying everybody that’s doing this has read Marx and is doing Marx’s bidding, but we know that that was at least one of the beginnings of this sexual anarchy.

Added Rios:

I think it’s also interesting to note now the Justice Department is also coming down on North Carolina, threatening them that if they don’t change that law by Monday, the government’s going to withhold money, or whatever the threat exactly is, they’re going to do something.

Rios justifiably sees it as part of a much broader theme with the current administration:

And remember Robert Gates was interviewed recently on his thoughts about the military under President Obama, and he made the statement that he had not seen the President excited, or really enthused, about any policy–anything they discussed in terms of strategy, except for gays in the military. And Robert Gates said this on television, that that was the thing that was most important to the President of the United States. And I can only say that the Obama Justice Department and Education Department are now forcing schools around the country–maybe in a quiet way for some–forcing schools to adopt this policy of allowing children who think they’re boys or girls, whatever they think they are, to be able to use bathroom and bathing and changing facilities in public schools. School boards are losing this battle all over the country because they’re afraid to lose funding. So this is definitely a priority for this administration.

Almost 1.2 million signatures are currently on the petition at AFR.net.

According to flight data, the aircraft was flying at altitude just before the crash, at roughly 33,000 feet.

To take down a plane at these heights would require an advanced air defense system; the Ukrainian Interior Ministry says the separatists who fired the shot were armed with a Russian-made Buk missile launcher.

The Buk, also known as the SA-11, is a medium-range mobile missile platform that can engage targets flying at altitudes well above MH17's last reported figures — by some estimates, as much as 72,000 feet. Newer versions of the Buk are known as the SA-17; here's a video of one in action.

Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko told Interfax Thursday that the Ukrainian army is not equipped with the SA-11, which raises questions about where the separatists may have gotten one (if that's in fact what they used). For their part, rebel leaders deny having any Buk missile launchers. But other militia members told Russian state media last month that they had ""taken control"" of a number of SA-11s.

Another possibility? Man Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADS. These are lighter and can be carried by a single person. In fact, separatists have been using shoulder-fired missiles for weeks to shoot down other aircraft, according to aviation specialist David Cenciotti. But even the most advanced MANPADS have a limited ceiling compared to bigger missile platforms. The SA-18, which the separatists have reportedly used before, has a maximum altitude of 11,000 feet.

On top of the plane crash itself, it appears we now have a puzzle concerning the provenance of the weapons that caused it.

Update: U.S. officials have confirmed that MH17 was downed by a surface-to-air missile, according to The Post's own Ernesto Londoño.

A study of both meat and vegetarian hot dogs showed that they contain unadvertised ingredients - including human DNA.

More worryingly - unless you are a hardcore vegetarian who would rather eat people than pigs - the company found human DNA in 2% of its hot dog samples, and in two-thirds of the vegetarian samples.

It's probably not human flesh you're ingesting along with your porky treat - the researchers claimed that the human DNA most likely came from hygeine issues, so saliva and other bodily fluids along the production line.

The company also found nutritional label inaccuracies, pork substitution and some unexpected ingredients, including chicken and lamb.

Clear Food used 'genomic technology' to examine foods by ingredients, analysing 345 hot dogs and sausages from 75 big U.S. brands at 10 retailers.

The report said: ""Sausages are the world's original 'mystery meat' and hot dogs have always provoked ingredient anxiety.

""In mid-19th century America, rumours circulated that some butchers made inexpensive frankfurter-style sausages with ground dog meat.

""This might explain how the hot dog got its name.""

Melinda Wilkins, a professor at Michigan State University who also specializes in food safety, spoke to CNN about the report.

She said: ""The use of genetic analysis in this type of setting is actually fascinating,

""I think we're going to see a lot more of this type of analysis happening, seeing how well food content matches food label.""

However, she would also like more information, particularly on the finding of ""human DNA.""

""When you're working with genetic material, depending on the analytic technique, you can detect a very, very small amount of DNA that's not supposed to be in there,"" she said.

""So this accusation of finding human DNA in there, you can detect a very small amount, but they're not quantifying the amount. It could be just a few cells versus a percentage content.""

This study was done in America, so UK readers can relax somewhat, although it would not be surprising if they found similar results in our sausages - remember 2013's horse meat scandal?",2215
535148463609356288,unverified,This Russian kid got zapped by a faulty electrical wire and now he's a real-life Magneto http://t.co/R6K8muhVeY http://t.co/vxTH7yqG38,http://nyp.st/1wYVqiX,True,"Meet Magneto Boy, the kid who attracts metal with his body","Every superhero has an origin story, but one Russian boy’s unbelievable tale isn’t from a comic book — it’s very much real-life.

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

“When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,” Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before, but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me,” he said.

Naturally, Nikolai’s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn’t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

“I could even hang a ladle on my nose,” said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

“There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,” said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 “human magnets” in 1990.

Extending her arms out, Marinela Brankova was able to support a 15-pound weight from her vertically turned palm, according to the book “Far Out: 101 Strange Tales From Science’s Outer Edge” by Mark Pilkington.",2208

Does he really?,"Forget Magneto. A schoolboy in Russia claims an electric shock left him with super powers to attract metal, like the X-Men character.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko says he leant against a faulty lamp post and he was hit by a blast of electricity.

Since then he's been able to stick metal objects all over his body, he told Russian GTRK TV.

""When I got out of bed the next day I found some coins that had been on the mattress stuck to my body.

Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.""

He says he's a fan of the Marvel comics and Magneto - who can generate magnetic force fields.

But Nikolai says it's not just forks, spoons and coins that stick to him, he's found sometimes his powers extend to other things too.

He said: ""I get this skill even when I don't want it. For instance, a glass didn't stick to me, but moved by itself to me once. ""

Magneto boy v Science adult The schoolboy claims he's a human magnet. Dr Roy says: ""Wow! But it's not possible.""



He says it happened after an electric shock. Dr Roy says electricity can't magnetise the body.



He claims metal objects are attracted to his skin. She says: ""It must be glue.""

And he says he's become really popular at school.

The GTRK report shows his friends trying to stick metal objects all over his body.

But how likely is it that he could be a real-life Magneto?

Doctor Ipsita Roy is a specialist in microbial biotechnology at the University of Westminster and says it's not.

She told Newsbeat: ""There's no way he could become magnetic after an electric shock. Electricity can't magnetise the body.""

So, it goes without saying, don't try this at home.

But also Dr. Roy says there must be another reason his skin is attracting objects.

""Either he's eaten something which makes him magnetic, which would naturally pass out of the body quickly anyway,"" she says.

""Or he could have something attached to his body which isn't visible. Or it could be glue.""

But Nikolai wants to become a real Magneto when he's older, especially if it means he can use his powers to help people.

""I'm thinking of becoming a superhero now,"" he added.

Science via Isaac Newton. He had some excellent theories, but probably never would’ve assumed I’d use them to describe a giant corporation’s missteps. But here we are. With over one million people boycotting Target since it decided to allow men to use the women’s bathroom if they claim to identify as women, we can’t help but notice that the companies stock is going down ever since. Coincidence? Hardly.

Target’s stock has dropped and more than 1 million consumers have pledged to boycott the retail giant after it announced an “inclusive” policy allowing individuals to use the restroom or fitting room of their choice, based on their gender identity. Target common stock dropped from opening price of $83.50 per share April 19 to a closing price of $79.99 per share May 3—a 4.2 percent decline over the past two weeks. Its closing price of $83.98 on April 19 was the highest since July 2015.

Coincidence right? Nope.

What goes up must come down… Since Target said men are totes fine in the ladies room, their stock is not doing so well. It’s trending downward. Actions have consequences. Target told parents their daughter’s feelings don’t matter as much as a man who may be feeling like a woman. He doesn’t even have to look like a woman. He can just say he feels uncomfortable in the men’s room, as exposed with this hidden camera story.

Target can set any SJW policy they darn well please. That’s there prerogative. On the flip side, customers can choose to shop elsewhere if they’re not loving the co-ed bathroom love. Maybe try Walmart, where now even rude customers can lecture people for their life choices, even if they’re terrible. If you’re a business, you generally want to give people a reason to shop in your store. Not give them a reason to shop elsewhere. But Target wanted to score some points with the vocal left, who occupy a small minority. What they may now be experiencing is the reaction to that decision.

Target. It made it’s gender fluid bed, now it’s sleeping in it. With a lot fewer customers.

Protesters took to the streets when a St. Louis grand jury chose not to charge police officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of Brown.

Police also claim someone tried to run down an officer, who fired at the car fearing for his safety. Turns out, Conner was struck. Doctors were unable to save her left eye and Conner reports blurry vision in the other.

“My sister can now only see one side of things – literally,” Conner’s sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, told KMOV. “I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.”

Conner said she and her beau were just bystanders caught up in an unfortunate situation.

Now she’s disabled and police have issued a warrant for her boyfriend’s arrest.

Man Has Sex With Hornet's Nest: Top Five Hoax News Stories



The bizarre story of a man who died after trying to have sex with a hornet's nest has been exposed as a hoax.

The tale of the man known as 'Hasse' said to have been found dead with 146 sting marks on his body, including 54 to his genitals, was first published by News Sweden.

His body was found by a neighbour in the town of Ystad, who, according the spoof online publication, said Hasse was so swollen he initially mistook him for a whale carcass.

Hasse was unconscious when he was found but died an hour later from the injuries he sustained, claimed the story - which was never officially verified.

A London newspaper took up the story claiming a neighbour Bertil Ståhfrääs (who's name transalates as 'erection' in Swdish) said: ""At first [I thought he was lying there by] of choice, so I called 'Hasse' to ask what the hell he was doing.

""I walked up to the body and then I recognised his tattoo on his neck.

""I have never in my life seen such a swollen pelvic bone. It hid the whole package [and] the scrotum was enlarged. Right now it feels heavy and unreal. We did not talk very often, but he was still my neighbour.""

A supposed autopsy of Hasse's body allegedly showed semen on some of the dead wasps and a number of the victim's pubic hair was found at the entrance of the nest. His fingerprints were also found on the nest, leading the police to believe he had been trying to have sex with the hornet's nest when he was stung to death.

""To attempt to have intercourse with a hornet's nest is a very bad idea,"" Siv Underlivh, a psychologist and expert on sex fantasies told the news website. Underlivh was also a play on words, meaning 'fetish' in Swedish.

""I don't even think about the pain he must have suffered both within himself [from his fetish] and incurred by the wasp attack.""

Hornet stings are more painful than typical wasp stings because of their venom. They can also sting multiple times.

The stings are not normally fatal to humans unless a person is allergic to their venom, in which case they can go into anaphylactic shock.",2185

He had fought in Syria with al-Nusra front before joining so-called Islamic State, Morocco said.

French police raided a flat in the Saint-Denis district of Paris five days after the attacks, searching for the suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national. He and his cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen died in a fierce gun battle during the raid.

A third person who died during the raid, detonating a suicide bomb, was named by the Paris prosecutor's office last week as Chakib Akrouh, a Belgian-Moroccan national, born in Belgium in 1990. He was identified using DNA from his mother.

Both Akrouh and Abaaoud had spent time in Syria.

Superman. Doomsday. It’s safe to say that both Gotham and Metropolis’ skylines are in danger of being drastically rearranged again in Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice. The two great DC superheroes are the twin cover stars of this month’s Empire. Inside is reams of coverage and world-first pictures from the blockbuster, a few of which we’re able to debut right here.

Kicking off is Henry Cavill’s flying Kal-El trailing blazing destruction behind him. Not only will Superman and Batman be clashing, but their alter egos, Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne, will also be at loggerheads: one a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist; the other, an investigative journalist on the trail of Gotham’s Bat-shaped vigilante. It will end badly for someone.

“[Batman] is not giving people a chance,” explains producer Charles Roven. “He is more than a vigilante. He has become not only the cop, if you will, he has also become the jury and executioner.” Here he’s also a man with very glowy eyes.

For his part, the Dark Knight is experiencing his own share of (dark k)nightmares. The picture below shows the horrors now haunting the psyche of a character who, Roven stresses, will be markedly different from the Christian Bale iteration. “He’s older,” stresses the producer, “[and] he’s seen the worst of what man can do.

Publication does not imply endorsement of views by the World Economic Forum.

“If it has to happen, then it has to happen first,” writes Laura Vanderkam, a time-management expert and the author of “What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast.”

Those among us who have managed to find professional success and eke out a life actively embrace this philosophy. They must set aside their first hours of the day to invest in their top-priority activities before other people’s priorities come rushing in.

Science supports this strategy. Vanderkam cites the famous finding of Roy Baumeister, a Florida State University psychology professor, that willpower is like a muscle that becomes fatigued from overuse.

Diets, he says, come undone in the evening, just as poor self-control and lapses in decision-making often come later in the day. On the other hand, early mornings offer a fresh supply of willpower, and people tend to be more optimistic and ready to tackle challenging tasks.

So what do successful executives and entrepreneurs do when they are rested and fresh? From Vanderkam’s study of morning rituals and our own research, we outline the following 14 things that the most successful people do before breakfast. While they might not do all of these things every morning, each has been found to be an effective way to start the day.

They wake up early. Successful people know that time is a precious commodity. And while theirs is easily eaten up by phone calls, meetings, and sudden crises once they’ve gotten to the office, the morning hours are under their control. That’s why many of them rise before the sun, squeezing out as much time as they can to do with as they please. In a poll of 20 executives cited by Vanderkam, 90% said they wake up before 6 a.m. on weekdays. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, for example, wakes at 4 a.m. and is in the office no later than 7 a.m. Meanwhile, Disney CEO Bob Iger gets up at 4:30 to read, and Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey is up at 5:30 to jog. The bottom line: Productive mornings start with early wake-up calls.",2139

As Team USA works on bringing home the gold, President Obama and the First Lady looked back at a few of their favorite golden moments from Olympics-past in a presidential pop quiz. Watch:

This weekend, President Obama joined Americans across the country in wishing our Olympic and Paralympic athletes the best of luck and thanked them for representing what's best in America:

When you watch these Games, remember that it’s about so much more than the moments going by in a flash. Think about the countless hours these athletes put in, knowing it could mean the difference in a split-second victory that earns them a lifetime of pride, and gives us enduring memories. It’s about the character it takes to train your heart out, even when no one’s watching. Just hard work, focus, and a dream. That’s the Olympic spirit – and it’s the American spirit, too

Watch:

This year, the Opening Ceremony in Rio celebrated the culture of Brazil but also took the opportunity to remind the world the threat and challenges climate change pose to people around the world, including athletes. A few athletes -- Olympians among them -- came to the White House today to discuss exactly how climate change is impacting the world of sports.

Merkel, who enjoyed record high popularity ratings early last year, has grown increasingly isolated in recent months as members of her conservative bloc have pressed her to take a tougher line on asylum seekers and European allies have dragged their feet on the issue.

Responding to popular pressure, Merkel's conservatives and their left-leaning Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners agreed on Thursday to tighten asylum rules, reaching a compromise on how to stem the influx of migrants.

The Insa poll for Focus magazine surveyed 2,047 Germans between Jan. 22 to Jan. 25. It showed 45.2 percent believed Merkel’s refugee policy was not a reason for her to resign. It was the first time the pollster had asked voters whether Merkel should quit.

Another poll released on Friday, by the Elector Research Group, showed support for Merkel’s conservative bloc steady at 37 percent. As recently as September, they were on 42 percent. Support for the SPD was also unchanged, at 24 percent.

The poll put the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), which supports a hard line on immigration, on 11 percent.

The three ruling parties - Merkel’s Christian Democrats, their Bavarian allies, and the SPD - are eager to show voters that the government is in control of the refugee crisis before three state votes in March and a general election next year.

The work was created on the side of a building near the docks in the English city of Bristol, but by Tuesday morning the mural had already been defaced with a splatter of black paint.

The mural, entitled Girl with a Pierced Eardrum (2014), parodies Johannes Vermeer’s masterpiece Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) and features a yellow outdoor alarm box as the girl’s earring. The artist published a series of photographs of the new work on his website, without commenting on the fake story about his arrest and outing as a mid-aged British man named Paul Horner.

On Monday a story published on the satirical American news website National Report claimed that London’s Metropolitan Police had arrested the artist on charges of “vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting.” The false arrest reports that his studio had been raided by Police turned out to be recycled story from a previous hoax.

The Girl with the Pierced Eardrum (2014) follows Banksy’s recent pieces Art Buff (2014), in Folkestone, England, which was vandalized only weeks after appearing (see “Phallic Addition to Folkestone Banksy Mural“), and Birds of a Feather (2014) which was removed by the local government who deemed it to be racist (see “Immigration-Themed Banksy Mural Destroyed by Local Council“).

It is the second time this year the artist has graced his hometown of Bristol with a Banksy original. Shortly after Mobile Lovers was unveiled on Banksy’s website, it was controversially snatched by the leader of a local youth club hoping to keep his struggling organization afloat (see “Youth Club Removes New Banksy with Crowbar“). The artist later gave the club his blessing, and it was sold to benefit the group (see “Banksy Gives Controversial Mobile Lovers Artwork to Bristol Youth Club” and “Sale of Banksy’s Mobile Lovers for $670,000 Saves Youth Club“).

534409916560461825,false,A world without chocolate?! Two of the world's biggest chocolate makers could face a shortage: http://t.co/5KBVD1kxKs http://t.co/33NxtTxNa7,http://cbsn.ws/1viGSjb,True,A world without chocolate? Confection giants sound the alarm,"Are the holidays going to be a little less sweet this year?

The world's cocoa supply - for decades in trouble - could soon be reaching a breaking point. Two global chocolate giants, Mars, Inc. and Barry Callebaut, are warning that global demand for one of the world's most popular commodities will outpace supply by one million metric tons by 2020, Bloomberg reports.

As CBS Moneywatch reported last month, Ebola has been the most recent culprit. West Africa produces nearly three-quarters of the world's cocoa -- with Ivory Coast and Ghana responsible for 60 percent of that supply. Those nations' proximity to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- the epicenters of the Ebola outbreak -- have fueled worries that the virus could ultimately stall production, and trigger another spike in world cocoa prices.

Also threatening the global supply of cocoa is severe drought in Africa. The lack of rain has continued to wreak havoc on crops in Ivory Coast and Ghana. That means smaller, lower-quality cocoa beans that must be processed more to yield the same amount of chocolate.

The International Cocoa Organization estimates that pests and diseases - with menacing names like Witches' Broom and Frosty Pod Rot -- have cut up to 40 percent of global cocoa production. The former fungus was responsible for wiping out cocoa production by almost 70 percent in Bahia, Brazil over a 10-year period, the group said.

Demand has risen - in part fueled by growing desire for the treat in China and increasing demand for dark chocolate. According to the Washington Post, demand officially surpassed supply in 2012 and cocoa prices have soared more than 60 percent since then.

""If prices rise at a greater rate, chocolate manufacturers will pass the increase onto consumers,"" Andrew Rolle of Juremont, a major Australian importer of chocolate ingredients, told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""It's a fragile market there at the best of times. There will be labor issues with the cocoa farmers in the fields, political issues, transport issues with accessing stock through ports.""",2066

The Daily Beast has published an account from Henry Davis, who was wrongly arrested in Ferguson in 2009, allegedly beaten severely by four officers, and then charged with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms.

Davis had gotten lost on his way to St. Charles, MO and pulled over in Ferguson because he couldn't see through heavy rain. A Ferguson police officer who had pulled up behind Davis reportedly mistook him to be another Henry Davis (with a different middle name and Social Security number), who had an outstanding warrant. The arresting police officer allegedly took Davis' cell phone out of his hand, cuffed him, and placed him in the back of a patrol car without explanation.

Once Davis was at the Ferguson jail, he was allegedly assaulted by four officers, who slammed him against a wall, hit him, and kicked him. Davis was taken to a nearby hospital, where he refused treatment. He spent several days in jail before posting a $1,500 bond on four counts of ""property damage.""

In a subsequent civil trial brought by Davis, the Ferguson police officers' complaints that Davis had transferred blood to their uniforms were revealed to not just be bizarre, but trumped up (and remember, the whole incident happened because Davis was wrongfully arrested in the first place). However, a federal magistrate ruled that the apparent perjury was too minor to constitute a violation of due process, and Davis' injuries were too minor to constitute excessive force.

The trial is currently in appeals, and Davis' lawyer James Schottel now believes that the previous minimal ruling might be seen differently in the context of Michael Brown's death.

An animal shelter is trying to track down the owner who abandoned a young Shar Pei at a railway station in Scotland, leaving him leashed to a rail with a suitcase full of his belongings.

The Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), an animal welfare charity, said the wrinkly-faced crossbreed was discovered last Friday at Ayr railway station. His suitcase was packed with a pillow, a toy, some food and a bowl.

The dog was microchipped, so the charity was able to find the dog’s name, Kai. The group was also able to track Kai’s previous owner whom the microchip was registered to.

His previous owners said they sold him on the classified ads website, Gumtree, in 2013. The were unable to provide the charity with the address of the person who bought Kai.

If found, the owner could be charged under Scotland’s Animal Health and Welfare Act.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said the case highlights the unfortunate consequences of selling an animal online.

“Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible,” he said “If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.”

The Scottish SPCA said Kai is a “lovely dog with a nice nature”, and estimate that he is between two to three years old. The charity said it will care for the dog until they find him a permanent home.

Ben Supple, a spokesman with the charity, told the Guardian on Tuesday afternoon that the prospect of Kai finding a loving home looks promising.

“We haven’t as yet found a home for Kai though we’ve been inundated with offers and will ensure we find him the right owner,” Supple said.

Anyone with information about Kai is urged to contact the charity’s animal helpline at 03000 999 999.",2063

The domestic terrorists who seized the Malheur national wildlife refuge near Bend, OR, are operating with incredible impunity, destroying public property, breaking into federal databases and disrupting sites of archaeological and sacred indigenous interest.

Though the terrorists sometimes face criminal sanctions for theft of public property when they venture out of their armed compound, their ideological leader, Ammon Bundy, has been able to come and go freely from the site, even after reports of the destruction surfaced.

The terrorists have paved a new road through the refuge, over territory that is considered archaeologically significant; the reserve itself encompasses many Paiute burial sites that the band holds sacred.

The terrorists claim to be there on the Paiute's behalf. Paiute band leaders do not want their help, and are outraged at the disruption of their traditional lands by a racist terror-cell.

Regarding the wildlife refuge, the Burns Pauite Indian tribe and federal government officials said they were worried about possible damage to cultural resources, artifacts, sensitive records and local wildlife habitats. The US Fish and Wildlife Service strongly condemned the occupiers for building the new road. “It’s deplorable,” spokesman Jason Holm said in an email. “I’m not sure what part of the [occupiers’] interpretation of the constitution promotes the destruction and desecration of culturally significant Native American sites … This is disgusting, ghoulish behavior.” Holm also said the fish and wildlife service had received reports that the occupiers were accessing federal records at the refuge, raising concerns about a possibly dangerous data breach. He said the government was now contracting with a data protection and credit monitoring service to safeguard refuge employees whose personal data may have been compromised.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE

""Big Bank Hank,"" a member of the Sugarhill Gang whose 1979 hit ""Rappers Delight"" created a lasting worldwide culture phenomenon, died Tuesday of complications from cancer, according to David Mallie, who manages the other two Sugarhill Gang members. Jackson was 57.

Born Henry Lee Jackson in the Bronx, ""Big Bang Hank"" and his bandmates Michael ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien introduced hip-hop to mainstream audiences with their epic 14-minute anthem that, decades later, still drives listeners to sing along and dance.

Remember the line, “I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere""?

Or ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""

Or the foretelling: “They say that miracles never cease, I’ve created a devastating masterpiece.""

Those were all Jackson.

""He was loud! He was a Ralph Cramden, Fred Flintstone kind of a guy,"" Wright said in an interview with NBC News. ""He was kind of a nut, very animated. He was either a good friend, or you didn’t want to get on his bad side. He was a big guy.""

Jackson parted ways with the Sugarhill Gang in 2005 when he decided to stay with the label and had not seen his former bandmates until last year when he was diagnosed with stage four liver cancer, Wright said. Wright and O'Brien visited Jackson in the hospital with other current members of the band.

""There were six of us in the room laughing and carrying on,"" Wright said. ""I said to Hank right there, 'The beef between you and our crew is over.'"" And we squashed it right there and that’s the last time I talked to Hank.""

""Rappers Delight"" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame this year. The Sugarhill Gang members were all unknown MCs when Sugar Hill Records recruited them to perform the song for the label.

""We’re going to miss him, but I do have the memories and I do have a lot of photos and we do have our history,"" Wright said.",2062

Her death is being treated as a suicide. Several sources refer to Leelah as a boy in their coverage of her death, and Leelah wrote in her note that she never felt she'd be able to transition successfully:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.

Her death is being treated as a suicide. Several sources refer to Leelah as a boy in their coverage of her death, and Leelah wrote in her note that she never felt she'd be able to transition successfully:

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I've had enough. I'm never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I'm never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I'm never going to find a man who loves me. I'm never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There's no winning. There's no way out. I'm sad enough already, I don't need my life to get any worse. People say ""it gets better"" but that isn't true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse.

That's the gist of it, that's why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that's not a good enough reason for you, it's good enough for me. As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don't give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights.

Activists say up to 10 people have died from malnutrition since the delivery; more than 20 died before it arrived

Experts have repeatedly warned that residents will continue to starve unless consistent aid is allowed in to the town

The video in this story is difficult to watch, but CNN believes it is important that people see it. We have verified the images in it were shot recently in the town of Madaya, but cannot independently confirm the medical issues of those featured in it

(CNN) The world's attention may have moved on, and the aid convoys driven away, but in besieged Madaya, now caught in the bitterly cold grip of ice and snow, people are still starving.

Ten days since the last aid convoy brought emergency relief to the rebel-held Syrian town, which remains surrounded by pro-government forces, activists have smuggled out video they shot, showing the continuing suffering of emaciated adults and children trapped there.

Aid workers say up to 10 people have died from the effects of long-term malnutrition since the last convoy arrived in Madaya; more than 20 died before the aid was delivered , they say. Experts have repeatedly warned that the people of Madaya will continue to starve unless consistent medical and food aid is allowed in.

A doctor in the town's makeshift hospital, in the basement of a house, said that one woman named Lama Issa died Monday from acute malnutrition, after not responding to treatment with intravenous drips; a man was also said to have died. CNN cannot independently confirm their deaths.

Newton and Curry both have had incredible seasons (in Curry's case, both last season and this season). Newton is chasing what Curry already has-- an MVP award (which Newton could win next Saturday) and a championship (which Newton could win next Sunday). It might be a stretch to compare a football quarterback with a basketball ""quarterback"" but we can find a few ways in which the two compare:

• Newton became the first player in NFL history with 3,000 passing yards and 500 rushing yards in five straight seasons.

Curry became the first player in NBA history with 200 3-pointers in four straight seasons.

• Newton became the first player in NFL history with 30 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns in a single season.

Curry is on pace to become the first player in NBA history with 300 3-pointers in a single season (on pace for 396).

• Newton led the NFL with a combined 45 passing (35) and rushing (10) touchdowns this season.

Curry creates 45.2 points per game (29.9 points, 15.3 points from assists), second in the NBA behind Russell Westbrook (45.6).

• Newton led all quarterbacks with 10 rushing touchdowns and was one shy of matching four running backs for the NFL lead.

Curry leads the NBA with 87 unassisted 3-pointers.

• Newton threw an NFL-best 19 touchdowns when facing a blitz this season.

Curry makes 49.5 percent of his contested catch-and-shoot field goals, third-best out of 76 players with at least 75 such shots.

• Newton had a 78.9 Total QBR in the fourth quarter this season, second in the NFL behind Andrew Luck (80.5).

Curry leads the NBA with a fourth-quarter PER of 45.8.

While doing a news segment on the Alaska Cannabis Club, a medical marijuana organization in Alaska, reporter Charlo Greene made a grand exit from her position at CBS affiliate KTVA in Alaska (caution: the video is NSFW).

Greene revealed that she actually owns the marijuana club she was reporting on, and then quit her TV gig with some choice words live on air.

""Now everything you've heard is why I, the owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy toward fighting for freedom and fairness, which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska,"" Greene said on air. ""And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit.""

Related: Why it's risky to invest in pot stocks

The fact that Greene was so closely tied to an issue she was reporting on is a conflict of interest that would have forced her to step down, even if she hadn't made a vulgar statement.

The ex-reporter told the Alaska Dispatch News that her dramatic exit was her attempt to bring attention to the issue of marijuana legalization, and apologized for offending anyone.

Not long after the on-air incident, Greene created an Indiegogo campaign to raise funding ahead of the state's November 4 vote on legalizing recreational marijuana.

""As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand,"" she wrote in a statement on the funding site.

Greene also posted a YouTube video explaining her position.

Meanwhile, after Charlo's on-air outburst, KTVA apologized profusely, on air and off.

""We sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter during her live presentation on the air tonight,"" KTVA-11's news director Bert Rudman wrote on the station's Facebook page. ""The employee has been terminated.""

Which is exactly what happened. http://t.co/Cp5oA3zF7t,http://onforb.es/1Ah74wx,True,'Madden NFL 15' Predicts Super Bowl XLIX Winner [Update],"[Update 02/01: The below prediction turned out to not only be correct, but almost exactly on target---right down to the score.]

As we approach game day, plenty of people are making predictions about who the winner will be: the Seattle Seahawks or the New England Patriots.

Everyone from Sports Illustrated to psychic clams to shelter puppies are throwing their predictions into the ring.

My money's on Seattle, but that's mostly because of two factors. First off, I lived there when I was a kid. Second, for reasons I won't get into here, I just can't stomach the Patriots. So I'm biased.

EA Sports and Madden NFL 15 see things differently. Each year for over a decade now, EA has simulated the big game. This year they've updated the rosters and simulated the Seahawks/Patriots showdown on an Xbox One.

After a strong lead in the first half, the Seahawks get clobbered in the third and fourth quarters as Tom Brady leads the Patriots to a 28-24 victory. Here's the clip:

The game gives Tom Brady MVP thanks to his 335 yard, 4-touchdown performance. Sorry Russell Wilson fans. Julian Edelman snagged 8 catches for 106 yards, leading receivers, and Marshawn Lynch ran 118 yards and made two touchdowns.

It's important to note that over the past 11 years, the Madden prediction ratio has been an impressive 8-3.

But that doesn't mean all hope is lost for Seattle. After all, it looks like most experts are pinning their predictions to the Seahawks. What does a video game have on real-world experts? Other than a pretty sterling track record?

Madden NFL 15 was the second best-selling video game of 2015, and easily one of the best entries in the franchise I've played in years.

We'll see how well the game's prediction holds up this Sunday.

P.S. Super Bowl XLIX takes place in Arizona this year. That's my stomping grounds which, if I'm not mistaken, gives me a home-turf advantage. I'm going to use this advantage to counteract any predictive voodoo Madden NFL 15 may be working in favor of the Patriots.",2015

""We're not seeing a lot of courage here, are we? Not lots of courage. These Republicans, they're supposed to be brave!"" Trump told Fox's Megyn Kelly in December 2012.

Back then it was Trump who was set to moderate the debate, for NewsMax and Ion Television, and almost everyone in the GOP field — Mitt Romney, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry and Michele Bachman — who declining to participate.

""Mr. Trump's participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere,"" Ron Paul said in a statement at the time. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum agreed to attend.

""I was disappointed in Mitt because I really thought he would go out and had courage,"" Trump told her.

Trump has refused to participate in this week's Fox debate if Kelly — with whom he has publicly feuded this campaign cycle — is one of the moderators.

Fox released a statement addressing Trump's decision Tuesday: ""Capitulating to politicians' ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats.... We can't give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees.""

Trump shot back with a characteristically petulant response that aimed to frame his decision as strategic. ""Unlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away,"" his campaign said in statement Wednesday. ""Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn't play games.""

The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Sunday that HP (HPQ) plans to put the PC and printer operations under one roof and its business that provides software and services to corporate customers under another.

The Journal said the announcement could come as soon as Monday, and that the separation would take place next year.

HP spokeswoman Sarah Pompei declined to comment on the report.

The split follows a number of spinoffs and breakups this year. Most recently, eBay (EBAY) announced on Tuesday it would spin off the online payment platform PayPal, which it bought in 2002.

Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, took the helm in 2011 and unveiled a five-year restructuring plan. That included a major overhaul of the printer and PC business in 2012. Layoffs then and since have totaled at least 45,000, and HP projected savings of $4.5 billion per year.

Related: Big companies that are making big job cuts

Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, considered a corporate split similar to the one the Journal reported, but he left the company after only 11 months.

Whitman would have leadership roles at both companies, the Journal said. She would be CEO of the enterprise business and chairman of the hardware company.

Some investors applauded the potential move.

The split would allow HP to be more ""nimble"" and let it ""reshape"" its business, said Brendan Connaughton, chief investment officer at ClearPath Capital Partners.

In particular, Connaughton said, the move would put renewed focus on enterprise services, ""where they have incredible margins,"" sometimes upwards of 20%.

HP is among the top five performers in CNNMoney's Tech 30 index, which tracks significant tech companies. Its stock has climbed nearly 26% this year, bolstered by earnings that have climbed even as sales slumped.

Snape in Harry Potter, Hans Gruber in Die Hard, Alexander Dane in Galaxy Quest—everyone’s done an impression of at least one of his roles. “By Grabthar’s hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!” is going to be said a lot today.

While Rickman’s filmography is as varied as one can get—comedies like Dogma, romance in Sense and Sensibility, adventure in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves—his villains loom large in pop culture. 1988's Die Hard ensured that, as he set a new standard for intelligent and urbane villains that even that franchise was never able to recreate. The meeting between Gruber and Bruce Willis’ John McClane was added to the film because of Rickman’s ability to do an American accent.

For the next generation of film goers, Rickman’s mark is as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films. He was J.K. Rowling’s personal pick for the role and he was one of the select few who she talked to about the direction the books would go in. Before the fans got to read about it, Rickman was already playing Snape’s motivation.

If a character was, at least on paper, a criminal or unpleasant or mean or evil, Rickman’s performances also made them the stars. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves isn’t a good movie at all, but Rickman’s Sheriff of Nottingham is delightfully twisted.

Despite the perception that he was always a baddie, Rickman never saw it that way. On QI, John Sessions told a story of a child asking Rickman why he always played villains. To which Rickman reportedly responded, “I don’t play villains, I play very interesting people.”

The unidentified woman was seen sitting in an airport lounge, wearing a transparent blue plastic suit, on the same say a second nurse was diagnosed with the deadly disease in Dallas, Texas. The suit did not fully cover her arms, leaving her wrists exposed.

According to the Daily Caller which published the picture on Wednesday, the photographer who supplied their reporter the picture did not approach the woman to ask why she had gone to such extreme lengths.

Scroll down for video

The above woman was seen waiting for a plane at Washington Dulles Airport on Wednesday, the same day another nurse was diagnosed with the deadly virus

America's 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan flew into Texas last month from Liberia, with a layover at Dulles, but health officials say he was not showing symptoms of the virus at that point and therefore unable to spread the disease.

However, Amber Vinson, the second nurse to contract the disease after treating Duncan, flew on a commercial flight with a low-grade fever on Monday, the day before she admitted herself to the hospital with further symptoms of the virus.

The CDC confirmed today that they let her board the flight, since her temperature was below the threshold of 100.4F. But the health organization's Director Thomas Frieden initially said she should not have been on a commercial flight, after having treated Duncan in the first 'high-risk' days of his stay at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital.

Miss Vinson, 29, was flown out of Dallas on a chartered jet Wednesday evening to Atlanta, Georgia, where she is being treated at Emory University Hospital.

The parents of the teenager, named only as Lisa, reported her missing on 11 January after she failed to appear at school in the Marzahn district of the capital. She reappeared 30 hours later with injuries on her face, and told her parents she had been attacked by men of Middle Eastern or north African appearance. News of the incident spread on social media, sparking outrage among Berlin’s Russian-German community.

But when she was questioned by trained specialists three days later “she immediately admitted that the story of the rape was not true”, said the spokesman for the state prosecutor, Martin Steltner.

He said the teenager had been scared of going home after the school had contacted her parents over an incident at school.

Yet the allegations caused uproar in Berlin, particularly after reports of mass sexual assaults allegedly carried out by migrants in Cologne. A Russian-German community group staged a protest, supported by the Pegida-related Bärgida movement. The far-right National Democratic party also demonstrated in Marzahn.

The mood was exacerbated by a report on Russian state TV, in which the girl’s relatives claimed her allegations were not being investigated.

The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, also weighed in to criticise the Berlin authorities. “The news that she disappeared was kept secret for a very long time,” he told a press conference, blaming “political correctness”.

Analysis of the teenager’s mobile phone records showed she had spent the night with a friend, who is not being treated as a suspect.

Her mother told Der Spiegel magazine on Sunday that Lisa was “doing very badly” and was having treatment in a psychiatric ward.",1931

Unusual for an actor, though, was the outpouring from the racing world. Racers from all walks stepped forth on Twitter to offer their thoughts.

The Porsche Carrera GT he was a passenger in was driven by Roger Rodas, his financial advisor and a racer in his own right. Rodas was also killed in the crash. He and Walker first met at the track when Walker noticed that Rodas was driving a Porsche 911 GT3 he had once owned himself. For his part, Rodas was already quite successful at racing, as noted by Autoweek:

Rodas, though, moved up through the ranks from Porsche-only series like the Pirelli Driver's Cup, where he won twice in 2012, into the Pirelli World Challenge, leading a two-car Ford Mustang Boss 302S team, sponsored by Always Evolving and charities that he and Walker supported. Rodas raced car number 52; his co-driver, in car 75, was Erik Davis, owner of Autotopia, a massive, near-legendary car collection in Los Angeles that supplies cars for movie and TV productions. Both rookies in the series, Rodas finished 13 in GTS points, Davis 16th, despite missing the races in St. Petersburg and Lime Rock. Has Rodas competed in those races, he almost certainly would have been the series rookie of the year. Rodas' highest finish was fifth at Toronto, impressive since the GTS class has such veteran drivers as season champ Lawson Ashenbach, Jack Baldwin and Peter Cunningham.

Part of the reason Walker's death means so much to us here at Jalopnik is that he wasn't just some actor who had appeared in a few of the most important car movies of this generation, but he was a genuine enthusiast and racer himself.

That's also evidenced by the shocked outcry and and sadness from the motoring world:

A woman in Tampa, Florida recently underwent surgery to give herself a third breast. Of course Florida. Of course.

Going by the name of Jasmine Tridevil (Tri—get it?), she went under the knife to give herself a center breast in order in the hopes of obtaining reality star fame. Tridevil is trying to pitch her story to MTV with the plan to secure a reality show and, according to her Facebook page, is currently filming ""her daily life in Tampa to show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.""

Didn't she learn from other people who have tried to find fame via outrageous surgeries? And did she even give any thought to how expensive customizing all her bras is going to be?

Tridevil noted that the surgery cost $20,000 and included a “nipple” implant. She had to ask over 50 doctors to do the procedure, and when she finally found one, she was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement so he couldn't be named in public.

Aside from the public recognition, she claims she underwent the surgery because she ""wanted to make [her]self unattractive to men,"" and was uninterested in dating.

We doubt she'll have to worry about that problem anymore.

UPDATE:

Jasmine Tridevil appeared on a local news broadcast last night, and showed off her surgical enhancement. She briefly lifted up her shirt, to which the Tampa-based reporter creepily asked her to repeat and hold up longer. Tridevil said she'd rather not, and said, ""I don't feel comfortable doing that because that's also going to be on my show.""

While people have definitely been known to get outrageous surgical procedures to modify their bodies, Tridevil definitely took it to another level, and various Internet detectives are saying that this could be an elaborate bid for reality fame that is ultimately just another hoax.

640182854928961536,unverified,Plastic bag use in Wales has dropped by 71 per cent since the 5p charge was introduced  http://t.co/WM8LyhZNCO http://t.co/zuWV2ZvCdq,http://ind.pn/1UtzGNr,True,Plastic bag use down 71 per cent in Wales after 5p charge,"The number of single-use plastic carrier bags has dropped by 71 per cent in Wales since a 5p charge was introduced, according to a report.

The drastic fall in the number of carrier bags given out by Welsh shops comes just before a similar scheme is introduced in England next month.

The report, commissioned by the Labour-led Welsh government, said that 74 per cent of shoppers backed the charge and found the use of “bags for life” and other re-usable bags had resulted in a 57 per cent reduction in all bags.

The report also estimates that up to £22 million raised by the charge, introduced in 2011, has been donated to “good causes”.

As a result of these donations social benefits of up to £35 million are estimated to have been accrued through environmental, health and employment benefits.

Natural Resources Minster Carl Sargeant said that the levy, which charges a minimum of 5p for every plastic bag used, had produced a significant shift in consumer behaviour and important benefits for the environment.

Sargeant said: “I am pleased that almost four years on from the introduction of the charge in Wales’ consumer habits appear to be changing which is having a positive knock on effect on the environment as well as raising a significant amount of money for good causes.”

Wales was the first nation in the UK to introduce the Single Use Carrier Bag Charge, followed by Northern Ireland in April 2013 and Scotland in October 2014.

Carrier bag charges for large retailers are due to begin in England in October, however rules surrounding the charge have been could prove confusing for both shoppers and cashiers as it is up to till operators to decide whether the charge must be paid.

A bag must also “qualify” as plastic bag before the change can be added.

Government guidelines define a plastic carrier bag as: made of plastic, unused, including handles and 70 microns thick or less.",1916

Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a U.S.-led air strike last week.

The man, dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by the British media, was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of Islamic State leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday, Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.

The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also said to have been wounded in the attack, the paper added.

""We are aware of reports,"" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. ""We cannot confirm these reports.""

A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in U.S. air strikes.

U.S. officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq.

According to the Mail on Sunday, which said its source was an unnamed nurse, ""Jihadi John"", Baghdadi and other wounded Islamic State figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa.

The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were.

In videos released by Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons.

407267881131732992,true,Watch: Paul Walker's last trailer for the film Hours. The movie is set to release in two weeks. http://t.co/2oaPl6ySzL,http://usm.ag/IDaOA8,True,Paul Walker Dead at 40: Actor’s Trailer For New Film Hours: Video,"Fast and Furious 7 wasn't the only film Paul Walker had in the works before his death. The 40-year-old actor, who died in a tragic car wreck on Saturday, Nov. 30, gave one of his last film performances in the movie Hours. The thriller is now in post-production, and set to be released in theaters on Dec. 13.

PHOTOS: Paul's life in photos

In the Eric Heisserer-directed film, Walker played the role of Nolan, a father trying to keep his infant daughter alive in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The film also stars Genesis Rodriguez, as his wife Abigail.

The film's backdrop isn't a stretch from what the Hollywood hunk has witnessed in real life. In 2010, Walker created the non-profit organization, Reach Out Worldwide, after experiencing firsthand another natural disaster — the Haiti earthquake in January 2010.

PHOTOS: Stars we've lost in 2013

""Actor/Producer Paul Walker saw a gap between the availability of skilled resources and the requirement for such personnel in post-disaster situations,"" reads a statement on his ROWW website. ""Following the trip [to Haiti] he contacted a group of his friends to assist him in forming ROWW with the purpose of filling this unmet need.""

PHOTOS: Stars gone too soon

Indeed, Walker — in between red carpets and promoting his own projects — always found time to give back to others. Some of his other relief efforts over the years have included helping victims from the 2010 Chile earthquake and the Oklahoma City tornado in June. On the day he died, Walker was attending a toy drive in Santa Clarita, Calif., to raise money for those who recently suffered from the Philippines Typhoon.

692113799546048513,non-rumor,Hey. Can we take a minute (or all the minutes) to talk about @NiallOfficial + his glasses? https://t.co/EaGAVUW8eV https://t.co/GFzi45Liq1,http://on.mtv.com/1KCrQHO,True,Why Did Niall Horan Suddenly Start Wearing Glasses?,"Getty Images

ICYMI, Niall Horan recently started wearing glasses. Within mere hours of their debut, he was sure to clarify that they weren't necessary for, y'know, seeing purposes, but rather, looking good. Fashion, baby.

The glasses made their debut on ""Good Morning America,"" but they've popped up a number of times since, with good reason—they look a-m-a-z-i-n-g.

Getty Images

On the red carpet, they add a dash of sophistication to Niall's uncharacteristically formal outfit. Doesn't this look like someone who would read Ulysses while sitting by a fire? Yes. Yes, it does.

Getty Images

On stage, combined with his patterned shirt, they transform him into a someone you'd expect to see at a Black Keys concert. So, yes, they definitely add a new, mature element to his look. While we've seen faux glasses come and go many times over, and as much as I love the pair Niall's been wearing, I was curious to find out why now, in the year 2015, he decided to start wearing 'em.

Getty Images

It seems as though the answer is twofold—the fashion industry has begun featuring glasses more prominently and—?—they're cheaper than ever. At Fall 2015 shows, brands like Burberry and Gucci (above) sent models down the runway wearing glasses, an accessory that is typically—and deliberately—left off of runways. Their growing popularity is also great news for people who actually need glasses to see and can't deal with contacts—fans of Kylie Jenner-esque nails, rejoice.

While designer frames may cost upwards of $200, brands like Topshop, as The Telegraph reports, are selling pairs for $30. IDK about you, but it's not often that I come across a $30 necklace that also makes me look like an intellectual—I totally get what Niall found appealing.

Plus, LBR, if Harry compliments your glasses, the desire to keep wearing them only grows, I imagine. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some shopping to do.",1903

The #ToyLikeMe group had suggested the company was ""pandering to disability stereotypes"" because its only character to use a wheelchair was an elderly man.

The new character is one of many being introduced.

Other major toy manufacturers are now being urged to follow in the footsteps of the Danish firm.

The #ToyLikeMe campaign was launched to create more toys to represent the 770,000 disabled children in the UK.

We're all conga-ing up and down the street chucking coloured bricks like confetti Rebecca Atkinson #ToyLikeMe campaign co-founder

The group's petition received more than 20,000 signatures urging Lego to create toys that show disabilities amongst children.

""We want disabilities taken out of the hospital and into a more fun setting,"" says Rebecca Atkinson, who started the campaign.

The mother of two is partially deaf and has tunnel vision.

Toys with disabilities

The new character is a young beanie-hat wearing wheelchair user.

He even has his own assistance dog.

It was first spotted at the Nuremberg toy fair.

The disabled character is part of the toy company's City range, which will go on sale in June.

""We are beyond happy right now,"" says Rebecca.

""Lego have just rocked our brick-built world and made 150 million disabled kids, their mums, dads, pet dogs and hamsters very very happy.

""We're all conga-ing up and down the street chucking coloured bricks like confetti.

""But on a serious note, this move by Lego is massive in terms of ending cultural marginalisation, it will speak volumes to children, disabled or otherwise, the world over.""

Iraq has hanged 36 men convicted over the massacre of hundreds of soldiers near the city of Tikrit in June 2014.

Most of the victims are believed to have been young Shia recruits who were based at Camp Speicher when Tikrit was overrun by Islamic State militants.

It is estimated that up to 1,700 people died in one of the worst atrocities committed in Iraq in recent times.

Photos and videos published by IS at the time showed soldiers being lined up and shot at various locations.

Some bodies were pushed into the River Tigris, while others were buried in mass graves that were found after government forces recaptured the city a year later.

""The executions of 36 convicted over the Speicher crime were carried out this morning in Nasiriyah prison,"" a spokesman for the governor's office in Dhiqar province told Agence France-Presse news agency.

Some 400 of the army recruits who were killed were from Dhiqar province.

With the domestic terrorism situation that’s currently under way in Oregon being almost entirely ignored by local and federal law enforcement, the people have taken to the social media airwaves to call a spade a spade.

While #OregonUnderAttack was trending for most of the day on Sunday, another tag soon followed as a way to combat the reluctance to call a bunch of white men waving around guns at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge terrorists: #YallQaeda. The tag is dumb, yes, but so are these people.

Meanwhile, the standoff, which was sparked by the arson conviction of two men over cattle grazing rights, continues. Earlier this weekend, the men were joined by the sons of noted anti-federalist and racist Cliven Bundy, and told media that they would be willing to kill or be killed if it comes to that.

The Oregonian reports that the police, however have been keeping a low profile:



During Saturday’s rally, not a police officer was visible. And so far law enforcement agencies have not approached the refuge or blocked access to the territory.

Maybe, in the year 2016, we’re all just allowed to wave rifles in the air and take over federal buildings whenever we want to!

759653274605740032,non-rumor,Poll: Five percent of Americans would vote Harambe the dead ape for President https://t.co/CddlGnQp9o https://t.co/wCGISxIB9w,http://gaw.kr/QCbkcg6,True,Poll: Five Percent of Americans Would Vote Harambe the Dead Ape for President,"Image: Cincinnati Zoo/EPA

A new national survey from Public Policy Polling has revealed some startling truths about the American public. Specifically, the fact that 5 percent of voters believe that Harambe, the dead ape widely understood to be in Ape Hell, is the best possible candidate for President of the United States.

For those who might have forgotten, Harambe was assassinated by the Cincinnati Zoo back in May after dragging around a four-year-old who had fallen into his enclosure. And now, a not-insignificant number of voters want to hand over the nuclear codes to Harambe (who is in Hell where he belongs).

Interestingly enough, when Harambe isn’t on the ticket, there’s a higher percentage of undecided voters than when he is.

While things are looking up for Harambe, the poll doesn’t have lot of good news for Putin pal Donald Trump. Potential voters, by a margin of nearly 50 percent, said that they’re less likely to vote for a candidate if they believe Russia wants them to win.



Trump’s got problems at home, too. Sixty-two percent of voters think that Trump “should release his tax returns.” (Good luck with that.) And a whopping 51 percent do not believe that Donald Trump can be trusted with any sort of classified information on national security.

Of course, Hillary’s got her own problems to deal with.

While 18 percent of voters that think Hillary Clinton definitely has ties to Lucifer, 36 percent of total voters and 74 percent of Trump voters believe that she should be put in prison. Still, and for reasons I can’t entirely articulate, none of that is quite as troubling as the 21 percent of voters who are still unsure whether or not Hillary is directly connected to Satan, Prince of Darkness.

You can see PPP’s poll in full below. And to Harambe—best of luck this November. Otherwise, we’ll see you in hell.",1847

The 41-year-old mom of six, who did not attend college, will share her knowledge in lectures, workshops and research focused on women, peace and security — subjects that are close to her heart.

“It is vital that we broaden the discussion on how to advance women's rights and end impunity for crimes that disproportionately affect women, such as sexual violence in conflict,"" Jolie said in a May statement, announcing her U.K. gig. ""I am looking forward to teaching and learning from the students, as well as to sharing my own experiences of working alongside governments and the United Nations.""

509466295344304129,true,Microsoft is reportedly buying 'Minecraft' developer Mojang for $2 billion http://t.co/k2MHjG6pcM,http://engt.co/1wcNy1q,True,Microsoft is reportedly buying 'Minecraft' developer Mojang for $2 billion,"Well, this is rather surprising: Microsoft is in talks to buy Minecraft's developer, Mojang, according to a few different sources. The Wall Street Journal says that the ever loose-lipped ""person familiar with the matter"" has noted the deal is valued at over $2 billion, while reps for both Redmond and the Swedish developer remain mum on the subject. We've reached out to Microsoft and, as expected, were told by a company spokesperson that the outfit doesn't comment on rumors or speculation, as well. If true, this doesn't come too far after outspoken Minecraft mastermind Markus ""Notch"" Persson recently changing his stance on the Facebook/Oculus VR purchase. Maybe he's come around to the idea of no-longer being one of the world's largest indie developers? Hopefully we'll know rather soon. Until then, you'll find us playing with Steve on Xbox One.

Update: A few new developments have surfaced, including details on the deal and when it should be completed. The New York Times reports that Microsoft approached Mojang as early as three months ago and the purchase should be finished by the end of this month. Perhaps most interesting though is that should the deal go through, Notch might not stay past six months after the ink has dried. Why? He likely wants to make sure his employees are being well taken care of. According to Bloomberg's sources, Notch (not Microsoft) actually made the approach to Redmond given the positive experience Mojang had bringing Minecraft to the Xbox One. Bloomberg also reports that Notch will help with the transition into ownership, but doesn't plan on staying long beyond that -- this isn't Microsoft forcing him out, it could be him looking to try his hand at something else.

Update 2: Reuters hears that Microsoft could unveil the deal (reportedly up to $2.5 billion) on September 15th.",1832

When asked about her new addition, she told ""The News Junkie"" that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Many people believe that Tridevil's claim is a hoax, since she has not provided any real proof. Skeptics say the pics of her with the third breast are Photoshopped.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" she told 10 News in Tampa.

However, when the TV station asked for some verification, she gave the camera just ""a quick flash,"" according to the report.

She wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show,"" she told the station.

Her parents, though, apparently took her seriously.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

Ecologist Dr Derek Lee, founder of the Wild Nature Institute (WNI) , which conducts scientific research on at-risk wildlife species, took the amazing photographs in Tarangire National Park.

“Omo is leucistic, meaning many of the skin cells are incapable of making a pigment. Some are, so she is pale but not pure white, with red or blue eyes, as a true albino would be,” he explained.

“Omo is the only pale giraffe we are currently aware of, but we have also observed leucistic waterbuck, Cape buffalo and ostrich in Tarangire.

“Omo appears to get along with the other giraffes, she has always been seen with a large group of normally coloured giraffe, they don't seem to mind her different colouring.”

Photo: DEREK LEE/ CATERS NEWS

However he warned that her unique colour could make her a target for poachers in the African park.

He added: “Omo is now 15 months old. She survived her first year as a small calf, which is the most dangerous time for a young giraffe due to lion, leopard and hyena preying on them.

“Her chances of surviving to adulthood are good but adult giraffes are regularly poached for bush meat, and her colouration might make her a target.

“We and our partners are working on giraffe conservation and anti-poaching to help give Omo and her relatives a better chance of survival.

“We hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own.”

The WNI blog adds: “We were lucky enough to see her again this January, almost exactly one year [after the first sighting].

“We are thrilled that she is still alive and well. A local lodge guide christened her Omo, after a popular brand of detergent here.”",1827

It was first posted on Reddit by user fryd_ first and informed parents the ""urge to create is equally strong in all children: Boys and girls"".

Speaking to i100.co.uk, Emma Owen of Lego UK and Ireland said the letter was part of a pamphlet showing a variety of Lego doll house products targeted at girls aged four and up from the 1970s.

Commenting on the message, fryd_ first said ""it seems like we've taken a step backwards"" in forty years but Lego disagree.

The text remains relevant to this day – our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world, based on the Lego brick and the Lego system – ultimately enabling children to build and create whatever they can imagine.

The letter from 1974 in full:

To Parents The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls. It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship. A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses. The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

It's not the first time an old message from Lego has gone viral. This 1981 advert from the company was aimed at all children and shared widely online in January 2014.

At the time, several commentators contrasted the image with the more feminised marketing for Lego Friends, which is aimed specifically at girls.

The beloved series that ran on The WB and CW from 2000 to 2007 is being brought back by Netflix, the company announced on Friday.

Rory and Lorelai are coming back, too, as Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel will be returning in original roles of mother and daughter Gilmore.

Graham tweeted the news Friday evening with a photo of her smiling while holding a jacket that Graham ""stole"" from the show's costume department.

""It's time for me, and this jacket I stole in 2007, to return to work,"" Graham tweeted.

Netflix also confirmed that other cast members Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn, Kelly Bishop, and Keiko Agena will all be returning. However, the streaming company did not say when the show would be premiering or what its title would be.

The series will be produced in association with Warner Bros. Television, which is owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX).

This is not the first time Netflix has revived a popular television series for a nostalgic fanbase.

Netflix ordered a continuation of the 1990s ABC series ""Full House"" with a new title, ""Fuller House"" in April.

Remakes and reboots have been hot commodities with TV networks as of late with ""The Muppets"" and ""The X-Files"" all returning to the airwaves.

From the company Packing Sorted comes these rather clever Trolley Bags!

As you can see they fit perfectly in your trolley, meaning no wasted space and just four bags to lift out into your car. What’s more, they are all velcroed to each other at the top to stop them sliding apart until you need to remove them , but they also all roll up together for easy storage in your car boot between shopping trips.

They are easy to carry into the supermarket as demonstrated by my 4yr old son on the left who loves to help out!

Then you simply hang them on the hook at the end of your trolley as above whilst you shop. If you are scanning your own shopping you can of course put the items straight into the bags otherwise keep them rolled up until you go through the till.

The beauty of these bags are that there’s no messing around trying to open fiddly carrier bags, you simply place the bags at the end of the trolley and open them out to the end. They have velcro at the top to keep them together, which you then simply undo to lift them into the car.

These really do make shopping so simple and are the perfect solution to avoid the carrier bag charge. These are built to last, fill the whole trolley and can be used time and time again. As you can see the ones above are designed for a shallow trolley but they do also make a set for a large trolley which you can see here.

For one of my readers, I am giving away a set of Trolley Bags. All you have to do is fill out the Gleam form below.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Doctors at Bali International Medical Centre initially thought he had just been bitten by a small insect and gave him an antihistamine. When it started to blister the next day, he knew some was wrong

So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later.

Mr Thomas, who recently returned to his Bunbury home in Western Australia, was initially given an antihistamine cream to treat the mark.

But the next morning when he found it had started to blister, Mr Thomas went to see a dermatologist.

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed

The 21-year-old has since returned to his Bunbury home in WA but is yet to find out what kind of spider it was

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed.

'It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,' Mr Thomas told the newspaper.

'It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.'",1767

His statement put to rest any scary thoughts you might have had about the star.

""People create perceptions of actors based on the parts they played so it might surprise some people to learn that contrary to some of the sterner (or downright scary) characters he played, Alan was extremely kind, generous, self-deprecating and funny,"" the statement continued. ""And certain things obviously became even funnier when delivered in his unmistakable double-bass.

""As an actor he was one of the first of the adults on Potter to treat me like a peer rather than a child,"" he continued. ""Working with him at such a formative age was incredibly important and I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career. Film sets and theatre stages are all far poorer for the loss of this great actor and man.""

Author J.K. Rowling also paid tribute to the Die Hard star by tweeting, ""There are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman's death. He was a magnificent actor & a wonderful man. My thoughts are with Rima and the rest of Alan's family. We have all lost a great talent. They have lost part of their hearts.

Emma Watson AKA Hermione Granger also shared kind words on her Facebook page. ""I'm very sad to hear about Alan today. I feel so lucky to have worked and spent time with such a special man and actor,"" she wrote. ""I'll really miss our conversations. RIP Alan. We love you.""

The article and accompanying video were published on the website of journalist Carmen Aristegui, whose investigative team revealed in 2014 that Pena Nieto’s wife was in the process of acquiring a luxury home from a government contractor.

The Casa Blanca scandal, as it came to be known, dealt a major blow to the reputation of Pena Nieto, whose poll numbers have recently hit all-time lows over perceptions he and his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) have failed to stamp out rampant crime and corruption.

In a statement, government spokesman Eduardo Sanchez sought to play down the accusation of plagiarism, instead calling the omissions “style errors.” He added that Pena Nieto met all the requirements needed to graduate as a lawyer from Panamerican University.

In 2015, Aristegui was dismissed by her employer, MVS Radio, after it accused her and her team of offering, without prior authorization, the broadcaster’s name and funding for a new platform for investigative journalism called Mexicoleaks.

Aristegui argued her dismissal was politically motivated.",1718

U.S. Central Command confirmed in a statement that U.S.-led air strikes targeted ISIS leaders near their northern Iraqi hub of Mosul late Friday, without confirming whether Baghdadi was killed, AFP reported.

“This strike demonstrates the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL [ISIS] terrorist network and the group's increasingly limited freedom to maneuver, communicate and command,"" U.S. Central Command said.

Anbar province MP Mohammad al-Karbuli told Al Arabiya News Channel that coalition aircraft had targeted a gathering of ISIS leaders in al-Qaim that led to the killing of tens of people and wounded many more.

Karbuli said chaos ensued the air raid with ISIS members scrambling to transport their wounded to al-Qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the number of patients.

Reuters news agency quoted two witnesses as saying an air strike targeted a house where senior ISIS officers were meeting, near al-Qaim.

The witnesses said ISIS fighters had cleared a hospital so that their wounded could be treated. ISIS fighters used loudspeakers to urge residents to donate blood, the witnesses said.

The agency also quoted residents as saying there were unconfirmed reports that ISIS’ local leader in the western Iraqi province of Anbar and his deputy were killed.

563117355254161408,true,".@EAMaddenNFL successfully predicted the final score of #SB49.

YES, it's true: http://t.co/b6k91YNApN http://t.co/ORQXCB0jsI",http://at.nfl.com/4PTsAf3,True,'Madden NFL' successfully predicts Super Bowl score,"EA Sports

By my unofficial count, more than 1,592 hours of Network programming broke down Super Bowl XLIX last week. Turns out, all we needed to do was to run the Madden simulator to figure out who was going to win the game. Seriously.

You don't believe me? Watch this video right here. ""Madden NFL 15"" Super Bowl simulation accurately predicted the following:

» The Seahawks were going to own the third quarter and lead the Patriots 24-14.

» The Patriots would win the game 28-24. (Spoiler alert if you have the game on the DVR, but the Patriots would win that game by that exact score.EXACT!)

» Tom Brady would be the Super Bowl MVP. What might be more impressive is Madden had him finishing with 335 yards and four touchdowns. He actually finished with 328 passing yards and four touchdowns. Just seven yards off. SEVEN! More impressive than the score.

» Julian Edelman would catch the winning touchdown pass. And not only that, but the exact (EXACT) pass play to make it happen. Edelman had eight receptions for 106 yards. He finished with nine catches for 109 yards. (Mind officially blown.)

» Pete Carroll would call an ill-advised pass play after getting the ball down to the 1-yard line with under a minute left to go in the game.

All right, that last one might not have actually occurred. But would it have surprised you at this point? This was a pretty amazing run. And to think we've been so concerned about Skynet all of these years when we really should have been on the lookout for Madden, who is now 9-3 in Super Bowl simulations. Now if we could just get Madden to pick my fantasy team, too, I think we'd be all set.

ABC reportedly paid #DarrenWilson a 'mid to high' six figure fee for his interview: http://t.co/323suqFAs1 ht @senorchompers #Ferguson,http://www.alternet.org/abc-reportedly-paid-darren-wilson-six-figure-fee-interview,True,ABC Reportedly Paid Darren Wilson Six-Figure Fee for Interview,"ABC Reportedly Paid Darren Wilson Six-Figure Fee for Interview

ABC offered Darren Wilson a “mid-to-high” six-figure payment to give his first and only public interview on the network, according to the website Got News. An unnamed source from NBC reportedly told the website that both networks engaged in a bidding war to score the first interview with Wilson but NBC backed out after its rival “upped the ante.”

The interview was taped in an undisclosed location and broadcast Tuesday, the day after a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson for the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The grand jury’s decision set off protests and riots in Ferguson and many other U.S. cities. Demonstrators called for justice in the killing of Brown and criticized the police and prosecutors for how they investigated and tried the case.

During the interview, which was conducted by ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Wilson gave his account of the events that took place before he killed Brown. Most of what Wilson told ABC was already covered in his testimony before the grand jury. When asked by Stephanopoulos if there was anything he could have done differently, Wilson said “No.”

ABC and Stephanopoulos have been criticized for not challenging Wilson’s account of the incident. People took to Twitter to express their dislike of the interview.

Ibtihaj Muhammad won her first Olympic medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Saturday, August 13 — but that wasn’t her only first!

The 30-year-old athlete became the first U.S. athlete to compete at the Olympic Games wearing a hijab, a veil commonly worn by Muslim women.

Muhammad took home the bronze medal with Team USA during the women’s team saber fencing event on Saturday. She competed with fellow fencers Dagmara Wozniak, Mariel Zagunis and Monica Aksamit to defeat the Italian team 45–30. (The last time the U.S. women’s fencing team won a medal was at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.)

Prior to joining the national fencing team in 2010, Muhammad was a three-time All-American and 2005 Junior Olympic Champion at Duke University. She graduated from the school in 2007 with a double major in international relations and African American studies.

Earlier this week, the New Jersey native spoke to USA Today about becoming the first American to compete at the Olympics in a hijab.

“A lot of people don’t believe that Muslim women have voices or that we participate in sport,” she said on Monday, August 8. “And it’s not just to challenge misconceptions outside the Muslim community, but within the Muslim community. I want to break cultural norms.”

Muhammad added, “It’s a blessing to represent so many people who don’t have voices, who don’t speak up, and it’s been a really remarkable experience for me.”

554597409351671808,false,Police chief investigating #CharlieHebdo reportedly killed himself while preparing report on terror attack... Hmm... http://t.co/VpdQjqHPRr,http://bit.ly/1ANZNUZ,True,Police Chief Investigating Charlie Hebdo Attack Reportedly Commits Suicide,"A police commissioner investigating the Charlie Hebdo attack reportedly committed suicide, fueling suspicion that some form of a cover-up is underway.

Helric Fredou, 45, was found dead in his office Thursday after allegedly killing himself with his service weapon while writing a report on the terror attack, and his death was largely ignored by the mainstream media.

“According to the police union, [the] commissioner was depressed and experiencing burnout,” India’s Medhaj News reported, and a separate French report said a coroner ruled it a suicide the very next day.

But was it a suicide, or did he know too much? And what was in his report?

The Charlie Hedbo attack has already raised questions about the government’s involvement, especially after it was revealed the suspects were linked to a FBI asset, Anwar al-Awlaki, who was a key player in nearly every terror plot targeting the West, including 9/11, and had even dined at the Pentagon afterwards.

“I was sent, me, Cherif Kouachi, by al-Qaeda of Yemen. I went over there and it was Anwar al-Awlaki who financed me,” one of the suspects told a television station prior to his death, and the other suspect also met al-Awlaki in Yemen back in 2011, according to Yemini intelligence.

Al-Awlaki had also met the Ft. Hood shooter, the underwear bomber and the alleged 9/11 hijackers, and considering his ties to the FBI, he was likely recruiting patsies for terror attacks in the West.

“Do not expect the corporate media, however, to focus on the suspicious relationships of the Kouachi brothers,” Kurt Nimmo wrote, and the media won’t focus on the police commissioner’s death either.

But according to a new study, a sizeable number of vegetarians commit the ultimate dietary sin when they get drunk: they eat meat.

U.K.-based discount code website VoucherCodesPro conducted a poll with 1,789 Brits who claim to be vegetarians and found that 37 percent of all respondents admitted to eating meat after they’ve had too much to drink.

The majority of respondents (63 percent) said they stood by their personal dietary codes no matter how much they drink. But the majority of those polled who admit they've fallen of the vegetarian wagon while imbibing say it happens a lot.

When asked how often they eat meat:

--34% said every time they get drunk on a night out

--26% replied fairly often

--22% said “Rarely”

--18% said “Occasionally”

The most popular meat consumed by drunk vegetarians was kebab meat. In the U.K, Middle Eastern kebab shops are as ubiquitous as New York City pizza places and offer a wide variety of options from skewers to wraps and platters. Beef burgers were the second most popular drunk snack, followed by bacon, fried chicken, and pork sausages. Vegetarians reported that they spent an average of about $7.40 a sitting on their meaty midnight meals.

But when it came to disclosing their dirty dietary secret, a majority of meat eating vegetarian respondents (69 percent) said they never told others they ate meat.

Lest you think only British vegetarians are guilty of being two faced, a 2014 study conducted by the Humane Research Council found that 84 percent of American vegetarians will eventually start consuming meat again at some point in their lives.",1692

The country is a leader in the export of cut flowers, with a 52% share of the global market . And tulips are especially popular.

So, when photographer George Steinmetz was offered a ride over the country's largest fields, he didn't hesitate. ""I’ve been doing aerial photos for a long time,"" he tells TIME. ""I had a friend in Holland who saw that I was in Stuttgart, Germany, for an exhibition, and he said, ‘You should come to Amsterdam, I’m going to fly over fields of tulips, if you want a ride in a helicopter.’ It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.""

Sitting in the front seat, Steinmetz felt like an aerial paparazzo, he says: ""When you’re that low in the sky, it’s kind of like street photography. It’s kind of instinctive. If you think too much, you screw things up.""

In fact, he adds, ""it’s good not to have too many rules when you go up. You just want to look around. Generally for that subject matter it’s nice to have people to give a sense of scale and activity. Otherwise, you don’t know if you’re looking at a close up of a carpet or a sweater. You try to look for patterns. The best way to shoot this, I think, is with a telephoto lens. You go up and you respond to what you’re seeing.""

In the end, Steinmetz is the first to admit that his images are ""chroma-porn,"" he says. ""The colors are so bright, and that kind of thing works very well on Instagram.""

Wary Parisians vow to keep party going one week after attacks







Parisians braved the cold and rain on Friday to go for drinks and make sure the lights stayed on in the trendy, multicultural eastern parts of the capital that were hit by Islamist militants only a week ago.





Many of the 130 victims of last Friday's attacks were enjoying drinks after work on an unusually warm autumn night when Islamic State gunmen sprang from cars and sprayed them with bullets in France's worst violence since World War Two.





Tension was still high in Paris at the end of a week in which there were scores of false alarms, episodes of crowd panic and a seven-hour gunfight that left the suspected mastermind of the attacks dead.





Though some Parisians were still thinking twice about going out, some 200 figures from the country's cultural and media elite called on France to continue to have fun in defiance of militants who call Paris the ""capital of prostitution and vice"".





""One week on, let's turn on the lights and light up candles in our cafes, streets, squares and towns and make ourselves heard through the music that they hate,"" they wrote in a tribute published in the Huffington Post on Friday.

U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed to NBCDFW.com that Maj. Nidal Hasan’s salary cannot be suspended unless he is proven guilty in the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting in Texas, citing the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin May 30.

If Hasan, 42, had been a civilian Defense Department employee, Army officials could have suspended his pay after just seven days, NBCDFW.com reports.

A military judge refused to delay Hasan’s trial earlier this month after his attorneys sought to postpone the court-martial to Sept. 1. Hasan’s attorneys claimed military jurors may be influenced by national media coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings that compared the two Muslim suspects -- Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev – to Hasan.

Prosecutors countered that the delay was unnecessary because Hasan was mentioned only briefly in some news reports about the April 15 attacks in Boston.

Hasan faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder.

The White House and Pentagon have refused to characterize Hasan's attack as terrorism, instead terming it “workplace violence.” The victims have been denied Purple Hearts and are suing the military because they claim the ""workplace violence"" designation gives them diminished access to medical care and financial benefits normally available to those whose wounds are designated as ""combat related.""",1662

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said on Twitter that he's bailed the billionaire out twice -- and suggested the GOP presidential frontrunner might need his help a third time.

The exchange was initiated by Trump, who had retweeted a badly Photoshopped image showing the prince with Fox News host Megyn Kelly, calling him a co-owner of the network:

He also included a link to a story showing that he was part of the group that bought New York City's Plaza Hotel from Trump in 1995. As part of the deal, bin Talal paid off Trump's debt on the hotel in what the New York Times said was ""a defeat for the real estate developer.""

Trump's tweet also claimed bin Talal is ""co-owner"" of Fox News. While the prince is an investor in News Corp, his stake is worth 1 percent, according to CNN.

Trump and bin Talal also tangled on Twitter last month.

Starbucks is experimenting with a beer-flavored coffee called a dark barrel latte in a ""handful"" of stores in Ohio and Florida, a Starbucks representative confirms to Mashable. The coffee tastes like a dark, stout beer — think Guinness — and has no alcohol content.

""We regularly test new beverages, and testing is an essential part of bringing the Starbucks Experience to our customers,"" the rep says. ""We’re looking forward to learning more from the test, but do not have additional information to share on future availability of this product in our stores.""

Reddit user so_oakland posted an image last month of the product's ingredients.

The image only recently surfaced, however, most likely after customers on Twitter began mentioning trying the drink.

In the image, the drink is described as ""a blend of espresso, dark carmel and chocolaty stout flavored sauce, and freshly steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and dark caramel drizzle."" It also specifies that the stout flavor has a ""roasted malt"" taste.

I drove 4 hours to a wedding, which also involved a lot of sitting during dinner etc but also 2-3 hours of dancing. I left at 2am and went to bed, driving home 4 hours back.



So in total, the 6 Plus was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly.



As I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive (yes, sitting again ), I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones slightly distorted.

As highlighted in a few reports shared in the MacRumors forums , a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch. In one instance , a new iPhone 6 Plus was bent during a day of dancing, dining, and driving to a wedding.This potential for bending is of course not unique to the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports of bent iPhone 5 and 5s handsets surfacing in the past few years. As iPhones get thinner and larger, however, storage of the handset in a pocket becomes riskier. Unlike smaller phones that can slide out of the way, pressure points from sitting or bending now have greater potential to cause the longer iPhone to flex in a way that will damage the device.To prevent bending, iPhone 6 Plus owners may want to remove their iPhones from their pockets before sitting or bending.

I drove 4 hours to a wedding, which also involved a lot of sitting during dinner etc but also 2-3 hours of dancing. I left at 2am and went to bed, driving home 4 hours back.



So in total, the 6 Plus was about 18 hours in my pocket while sitting mostly.



As I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the drive (yes, sitting again ), I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones slightly distorted.

As highlighted in a few reports shared in the MacRumors forums , a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch. In one instance , a new iPhone 6 Plus was bent during a day of dancing, dining, and driving to a wedding.This potential for bending is of course not unique to the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports of bent iPhone 5 and 5s handsets surfacing in the past few years. As iPhones get thinner and larger, however, storage of the handset in a pocket becomes riskier. Unlike smaller phones that can slide out of the way, pressure points from sitting or bending now have greater potential to cause the longer iPhone to flex in a way that will damage the device.To prevent bending, iPhone 6 Plus owners may want to remove their iPhones from their pockets before sitting or bending. If a pocket is unavoidable, then customers may want to place their device in a roomier pocket that allows the device to slide out the way. A rigid case may also provide protection from flexing or bending, as well damage from dropping the device.",1646

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE

KABUL, Afghanistan — An Afghan mother has become a hero among some of her countrymen after allegedly fighting the Taliban militants who had just killed her policeman son.

Reza Gul, a resident of Balabolok district of western Farah province, said she rushed to the small police outpost near her home after it came under attack early on November 17.

She told NBC News she screamed in anger and grief when she saw her son Safiullah — who had been guarding the outpost along with a group of lightly armed policemen — shot dead. Then, she said, she took action.

“The Taliban attacked our village and my son’s outpost at dawn,"" explained Gul, who like many in Afghanistan does not know her exact age but who estimates she is between 50 and 60. “After seeing my young son’s body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die.”

Gul spoke to NBC News by telephone from Farah, the capital of Farah Province. NBC News could not independently confirm Gul’s account, although local police and media repeated similar versions of the incident.

“I fought them until dark along with other boys from the police, and [we] killed at least 25 of them,” she added, saying that her husband, daughter-in-law, daughter and her teenage son also joined in and supplied her with ammunition.

Gul's daughter, Fatima, told Afghan television channel Tolo News that she had prepared bullets for her father and mother to fight.

""We started a kind of family war against the Taliban,"" she said.",1638

That's according to a new Bloomberg report, which claims that Persson was attracted to the idea of a deal after striking up a close relationship with recently-promoted Xbox chief Phil Spencer.

The positive experience of working with Microsoft on the hugely successful Xbox versions of Minecraft is also said to be a factor.

But Minecraft is also now available on PlayStation 4 and PS3 and a Vita edition is also due for release. It's unclear what would happen to the ongoing development of the game on Sony's platforms in the event of a Microsoft buyout.

Both parties have so far declined to comment on the reports.

ORIGINAL STORY 9/9/14 11.55Pm: Microsoft is allegedly nearing a deal to acquire Mojang, the creator of Minecraft and Scrolls, for $2 billion.

According to the Wall Street Journal, this deal could be finalised as early as this week.

Minecraft has gone on to sell 50 million copies since its release in 2009, while Mojang made $100 million in profits last year.

This would be a surprising move, if it happens, because Mojang founder Markkus ""Notch"" Persson has always been critical of giant corporations. In fact, he cancelled the Oculus version of Minecraft once the VR company sold to Facebook.

Microsoft is continuing its long and storied tradition of not commenting on rumours or speculation, and we've reached out to Mojang and will update should the studio shed more light on the matter.",1628

A report Tuesday in Canada's The Province revealed the finalization of an NHL franchise in Las Vegas, with only the new team's ownership left to determine. The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports league's for the first time in the city's history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the city's potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry.

On Wednesday morning, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas.

Seattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015. A new team in Toronto would mean a second franchise for the city. The Maple Leafs are the NHL's highest grossing and most valuable franchise by net worth.

In a story that will haunt my dreams, entomologist Piotr Naskrecki was walking through the rainforest of Guyana at night in search of katydids, as that is what he was studying. He says that typically in his field research, he walks slowly and quietly, so as not to disturb anything. He wears a headlamp, but turns it off on occasion, which he says helps him zone in on the sounds around him. Naskrecki was listening for the distinctive sounds of katydid wings when instead he heard something moving, crushing dry leaves under its feet. In his peripheral vision, he saw what he thought was a large, hairy rodent.



It wasn't a large, hairy rodent, however. Instead, it was my very worst nightmare: the largest spider in the world. A South American goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), to be exact. This big, hairy bowl of wrong has legs up to a foot in length, with feet that have hard tips and make clicking sounds as they move along. Its huge fangs are capable of puncturing the skull of a rodent with one clutch. Its size was compared to that of a newborn pup.



Naskrecki said that not only did the spider make a hissing sound, rear its front legs and flex its monstrous fangs, but it rubbed its legs against its abdomen, producing a hairy cloud that made Piotr's eyes tear up and burn for several days afterward. (As I've written this and uploaded the images, I've stopped to take deep breaths several times and once glanced at a world map to remind myself how far that species is from me.)

The incident occurred on Sept. 20, 2009. The police served an outstanding warrant to one Henry Davis, 52, according to the Beast — but they were actually looking for a different Henry Davis who had a different middle name and Social Security number. But after the police apparently ran Davis’s license plate number and saw his name, he was pulled over and arrested, the Daily Beast reported.

Davis was then taken to the police department and placed in a holding cell, according to the Beast, citing Davis’s testimony. When he complained about being placed with another person in a one-man cell and asked for a sleeping mat, police officers allegedly slammed his head against the wall, hit him and kicking him in the head, per the Beast. Davis was eventually taken to the emergency room.

He was charged with property damage, according to the Beast, with the charging documents stating that Davis “did transfer blood to the uniform.”

The local prosecutor later dropped the property damage charges, the Beast reported, because of conflicting reports from the officers involved. Afterward, Davis sued the department over the incident, but court documents show that a federal district judge ruled in favor of the Ferguson police in the last year.

Davis appealed the district judge’s ruling to federal appeals court in March 2014. Read his original complaint below.

Nestle is announcing a voluntary recall of the products because they may include meat that was involved in the massive recall earlier this month of 8.7 million pounds of meat produced by California-based Rancho Feeding Corporation.

The following batch numbers are affected by the recall:

Hot Pockets Philly Steak and Cheese in 8x9 oz: 3021544512, 3029544512, 3197544512 and 3240544512.

Hot Pockets Philly Steak and Cheese in 4x22.5 oz: 3197544512 and 3240544512.

Hot Pockets Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese in 8x9 oz: 3211544512, 3248544512 and 3283544512.

Nestle said in the recall announcement that while it did not buy meat from Rancho directly, some meat affected by the Rancho recall was used at a facility that produces Hot Pockets in California. People who may have purchased Hot Pockets products affected by the recall can return them for a full refund, or call Nestle Consumer Services at 800-392-4057.

While there have been no illnesses linked with the Rancho recall, the United States Department of Agriculture noted that the recall was initiated because Rancho ""processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection. Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce.""",1598

The experts at Madden not only predicted the exact final score of the game but also a handful of other details that kept their days-old predictions eerily close to the actual results from Sunday night.

Who Would Have TDs

Some were not entirely surprising, like the prediction that Seattle Seahawks star Marshawn Lynch would score a touchdown (which he did).

Same for the Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski (he also who scored a touchdown).

EA SPORTS/YouTube

Halftime Score

Madden predicted that the score would be close going into halftime - 17 to 14. The game was actually tied at the half at 14.

Rare TD

They predicted that punt returner and wide receiver Julian Edelman would score one of the Patriot's critical touchdowns. Prior to this season, Edelman had only scored ten other touchdowns since he was first drafted in 2009.

EA SPORTS/YouTube

MVP Prediction

The pick that Tom Brady would earn his third MVP honor was also on target.

Yardage and TDs

Madden guessed that Brady would throw 335 yards, leading to four touchdowns; he was actually just shy of that, with 328 yards and four touchdowns.

This is the ninth time in the past 12 years that the game has accurately predicted the winner of the Super Bowl, but this is by far the most detailed read of the virtual tea leaves.",1591

Prehistoric bones believed to have belonged to a mammoth have been unearthed during construction at Oregon State's football stadium, according to a report by the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Among the bones unearthed was what is believed to be a femur from a mammoth. Oregon State University

Construction crews made the discovery Monday while excavating the site of the Valley Football Center expansion project at Reser Stadium in Corvallis.

Deputy athletic director Mark Massari told the newspaper the bones were uncovered at the site of the football team's future locker room.

At least one large bone was removed by a university archaeologist Tuesday, the Gazette-Times reported.

An OSU professor who examined the bones estimated they are at least 10,000 years old, Clark said.

The school said in a news release that Loren Davis, an associate professor of anthropology at Oregon State, was summoned to the site after the initial discovery was made.

“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures,” said the 77-year-old Pontiff, according to Italian news sources.

Pope Francis has been cast as a much more liberal figure compared with his predecessors. Since ascending to the church’s helm last year, he has attempted to engage with homosexuals and unwed couples and backed the Big Bang Theory.

Correction: The original version of this story misattributed a quotation from Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, to Pope Francis. It was Pope Paul VI who said, “One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ.” The original version of this story misinterpreted comments made by Francis who said in recent remarks, according to Vatican Radio, “The Holy Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us.” This quotation was interpreted in press accounts to mean that the Pope believes all animals go to heaven. A Vatican spokesman told Reuters on Dec. 13 that this was not the Pope’s intended message.

Following months of speculation, Netflix is officially reviving Gilmore Girls, the company and Warner Bros. Television announced on Friday, January 29.

Returning for the new batch of episodes are series stars Lauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Scott Patterson (Luke), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Sean Gunn (Kirk) and Keiko Agena (Lane). Producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino and production company Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions are all involved as well.

The show's title and episode count have not been announced. It is unlikely that Melissa McCarthy (Sookie), who has since become a major movie star, will return.

Fans were sent into a tizzy in October when news of the possible revival broke. Earlier this month, Agena teased the return by posting a photo to Instagram of herself with series producer Helen Pai.

Gilmore Girls, centering on a tight-knit mother-daughter pair interacting with their quirky small-town neighbors, bowed out in May 2007 after seven seasons. The first six ran on The WB, with The CW airing the final season.

Netflix has made a cottage industry of rebooting popular series, including its new season of Arrested Development and the February 26 launch of the updated Full House series Fuller House.

The move would separate HP's personal computer and printer business from its corporate hardware and other services, according to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. A spokesperson for HP declined to comment.

In recent years, the company has attempted to diversify its income streams as a global decline in PC sales has hit its core business. A spin-off of the PC business had last been publicly discussed in 2011, around the time that HP bought British software company Autonomy. The acquisition proved disastrous, having been worth $11 billion at the time and later resulting in a write-down of $8.8 billion due to ""accounting improprieties.""

HP is a massive hardware and software provider with a market cap of almost $66 billion. It is among the most storied U.S. tech companies, having been founded in a Palo Alto garage in 1939.

Separately, the companies will each be major players in their respective markets. The new business-focused company would have brought in at least $40 billion in 2013. The PC and printer business brought in around $55.9 billion.

Dion Weisler, an executive within HP, will become CEO of the PC and printer business, while current HP CEO Meg Whitman will be chairman. Whitman will retain the CEO title for the business-focused company. It was not immediately clear what the new enterprise business would be named.

After being on the winning side of the Broncos-Steelers matchup in the AFC Championship Game, it seems Lusk laid into his friend (a Steelers fan) a bit:

""I have a buddy who's a good Pittsburgh Steelers fan -- and we had some bets going for the Steelers game and of course the Broncos won so I rode him pretty hard for two or three days and gave him a lot of heck."" (As told to Steve Staeger of KUSA)

His friend responded as any dejected, revenge-seeking Pittsburgh fan on the losing side of a bet would -- by posting an ad in a newspaper listing his friend's home for sale in exchange for tickets, airfare and accommodations to Super Bowl 50.

“I’d like to look to Broncos Country for some ideas on how to get him back,” he said. Any ideas? Posted by 9NEWS (KUSA) on Tuesday, January 26, 2016

While Super Bowl ticket prices are quite high -- they aren't 2,100-square-feet, three-bedroom, two-bath high.

According to senior U.S. officials, the passenger plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the disputed Donetsk region of the country, where pro-Russian separatists have for months been fighting Ukrainian security forces.

Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that “it’s pretty clear” that Russia supplied the separatists in Ukraine with the weapon, laying out evidence from US intelligence and social media linking the separatists to the attack.

“We know with confidence—with confidence—that the Ukrainians did not have such a system anywhere near the vicinity at that point and time. So it obviously points a very clear finger at the separatists,” he said on CNN.

Flight 17 was almost three hours into an over 11 hour flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when the Boeing 777 came down. All 283 passengers and 15 crew are believed dead. At least one American citizen is believed to have been killed on the flight.

Pro-Russian separatists denied responsibility for the crash. But Anton Gerashenk, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, wrote on his Facebook page that the plane was downed by a Russian surface-to-air missile known as a Buk, which can strike targets far above Flight 17’s last reported altitude of 33,000 feet.

The separatist rebels have reportedly taken custody of the bodies at the crash site, according to Ukrainian officials.

Known as South American Goliath birdeater, the humongous eight-legged creepy crawly creature has a body the size of a fist and a leg span the size of a small child. Harvard entomologist Piotr Naskrecki recently encountered one while taking a nighttime stroll through a rain forest in Guyana.

""When I turned on the light, I couldn't quite understand what I was seeing,"" Naskrecki told the website Live Science.

The spider can weigh up to six ounces, according to Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, where Naskrecki is employed. Though it does not eat birds, as the name implies, it hunts worms, rats and other small animals.

Size isn’t the spider’s only chill-inducing quality. It makes loud clicking sounds with its front claws when threatened and defends itself by rubbing its back legs together to shoot clouds of microscopic barbs through the air that are highly irritating to the eyes and skin. If it chomps down on you with its 2-inch-long fangs, you probably won’t die, unless you are allergic. But its bite contains enough venom to make you sick for days.

Source: Fairewinds Energy Education

Host: Nathaniel White-Joyal

Date: Aug 27, 2013

At 11:30 in

Arnie Gundersen, Fairewinds chief engineer: The big problem is the nuclear reactors themselves have cracked floors. The buildings in those reactor buildings have cracked floors. And groundwater is getting into those buildings, and becoming contaminated, and then leaking out. So, in addition to what’s in those tanks, the physical plant itself is contaminating the groundwater as well.

So what Tepco tried to do is to build a wall along the water. They injected basically a concrete type of a compound and made the ground less porous. That’s not a good idea — it’s a poor idea — because what happened is the mountain that’s behind Fukushima continues to pour the water into the ground. Now it’s got no place to go. So now the groundwater’s rising and rising and rising and likely over-topping this wall, certainly going around it on the sides. So we’ve got radioactive water that can no longer be stopped from getting in the ocean.

It’s worse than that though. The radioactive water has made the site seismic response different. The buildings that were on dry land are now on mushy land. So that if there were to be another earthquake, the seismic response of these buildings — which was already marginal — is further compromised because the ground that they are now on is wet soggy soil, when before it had been firm.

More than 340,000 have signed a pledge to stop shopping at Target, in response to the corporation’s announcement this week that transgender employees and customers will be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.

“This means a man can simply say he ‘feels like a woman today’ and enter the women's restroom... even if young girls or women are already in there,” stated the American Family Association, which started the petition.

Target on Tuesday became the first giant retailer to weigh in on an issue at the center of a heated national debate.

The announcement came just after North Carolina passed a law requiring people to use bathrooms in public facilities that correspond with their gender at birth.

“#BoycottTarget has resonated with Americans,” wrote AFA president Tim Wildmon.

“Target’s harmful policy poses a danger to women and children. Predators and voyeurs would take advantage of the policy to prey on those who are vulnerable. It’s clear now that many customers agree.”

Scores of charred corpses and bodies with bullet wounds littered the streets from Saturday night's attack on Dalori village just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the biggest city in the northeast, according to survivors and soldiers.

The shooting and burning continued for four hours, survivor Alamin Bakura said, weeping on a telephone call to The Associated Press. He said several of his family members were killed or wounded.

The violence continued as three female suicide bombers blew up among people who managed to flee to neighboring Gamori village, killing many people, according to a soldier at the scene who insisted on anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to journalists.

It was not known how many scores of people were killed because bodies still were being collected, including from the surrounding bushes where the insurgents hunted down fleeing villagers, according to Abba Shehu, a security guard helping collect corpses.

Boko Haram has taken to attacking soft targets, increasingly with suicide bombers, since the military last year drove them out of towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria.

Gallagher also insists that there's fire behind all of the NHL-related smoke emanating out of Seattle, Wash. and reports that Vancouver-born billionaire Victor Coleman would be among the bidders interested in bringing a second NHL club to the Pacific Northwest.

While rumors about Las Vegas expansion continue to swirl, to the consternation of players like Chicago Blackhawks nofunnick Jonathan Toews, NHL brass has been steadfast in their insistence that nothing is imminent for the league on the expansion front.

""We're not ready to expand,"" Bettman said in early May, addressing rumors of potential NHL expansion in Las Vegas. ""We, as I repeatedly have said, have received expressions of interest from people who might want to own a franchise in Las Vegas - as we have from a number of other cities - but we're not involved in any expansion process.""

There are no rallies or news cameras there, no signs or ribbons to mark the spot where, the police say, Deandre Joshua, 20, was shot once in the head and then set on fire inside his car. He was the only person killed during the fires, looting and riots that shook the city after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in Mr. Brown’s killing. But in the days since, Mr. Joshua’s death has largely become a footnote to Ferguson’s story — an open homicide case and a bitter mystery for his family.

“The unknown is what scares me,” his mother, Maria, 39, said in an interview at her home in nearby University City, where her son and his identical twin brother, Dont’A (Don-TAY), shared the basement. “I don’t know what happened to him.”

The police have offered few details about the killing. Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police suggested last week that there could be “a nexus” between the broader unrest and Mr. Joshua’s death, but a police spokesman said it remained unclear whether there was any direct link. The police have not named any suspects, and have said it was unclear precisely when Mr. Joshua was killed or why his body was burned.",1467

Eric Lawson, who portrayed the rugged Marlboro man in cigarette ads during the late 1970s, has died. He was 72.

Lawson died on 10 January at his home in San Luis Obispo of respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, his wife, Susan Lawson, said on Sunday.

Lawson was an actor with bit parts on such TV shows as Baretta and The Streets of San Francisco when he was hired to appear in print Marlboro ads from 1978 to 1981. His other credits include Charlie's Angels, Dynasty and Baywatch. His wife said injuries sustained on the set of a western film ended his career in 1997.

A smoker since age 14, Lawson later appeared in an anti-smoking commercial that parodied the Marlboro man and an Entertainment Tonight segment to discuss the negative effects of smoking. Ms Lawson said her husband was proud of the interview, even though he was smoking at the time and continued the habit until he was diagnosed with COPD.

""He knew the cigarettes had a hold on him,"" she said. ""He knew, yet he still couldn't stop.""

A few actors and models who appeared in adverts for Marlboro cigarettes have died of smoking-related diseases. They include David Millar, who died of emphysema in 1987, and David McLean, who died of lung cancer in 1995.

Lawson is also survived by six children, 18 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.",1459

Kendall Jenner is “full-on dating” rapper A$AP Rocky, a source confirms to Us Weekly. “It’s the real deal,” says the insider of the pair, who first sparked rumors of a hookup when he attended her PacSun launch in NYC February 8.

Unlike with her on-off flings with L.A. Lakers guard Jordan Clarkson and former One Direction singer Harry Styles, the source adds, the supermodel, 20, is going the extra mile to see Rocky, who has been previously linked to fellow top model Chanel Iman and Iggy Azalea.

On July 24, she was spotted cheering on the “L$D” MC (born Rakim -Mayers) during his set at NYC’s Panorama Festival and met up with the music producer for a late night dinner date at Blue Ribbon Brasserie in Soho.

Just one week later, she brought him to her sister Kylie’s 19th birthday party at the Nice Guy in West Hollywood, where they acted affectionate and snuck out the back door together.

A pal of the Estée Lauder spokeswoman says she loves that she and Rocky have the fashion world in common. “They’re both major players,” says the friend, noting the 27-year-old face of Dior Homme has collaborated with high-end designers like J.W.

Yes, seriously.

The dastardly concoction was spotted by a Reddit user called, perfectly, joes_nipples, at Kent State University. Better yet, said concoction is apparently being called Dewitos. Just look at this monstrosity:

Nipples reported that the Doritos-flavored Mountain Dew was served at ""room temperature,"" and tasted ""like a weird mix of Mountain Dew flavor and Doritos. Like if you shoved a handful of Doritos in your mouth and chugged some Dew at the same time.""

But Nipples added, ""It honestly wasn't that disgusting. It tasted like orange with a Doritos after taste. It tasted like straight Doritos afterwards though. Weirdest thing I've ever drunken.""

Before you call shenanigans, read the following statement that PepsiCo sent to Quartz; it would appear this is not a hoax.

We are always testing out new flavors of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us. We opened up the DEW flavor vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities.

Worrying reports have surfaced of a bug that wipes documents from Apple's cloud storage service iCloud Drive.

Users have reported that an iOS 8 bug is deleting documents stored in iCloud Drive without permission.

Exit Theatre Mode

Multiple MacRumors users report that the bug is triggered by the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8. Though the option explicitly states that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" many users have lost documents in iCloud Drive following their attempt to reset their settings.

User comments suggest that the bug seems to be specific to documents from iWork apps, such as Keynote, Pages, and Numbers.

iCloud Drive allows users to store and access documents such as spreadsheets, PDFs, and images across all of their Apple devices. If you've got iCloud Drive enabled, you'll want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on your devices until Apple has addressed the issue.

It's not the first problem to arise since iOS 8's launch, with iOS update 8.0.1 being pulled after reports of unresponsive Touch ID and broken cellular reception. Apple has since released update 8.0.2 to address the issues.

The officer is expected to recover.

Columbus police are still investigating the incident, and as of press time, neither the name of the officer nor the name of the restaurant has been released. The department tweeted that at “this point in the investigation” they do not believe the incident was “intentional.”

And if the trend continues, it may soon be the norm for kids to spend a year learning a specialized skill, such as getting really good at riding their bike with no hands or seeing how many Twizzlers they can fit in their mouth, rather than reflexively moving up to the next grade.” The report also noted that for many students, the decision was primarily driven by money, as 12 extra months of allowance would provide financial breathing room once they started junior high.",1432

Although the last reported sighting of the Kashmir musk deer was around 60 years ago, a Wildlife Conservation Society study confirms that these fanged beasts are still alive and kicking.

Musk deer like the Kashmir (there are seven similar species that live around Asia, like the Siberian one shown above) use their fangs during mating season to fight other males and impress females -- not to suck blood.

DAMMARTIN-EN-GOELE, France — An intense manhunt for the gunmen who killed 12 people at the offices of a French satirical magazine came to a bloody and dramatic end Friday, when the al Qaeda-linked brothers suspected in the terror attack were killed in a gun battle with police at a printing factory outside of Paris.

In Paris, a second siege played out at a market where a third suspect shot and killed four people before police stormed in and killed him.

In all, 17 people were killed in the terror attacks that began on Wednesday with the massacre at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, sparking the intense manhunt that paralyzed France and put the West on edge.

French authorities are still searching for a fourth suspect, believed to have aided the supermarket gunman in an attack Thursday that left one police officer dead and another wounded.

The brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed by police at a printing facility about 20 miles outside of Paris after a seven-hour hostage siege. Cherif told a French TV station he was ""sent by Yemen's Al-Qaeda,"" and a purported member of the terror group claimed it had directed the attack on the magazine, which had mocked Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.",1422

Now I suppose reasonable adults can have conversations about the pros and cons of various domestic violence legislation. However, if you’re opposed to increased protections for battered women, you should perhaps lay off the jokes about women not being equal to men.

And yet, that’s exactly what happened last week. While discussing pending criminal domestic violence legislation, South Carolina Senator Thomas Corbin has this conversation:

At one point in the conversation – which quickly escalated into a confrontation – Shealy is said to have angrily asked Corbin where he “got off” attacking women.



“Well, you know God created man first,” Corbin said, reportedly smirking at Shealy. “Then he took the rib out of man to make woman. And you know, a rib is a lesser cut of meat.”

Given this other incident where he wants Sen. Shealy to leave the room, she being the only woman in the Senate, he clearly thinks that women aren’t equal to men, or he’d have no problem making his bizarre criticism of Common Core in front of her.

But this statement is really over the top, and joke or not, reflects how he really feels about the place of women in society. And for that, he is the Asshole of the Day.

UPDATE: Sen. Shealy didn’t think it was a funny joke.





It is Sen. Corbin’s first time as Asshole of the Day.

I had no idea the video game simulation would be so accurate.

Not only did Madden predict a New England Patriots victory over the Seattle Seahawks, the game predicted the final score of 28-24.

That's very nearly as perfect a Super Bowl prediction as you're likely to find, and it spurs the game's big game track record to 9-3.

Not bad, for a video game.

The Madden prediction also saw the Patriots making a second half comeback for the win. It also predicted Tom Brady as MVP, with 335 yards and four touchdowns.

Brady's actual numbers? Just seven yards short of the prediction with 328 yards passing and four touchdowns. That's...crazy.

The game also predicted Edelman's winning touchdown and was surprisingly close in a number of other key stats.

What the video game didn't anticipate were the final moments of the Super Bowl, which ended not with a bang but with a whimper.

There was no way the video game could predict the awesome, unexpected reception by receiver Jermaine Kearse.

And nobody could have seen that final interception. I mean, who makes a call like that? Not in a video game and certainly not in real life.

Pombe, a traditional Mozambican beer, is made from millet or corn flour. The exact source of the contamination is still unknown, but authorities believe the drink was poisoned with crocodile bile during the course of a funeral on Saturday.

Police are investigating the incident.

693662456393134080,non-rumor,Donald Trump is the least favorably viewed presidential candidate since at least 1992 https://t.co/m7K0X01dsf,http://wapo.st/1Q2sPCV,True,Donald Trump is the least favorably viewed presidential candidate since at least 1992,"Three out of every five Americans views Donald Trump unfavorably, according to Gallup's most recent two-week average for all of the candidates. That's the highest among the Republicans and the highest of any candidate in the race at this point.

It's so high, in fact, that Gallup's Frank Newport wanted to see how it compared to the peak unfavorable ratings earned by every candidate back to 1992, when Gallup began tracking the data as it does now.

No candidate in the past 25 years has been viewed more unfavorably by Americans (Democrat, Republican and independent) than Donald Trump.

George H. W. Bush is the only one that really came close, with his unfavorable ratings spiking just before he lost his reelection in 1992. On the most-popular end of the spectrum are Bernie Sanders and Ben Carson -- both of whom are less well-known than Trump, meaning that fewer people have an opinion one way or the other.

Gallup also noted earlier this week that Ted Cruz's favorability among Republicans had plunged this month, perhaps due to the increased scrutiny he's been facing as the one-time Iowa front-runner. (Or, perhaps, for other reasons.)

There's one small consolation for Republicans worried about an unpopular Trump winning their party's nomination. The third least popular candidate in Gallup's numbers is the person currently leading the Democratic field, Hillary Clinton.",1386

Unfortunately for Apple, things aren't looking much better this week, as MacRumors reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive.

According to the report, the option to ""Reset All Settings,"" found under Settings — General — Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive — permanently.

The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that ""no data or media will be deleted."" However, after some users on MacRumors' forum complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone.

Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents — including Preview and TextEdit files — were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected.

In some scenarios it's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn't publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the ""Reset All Settings"" option.",1386

Obama is set to announce the decision during a ceremony Friday

(CNN) President Barack Obama made his latest push to advance equal pay for women Friday, proposing a new rule that will require companies to report pay data by gender, race and ethnicity.

President Barack Obama made the official announcement at an event marking the seventh anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first piece of legislation Obama signed as President.

The Lilly Ledbetter Act loosened the statute of limitations under which workers can sue employers for pay discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, race, age or disability.

""While we've got a lot to celebrate we knew that our work wasn't done."" President Obama said at the White House Friday. ""We knew we had a lot more to do to close the pay gap between men and women and ensure that no women would ever face the kind of discrimination that Lilly faced on the job.""

The new proposed rule announced Friday -- which would apply to companies that have 100 or more employees -- will require employers to include salary information on a form already submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that currently includes employees' sex and age.

The photos of 54-year-old Colleen Hufford show a woman who doted on her family. Relatives set up the Facebook memorial page describing her as an affectionate grandmother who always had a smile on her face.

“Someday I’ll see you again,” reads a backdrop on the page, which was created to celebrate the life of the Vaughan Foods employee who was murdered last Thursday.

Pictures posted to the memorial page depict a life surrounded by family as Hufford is photographed cradling a baby, relaxing with her husband and enjoying a beautiful autumn day with family.

A memorial fund was also setup on the FundMe website in Hufford’s honor and has already received $662 in pledges.

“She was a loyal wife, mother and a doting grandmother,” the page description reads. “This memorial fund is being set up to help her husband KC, and daughter Kelli with her funeral services and if possible to help with Colleen’s granddaughter Riley’s college fund.”

Hufford’s co-worker — Alton Nolen — allegedly snapped and attacked Hufford just hours after getting fired from his job last Thursday at the food distribution plant in Moore. Co-workers told police that the 30-year-old had attempted to convert them to Islam.",1378

ORIGIN

In the early hours of 12 June 2016, a lone gunman opened fire inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, killing at least 50 people in the deadliest incident of mass shooting in recent U.S. history.

Shortly after news broke of the tragedy, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s Twitter account posted several messages on the subject. One particular tweet caught the attention of the Huffington Post, who ran it under the headline “Donald Trump Tweets Disgusting Humble Brag After Orlando Massacre.”

Trump’s tweet was excerpted and fashioned into a graphic bearing HuffPo’s logo that was posted on Facebook, as seen above. However, while the GOP presidential candidate did tweet that he “appreciate[d] the congrats on being right on radical Islamic terrorism,” his full message was more than just the gloating brag implied by the excerpt:

While an official motive for the mass shooting has not been confirmed as of this writing, ISIS has reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack.

President Obama called the mass shooting “an act of terror” and an “act of hate” when he delivered a statement about it from the White House:",1373

The unidentified man who made the recording says he was using a phone app to create a video text message at the same time the unarmed 18-year-old was killed in a midday confrontation with a cop in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9, according to his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal. ""He didn’t know necessarily what was going on outside until later, and that’s when he put two and two together and realized he may have recorded what was going on at the time,"" Blumenthal said.

Blumenthal said the FBI has interviewed her client and listened to the recording, which was first reported by CNN. NBC News has obtained the recording but cannot independently verify that the sounds on it are linked to the Brown shooting, and the FBI had no comment. Autopsy reports say that Brown was shot at least six times, but up to 11 shots are heard on the recording. It's not clear why there was a pause in the middle, and the recording only contains 12 seconds of audio. ""We don't have any side that we're representing other than the fact that here's a piece of evidence that we want to get to the investigators which may lead to a more complete story,"" Blumenthal said.",1373

By Tuesday, the device\’s fifth day on the market, a few tech blogs were reporting complaints from Apple Inc. iPhone 6 Plus owners that their new smartphones were bending when placed in their pants pockets.

The reports were followed up by a video posted by a video blog called Unbox Therapy, which \”for the sake of science,\” conducted an iPhone 6 Plus bend test on camera. In the 4.5-minute video, Unbox Therapy showed that the larger iPhone 6 Plus bent slightly as host Lewis Hilsenteger applied pressure to the device with his hands.

\”Unfortunate, but under the pressure of my hand, it does bend quite significantly,\” Hilsenteger says in the video. \”Bottom line: Here is an aluminum phone, it is going to bend if you apply enough pressure, like I just did. … Not necessarily the piece of information you want to receive as owners of this new device.\”

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but stay tuned. Whether this news will have an effect on sales of what is expected to be Apple\’s next hot iPhone is yet to be seen. It may turn out that consumers are warned not to stow the iPhone 6 Plus in pockets.

Helric Fredou, 45, the deputy director of the regional judicial police in Limoges turned his gun on himself last Wednesday night, hours after Cherif and Said Kouachi killed 12 people in an Islamist rampage, including two policemen.

He had been tasked with investigating the family of one of the victims, but died before handing in the report.

He had reportedly interviewed families of Charlie Hebdo victims in the hours after the attack.

It is not known if his decision to commit suicide has any link to the Charlie Hebdo killings.

""We are all stunned. He was someone who was very humane and close to people,"" said Pascal Cayla of the Alliance union.

Colleagues said Mr Fredou had been deeply affected by the suicide of the number three of the Limoges judicial police in 2013 after he discovered the body. His colleague had left a note citing ""personal reasons"".

Since the twin attacks last week that rocked France and left 17 people dead, there has been an outpouring of support for the country's police force, which polls regularly suggest has a poor image among many French.

Washington (CNN) Ted Cruz is trying to tamp down expectations in the final hours before Iowans cast the first ballots of the 2016 primary season as a new poll shows him trailing GOP front-runner Donald Trump in the Hawkeye State.

""We don't view any state as a 'must-win,' "" the Texas senator told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union."" ""I think we're positioned to do very well here in Iowa. I think we've worked very hard. You know the grassroots team we've got is unbelievable, it is second to none.""

Cruz is hoping that evangelicals and conservatives frustrated with the Washington establishment will hand him a victory in the critical first-in-the-nation caucus state. But Cruz, who once led in several Iowa polls, would need to pull off an underdog victory: a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics survey released Saturday night found him trailing Donald Trump, 23% to 28%.

In explaining his pitch to voters, Cruz told Tapper he would follow through on his conservative campaign pledges, unlike his Republican opponents.

""The central question in this primary is trust,"" Cruz said. ""We are tired of being burned.""

She was 81.

Family members confirmed the death to WFAB-9, telling the news station she died at her home in Zachary, Louisiana, with family members by her side.

Douglas earned nationwide fame as Elly May, and told the Associated Press in 2009 that she beat out 500 other actresses for the role in part because the character’s story mirrored her humble beginnings as a poor farm girl with Southern roots. Her audition included her expertly milking a goat, per request.

“I had milked cows before,” she said. “I figured they were equipped the same, so I just went on over and did it.”

Douglas left farm life behind after entering beauty pageants, winning titles including Miss Baton Rogue and Miss New Orleans before moving to New York to pursue a career in entertainment.

She landed the role of Elly May in 1962 and remained on the show until it ended its run in 1971 – and she didn’t mind that it typecast her.

“So many kinds of people relate to Elly May,” the twice-divorced star told the AP after returning to her native Louisiana to spend her golden years engaged in activities including baling hay and picking blueberries. “So many people love her, and that means a lot to me.”",1340

At the same time, those individuals who will one day pay their female classmates a fraction of the industry standard have fallen further behind.” Malone added that if current trends in education continue, women will soon outnumber nearly all future tech workers, financial analysts, and government leaders at the nation’s universities by a two-to-one margin.",1330

According to Conners, she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were pulling out of a gas station when multiple police cars appeared, blocking them inside. While Conners claims that her boyfriend attempted to drive around the cars, police counter that Lee drove directly at them, making the officer fear for his life. He then pulled out a nonlethal bean bag gun and fired at Conners.

“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of situation,” Donnell Conners, Dornella’s father, told KMOV. “I understand tough job, I understand that it was chaos, there was no reason to fire upon innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”

He was 72.

Lawson died Jan. 10 at his home in San Luis Obispo of respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, his wife, Susan Lawson said Sunday.

Lawson was an actor with bit parts on such TV shows as Baretta and The Streets of San Francisco when he was hired to appear in print Marlboro ads from 1978 to 1981. His other credits include Charlie's Angels, Dynasty and Baywatch. His wife said injuries sustained on the set of a Western film ended his career in 1997.

A smoker since age 14, Lawson later appeared in an anti-smoking commercial that parodied the Marlboro man and an Entertainment Tonight segment to discuss the negative effects of smoking. Susan said her husband was proud of the interview, even though he was smoking at the time and continued the habit until he was diagnosed with COPD.

""He knew the cigarettes had a hold on him,"" she said. ""He knew, yet he still couldn't stop.""

A few actors and models who pitched Marlboro brand cigarettes have died of smoking-related diseases. They include David Millar, who died of emphysema in 1987, and David McLean, who died of lung cancer in 1995.

Lawson was also survived by six children, 18 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.",1326

North Korea describes it as a place where the country launches satellites into space.

But U.S. spy satellites are keeping a sharp eye on North Korea's Sohae Satellite Launching Station at Tongchang-ri.

Trump explained his art to The New York Times editorial board, telling them that when he sees people at one of his rallies he just throws out a line that he knows will get them riled up.

""If it gets a little boring, if I see people starting to sort of, maybe thinking about leaving, I can sort of tell the audience, I just say, ‘We will build the wall!’ and they go nuts,” he told the Times' editorial board.

Throwing out red meat to rile up base supporters is nothing new for politicians from either party. But Trump has taken the strategy of playing to Americans' worst fears and anxieties to a new level, proposing deporting all undocumented immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the United States.

Trump's strategy does seem to have succeeded so far. Stations have granted him unprecedented attention and he leads the Republican field of presidential candidates.

Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.

""Due to the lapse in federal funding, this Office of Justice Programs website is unavailable,"" the message reads, just below a U.S. Department of Justice seal.

The website normally displays urgent alerts from across the nation about the most at-risk missing children, helping to connect citizens and law enforcement across all participating jurisdictions.

It remained unclear Sunday night exactly how the shutdown might otherwise reduce an Amber Alert's effectiveness, if one should be issued during the shutdown.

California recently used the Amber Alert system when a San Diego County man killed a close friend and her child, then kidnapped her daughter, Hannah Anderson, a teenager.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday that women who had abortions should face “some form of punishment” if Republicans were successful in banning the practice.

During a town hall event that set to air on MSNBC Wednesday night, host Chris Matthews insisted that Trump could not dodge the question of how to enforce an abortion ban.

“Look, people in certain parts of the Republican Party, conservative Republicans, would say, ‘Yes, it should,’” Trump replied, according to a transcript obtained by Bloomberg. “I would say it’s a very serious problem and it’s a problem we have to decide on. Are you going to send them to jail?”

“There has to be some form of punishment,” he said.

“For the woman?” Matthews pressed.

“Yeah,” Trump replied, adding that the punishment would “have to be determined.”

“They’ve set the law and frankly the judges, you’re going to have a very big election coming up for that reason because you have judges where it’s a real tipping point and with the loss of Scalia, who was a very strong conservative, this presidential election is going to be very important,” the candidate opined. “When you say what’s the law, nobody knows what the law is going to be.

Cases range from 1940s to 1950s

(CNN) The truth is out there: The CIA has released hundreds of declassified documents detailing investigations into possible alien life.

The Central Intelligence Agency posted documents of reported Unidentified Flying Objects that range in date from the late 1940s to the 1950s. While playing off the hype of the TV show reboot ""The X-Files,"" the CIA broke down the cases into two categories, whether you side with Agent Mulder or Agent Scully.

Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully and David Duchovny as Fox Mulder in the Fox series ""The X-Files.""

For believers in alien life, and those who want to channel your inner Mulder, one case you can choose to investigate is the case of a flying saucer in Germany in 1952.

According to CIA reports , an eyewitness told investigators that an object ""resembling a huge flying pan"" landed in a forest clearing in the Soviet zone of Germany in 1952. The eyewitness said once he was closer to the area where it landed, he saw two men dressed in shiny metallic clothing. The men were stooped over looking at a large object but were spooked by the eyewitness. The mysterious men jumped into the large flying pan object and it spun out into the sky.

Perfect Obama's dad born in Africa, Mitt Romney's dad born in Mexico. Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebate — Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) January 20, 2012

Ostensibly, Pierson is somehow trying to imply that having a parent born overseas makes someone less American, or to put it in more menacing, eugenical terms, “less pure.” It’s also worth noting that Donald Trump’s mother was actually born in Scotland—though I can’t for the life of me figure out why she might have let that one slide (I can).

Pierson—who, like her boss, wants to ban all Muslims from being able to enter the U.S.—is also a big proponent of Donald Trump using America’s arsenal in some capacity (any capacity!), saying, “What good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you’re afraid to use it?”

Four years before Pierson tweeted about the lack of pure breeds in American politics, she sued her employer for racial discrimination.

We’ve reached out to Pierson for comment on the tweet (which, at the time of publication, has yet to be deleted) and will update if and when we hear back.

The body of Deandre Joshua, 20, was found at around 9 a.m. inside a white Pontiac with the driver’s side window shot out near the Canfield Green Apartments, USA Today reports. The apartment complex is near the site where Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August.

Joshua’s family members said they believed his death was related to the massive protests incited by a grand jury’s announcement on Monday night that they would not bring charges against Wilson for shooting Brown.

Police are investigating Joshua’s death as a homicide, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Even so, his grandmother, Renita Towns, has doubts about the amount of effort they’re going to put in.

""Police don't care — he's black,” she told USA Today.

Towns’ sentiments echo statements made by Leslie McSpadden, Michael Brown’s mother, shortly after the announcement that Wilson wouldn’t be indicted. “They still don’t care,” she said, addressing a crowd of supporters shortly before breaking into sobs. “They’re never gonna care. I’ve been here my whole life.”

Asked Sunday by CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" whether voters should interpret his refusal to engage Clinton on the email issue to mean that Clinton did nothing wrong, Sanders replied with a firm, ""No.""

""Nope, nope. That is not, I think, a fair assessment. That is, I think, a very serious issue,"" Sanders said. ""There is a legal process taking place, I do not want to politicize that issue. It is not my style.""

Sanders famously said in the first Democratic debate that he was tired of hearing about Clinton's ""damn emails,"" brushing aside one of the biggest issues Republicans have raised to attack Clinton during the 2016 presidential cycle.

Sanders assessment that Clinton's use of private email on a private server during her time as secretary of state is a ""very serious issue"" comes after the State Department announced Friday that it was withholding 22 emails determined to be ""top secret"" by the intelligence community. The emails were not marked as classified at the time they were sent.

She added a third breast.

Jasmine Tridevil of Tampa says she no longer wants to date and figured that the best way to do that would be to undergo plastic surgery to add an extra boob.

According to New York magazine, Tridevil, 21, approached more than 50 doctors to find one that would perform the surgery. The operation took place a few months ago and entailed taking skin tissue from Tridevil's abdomen and then adding silicon to the implant.

Tridevil, a massage therapist, tattooed an areola to the new appendage to make it appear more natural.

The image of a woman with three breasts conjures up memories of the classic Arnold Schwarzenegger film ""Total Recall.""

The New York Post says Tridevil's dream is to become a celebrity and that she saved up for two years for the operation and a film crew to follow her around after the procedure.

Tridevil writes about her 3-boob exploits on her personal Facebook page with her latest post saying, ""Don't be afraid to be different... that's what makes you beautiful.""

Pepsi has confirmed reports that it's been working on a Doritos-flavored soft drink.

“Dewitos” was first reported by Kent State University Freshman Steve Barnes, who shared an image of the odd combination on Reddit. Barnes claimed that Pepsi was not only offering the nacho-flavored tincture but an assortment of other novelty sodas including lemon ginger, rainbow sherbet, and mango habanero.

Quartz reached out to Pepsi and received a statement from a spokesperson revealing that the taste-tests were real.

“We are always testing out new flavors of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us,” read the statement. “We opened up the DEW flavor vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities.”

Barnes reported that the Dorritos-flavored drink actually did taste like the popular chips, but said the rainbow sherbet tasted like medicine.

The company originally planned to use KKK as the ""Krispy Kreme Klub."" Other acitivities during the county's half-term, which runs from Feb. 16 to Feb. 22nd, included Funday Monday, Coloring Tuesday, Face Painting Thursday, Balloon Madness and Board Games Galore.

An Afghan woman has killed at least 25 Taliban militants to avenge the murder of her son who was a police officer in western Farah province.

According to reports, Reza Gul was forced to pick up arms after her son was shot dead by Taliban militants in front of her eyes.

Her son was leading a small group of police forces in a check post located in a village of Farah province.

She was supported by her daughter and daughter-in-law during the gun battle which lasted for almost 7 hours that left at least 25 Taliban militants dead and five others injured.

Sediq Sediq, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior (MoI) said the armed campaign by women against the Taliban militants is a symbol of a major revolution and public uprising against the group.

The Taliban militants group has not commented regarding the incident so far.

Farah is among the volatile provinces in western Afghanistan where anti-government armed militants are actively operating in its various districts and frequently carry out insurgency activities.

Washington (CNN) Tommy Chong loves Bernie Sanders, and he describes that affection for the insurgent candidate in a way only Tommy Chong can.

""Bernie's like a kush, like the best kind of weed you can get, because he's the answer to all our problems,"" Chong told CNN this week.

To prove it, he's releasing a public service announcement supporting Sanders for president rife with the tongue-in-cheek marijuana jokes that ran throughout the ""Cheech and Chong"" comedies of the late '70s.

""There is one candidate who stands head and shoulders above them all who has weathered many storms and is totally ready to be the commander in chief, or the commander in kush, as I like to say,"" Chong said in a copy of the PSA given to CNN.

In the spot, he compares former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to a green plant not yet ready for harvesting, and Hillary Clinton to a wilted house plant with no energy left. But Sanders, in Chong's PSA, is a glowing rose bush ready to be, ahem, harvested.

But his curiosity turned to shock when a puppy-sized spider bristled under his flashlight.

“When I turned on the light, I couldn’t quite understand what I was seeing,” Naskrecki, an entomologist and photographer at Harvard University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, told Live Science.

The South American Goliath birdeater is the world’s largest spider, with a leg span of up to a foot (or the size of “a child’s forearm”) and weighing more than 6 ounces.

“Its feet have hardened tips and claws that produce a very distinct, clicking sound, not unlike that of a horse’s hoofs hitting the ground,” Naskrecki wrote on his blog, The Smaller Majority.

Naskrecki, who spotted the colossal creature in a South American rainforest in 2012, saw it rub its hind legs against its abdomen, sending out hairs with tiny barbs on them. He said the barbs are “extremely painful and itchy.”

The highly venomous arachnid also has 2-inch fangs.

But the good news is, even if it bites you, “a chicken can probably do more damage,” Naskrecki said.

Naskrecki caught the female and took her back to his lab to study.

Washington (CNN) Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump maintain wide leads in their respective primary races in New Hampshire, according to a new CNN/WMUR poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.

On the Republican side, Trump continues to hold more than double the support of his nearest competitor, while the race for second and third place remains muddled: Just 6 points separate the second place candidate from the one in fifth place.

Overall, 30% of likely Republican primary voters back Trump, and behind him, the field vying for second includes Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 12%, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 11%, Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 9%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 8% and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with 6%.

Still, the sense of Trump's inevitability has grown, and two-thirds of likely GOP primary voters now say they expect the businessman to win the state's primary. No other candidate hits double-digits.

According to The Vancouver Province’s Tony Gallagher, an expansion team in Las Vegas is “a done deal.”

“Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.”

With a team in Las Vegas “all but assured,” Gallagher also implies that talk of a Seattle expansion isn’t without merit as many potential owners – including Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman – have shown plenty of interest.

The biggest obstacle facing Seattle is the lack of an NHL-calibre arena, as Bettman explained on Sportsnet 590 The Fan in June is that “the building situation is very unsettled and frankly if there was no reasonable prospect of a building coming anytime soon.”

The addition of two teams in the Western Conference would pull it even with the 16-team Eastern Conference. However, Gallagher indicates the NHL could expand beyond only two teams, mentioning Quebec City and Kansas City.",1190

Though we’ve only ever seen Camila Cabello flex her musical magic in group settings — both with Fifth Harmony and with Shawn Mendes — she shines just as bright on her own. Case in point: The 18-year-old had a solo jam session on Monday (Jan. 25), during which she recorded herself singing and strumming along to Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself.”

After nailing the original song’s mellow chorus, Camila decided to completely revamp the bridge by adding in her own lyrics: “You tried to make me insecure/ You tried to break me, maybe ‘cause you couldn’t love yourself.”

For the third and final clip, she continued her own addition to the song, singing, “But your poison was the cure/ And by accident you showed me how to love myself.”

Camila wrote in each clip’s caption that she was just “playin around,” but I think we can all agree her casual jam should be turned into a proper, full-length cover. Or maybe even a duet with JB himself? Just sayin', guy-girl duets are totally having a moment lately, between Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez's ""We Don't Talk Anymore,"" and Ariana Grande and Nathan Sykes' ""Over and Over Again.""

Rare Fanged Deer Confirmed in Afghanistan After 60 Years,"Cue the vampire jokes: A deer with fang-like canine teeth has been spotted in northeastern Afghanistan, more than 60 years after the species was last confirmed to live there. The Kashmir musk deer, Moschus cupreus, was observed by scientists in 1948 but had not officially been recorded there until a team from the Wildlife Conservation Society, Leeds University and Nuristan province, Afghanistan, reported seeing the creatures. Even with concerted effort the team only had five sightings, of at most three individuals, the society said.

Kashmir musk deer live in the mountains of extreme northern India and Pakistan and northern Afghanistan, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. So little is known about them that the list doesn’t even hazard a guess at how many still exist. Key problems for the species, which the Red List classifies as endangered: Musk in the males’ scent glands can be sold for $45,000 per kilogram (local hunters get $200-$250 per gland) on international markets, and the forests that the deer depend on are threatened by logging. And the fangs? The males use those in jousting during the rutting season.

The missive has gone viral in social media.

Among the banned words that ruffled his feathers:

“Chill (unless we are talking about something that is chilled),” “Fool,” “Cuz (this goes for cousin and because), “Bruh,” “Bae” and “Guh.”

Even the word “Ebola” is off-limits.

“Stop accusing people of having ebola,” Eric, whose last name is unknown, reportedly warned the staff in the letter, a copy of which was posted to Reddit on Nov. 6.

“You will speak properly when you walk through these doors,” he wrote. “You are a professional so speak professionally.”

He also warned them not to deface the list by crossing out any of the words.

“Scratch it out + you lose your employee meals!” he added by hand to the typed document.

One of the workers posted a copy of the note on Reddit, writing: “I work at Chick-fil-a and Eric, our manager, is tired of our s***.”

Even the resolve of some vegetarians can crumble when faced with a juicy cheeseburger after a long night of drinking, according to a new survey.

Mmm Mmm!

The survey of 1,789 Brits who claimed to be vegetarians found that 37% of the respondents admitted to eating meat after having too much to drink. The survey by the discount website VoucherCodesPro found that while some break the rules, the majority of vegetarians stick to their dietary restrictions, Fox News reported.

Sixty-three percent of vegetarians reported that they did not eat meat regardless of how much they drank.

When asked how often the rule breakers ate meat, the responses varied --- 34% said every time they drink, 26% said fairly often, 22% said rarely, and 18% said occasionally.

The man also was carrying a Quran, Le Prevost said. He told police during questioning that he was carrying the guns for his own protection, according to the deputy chief.

An old clip of Michael Jackson suggests that he may not have been enthusiastic about the choice either if he was alive today.

In his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, posted on Twitter on Monday, the King of Pop was asked to clarify a rumor that he wanted a young white boy to star as him in a Pepsi commercial. Jackson swiftly refuted the rumor.

""That's the most ridiculous, horrifying story I've ever heard,"" he told Oprah. ""Why would I want a white child to play me? I'm a black American. I'm proud to be a black American. I am proud of my race. I am proud of who I am. I have a lot of pride in who I am and dignity.""

I'm a black American. I'm proud to be a black American. I am proud of my race. Michael Jackson on rumors of a white actor playing him in 1993

In the full clip, MJ was so riled up that Oprah had to interrupt him to move on to the next question.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX/WTTE) — A Columbus police officer was rushed to the hospital after officials say he cut his mouth after biting into a sandwich, which contained several shards of glass from a restaurant on East Long Street Monday afternoon.

The officer was taken to Grant Medical Center around 3 p.m. where he’s being held overnight. The officer is expected to be okay, according to investigators.

Police say the officer bit into the sandwich and felt what was a grisly texture as well as a crunching sound. When he looked into the sandwich, he saw the glass. When he checked his mouth, he saw it was bleeding. (read more with video report)

(CNN) Shooting and a stabbing broke out at a motorcycle show in Denver on Saturday afternoon, leaving one person dead and seven people injured, authorities said.

Two rival motorcycle clubs were ""possibly"" involved in the violence at the Colorado Motorcycle Expo, police Chief Robert White said at a press conference.

The Denver Post quoted a witness , who didn't want to be identified because of fear of retaliation, as saying the violence involved rival biker gangs. Video taken after the shooting showed police talking to groups of men wearing jackets with motorcycle club patches.

White said about 10,000 people were inside the National Western Complex hall at 12:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. ET) when shots were fired.

Investigators think two or more people exchanged gunfire, he said, but the cause of the shooting is still being investigated.

Perhaps the person in charge didn't know the white supremacist group, due to it starting in the former Kolonies.

A spokeswoman for the Hull branch of Krispy Kreme said that the flyers were “sent from the head office, so it has been advertised at all the outlets."" The week of festivities is aimed at kids who are on half-term holidays from school.

On Tuesday the iPhone 6 Plus was forced to confront a question near the hearts of many new owners: will it bend?

In a word: Yes.

After photos of slightly bent iPhones began cropping up on social media, the folks at Unbox Therapy took to YouTube to decide once and for all whether the iPhone 6 Plus really had a bending problem.

The video shows a man take out his iPhone 6 Plus, which he apparently purchased last Friday, and try to break it in half.

At one point the iPhone looked as if it would snap in half, but after exerting ample force on the phone, the tester was able to do no more than bend the aluminum shell.

Still, it's unclear how or why iPhones are bending in people's pockets. It seems you need to apply a lot of force. Other tech journalists have said iPhone 6 Plus users should wear looser jeans, but you can chalk this up as a victory for the smaller, more practical 4.7-inch iPhone 6.

Health officials have said that passengers at the airport were not at risk for exposure to Ebola because Duncan was not symptomatic at the time of his flight.

Eric Lawson, a working actor who portrayed the Marlboro Man in cigarette ads during the late 1970s, has died. He was 72.

Lawson's wife, Susan Lawson, said Sunday that her husband died Jan. 10 at his California home. The cause was respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.

The ruggedly handsome Lawson portrayed the smoking cowboy in Marlboro print ads from 1978 to 1981. He also had bit parts in such TV shows as ""Baretta"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" before injuries sustained on the set of a Western film ended his acting career.

A smoker since age 14, Lawson later appeared in an anti-smoking commercial that parodied the Marlboro Man and an ""Entertainment Tonight"" segment to discuss the negative effects of smoking.

He is also survived by six children.

These latest comments by the Obama White House reportedly have FBI and Justice Department officials “Super Pissed Off.”

Big Bank Hank, who was a member of the Sugarhill Gang rap group, passed away Tuesday morning in New Jersey after a long battle of cancer. He was 57.

The group's manager confirmed the death to Rolling Stone and said his bandmates Wonder Mike and Master Gee were informed of the news.

Hank, who was born Henry Jackson, is well-known for Sugarhill Gang's single ""Rapper's Delight."" The multi-platinum hit was one of the first rap songs played on the radio and became the first hip-hop single to become a Top 40 Billboard chart hit.

The 1979 classic tune has lived on thanks to memorable renditions from Brian Williams and Ellen Albertini Dow. How can we forget that scene from The Wedding Singer?",772

Macrumors reports that several iPhone 6 Plus users have found that their phones became bent after they sat or bent over with the phones in their pockets. This, of course, is totally understandable, since thinner phones are just more malleable (it’s physics).

Amber alert website down due to government shutdown,"Originally posted at 8:01 p.m. Sunday.

The Amber alert website, the national missing-child warning program, has been shut off due to the government shutdown, according to the Department of Justice.

“Due to the lapse in federal funding, this Office of Justice Programs website is unavailable,” it says on amberalert.gov.

Just 17 percent of the government is shut down, and Friday the Obama administration allowed union representatives to return to work.

So, union members could return to work, but the website to alert Americans to missing children had to be taken down?
